they're offering do they have a hundred percent pay after the ...\nUm and if they do and you're healthy or you're sick either one it comes out better kind of in the middle it doesn't necessarily come out better but if you're going to go to the doctor will every year and then they pick up a hundred percent that's a great deal if you got like a chronic illness\nAnd or if you're hardly ever sick Ramsey is knock on wood we hardly ever\nEnd up at the dock then in that case obviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to the doctor ... so we just end up with a cheaper premium is what ends up with us and the ability to put money into\nThe health savings account which creates a tax deductible account and you can use that money of course to meet your ducked double or any other\nHealth issues that you want to cover as you go along so good question go talk to you Annette thank you for calling in Dennis is with us Dennis is in Rochester, Minnesota Hi Dennis how are you\nI'm well under seltzer better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well my wife and I started your program back in June and um we've been working our way through where they just have to\nUm we have some whole life\nLife insurance policies um each of our parents took all life insurance on us when we were younger we still have those policies and the more we got married we each took out a policy\nBoth the mole life um the cash value on their policies is about eleven thousand dollars mhm and we're wondering if we should cash out the policy is after getting her policy\nAnd use that money to put into our that snowball\nAbsolutely\nYeah there are horrible product they're just um you know the whole life has to payday lender in the middle class I mean it just as I\n... a ridiculously low right of return on your money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value of the policy they don't pay the the cash value also which means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears at death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad\nProduct the math on it is horrendous and uh you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance new you're investing anywhere except on in a life insurance product and so um that's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\n\nWould there be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the in other words what you paid into it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't write the law but you end up with having put more into it\nThen you get out so there is no gain now\nYes um and it happens about five percent of the time with an ... with a very very old whole life policy there it is possible that the cash value is greater than most pay\nAnd but you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nFor Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck you don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not taxable event when\nYou lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nHi Dave I'm doing good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nA number and then I just got married in August and we're combining our finances and everything else [laughter]\nUm and we're working on paying off all of our cat we just had off his car like three days ago Hervey Jay ...\nYeah I have mine should be paid off by the end of this year which is great and the next thing we're going to tackle as a rental property that eye on 'em and then after that was good until the\nMarkets that we live and so we're planning on saving up for the three to six months of emergency fund but we're not sure how much we can save them\nFor two income family obviously we have no kids on but if both of my tenants leads and my rental properties that are required like a really different amount that if I have to have that so we're trying to figure out how much it's safer makes sense\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff breakdown on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account for your rentals digging out\nI can match oh ... okay I Would I Would open\nUp a separate checking account just for the rentals and put pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there put the rents in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rentals 'cause what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxed boy cheer\n'em because everything else was going to be deducted well all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account\nTo cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I might keep that did it that way as separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business right off okay and then over but then at home I Would have three to six months or expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rentals covered in the rental account than you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of household expenses as you're\nKnown as your game plan and and so forth so a good question thanks for joining Joe's in Austin, Texas Hi Joe I'm short on time go straight to your question\nDave I'm I have a new one year old\nAnd I was wanting to get your advice on how to save her future so we have a I clean I'm cleaning it up and then getting money I'm from birthdays and um you know they're all day\nAnd I was going to know how what we should do with that money and how can we teach them financial responsibility as he gets older\nCool well good for you what a great dead question yeah you just um I Would have the money inside the five twenty nine invested in good growth stocks mutual funds were course or five twenty nine is used for college\nAnd so we're going to teach him that his college money is there and was showing that money as he gets older he didn't need to understand it four years old don't don't worry about that but then there's four

I think there's a lot different than that you\nKnow K. you know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the flat with monster these are things that you see and you're like going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen\nOn in search of a sudden has never been talked about on coast to coast they I'm not saying that uh you know I've talked about really that I that I Know about that I've seen\nAnd you know that ... this reminds me of the myths gave the movie the mist remember the missed it was a it was a ... veil and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that you know that some quantum joke\nScience can beat us with dimensional theories that point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of the planet wear the veil is thinner or\nThere's some extra dimensional vortex where a second genesis occurred parallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to be the most powerful due to their position to be the appropriate ritual perform there by the writer fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nIt could open the best and new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned\nThat there are wormholes reporters that can be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and\nThose real into these can pass through and hot mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead arrowhead project and the whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this miss and rain and enveloped a small town and during the night large insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pets eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great widow wars and they can only be described as deadly spider like predators\nEach about the size of a small dog\nAnd these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like cloth and flesh\nAnd in both the book in the film\nGreat widower is simply killed their prey would they're acidic ... but in the film\nThey also have the ability to capture and lay off hundreds of eggs\nIn the living human host\nThe eggs take about a data hatch and they multiplied quickly now\nThe looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being Ruben ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know that uh don't Toro did the show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies\nBecause of the fact that this this Roach or whatever it is gets to me the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man and black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature see\nWhen you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in the movie like mimic these creatures are terrifying and and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay other movie and then they said we based many if there is the creatures\nOn supposed second genesis creatures that were proposed by science\nThey were based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals promote more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still basically just animals made of flesh and blood nothing supernatural about them okay but they are from\nA second genesis ecosystem\nThe brutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when the guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about\nRegard to opening dimensions and allowing these wild creatures in for study journey rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave\nWhich is a Canadian company sewing machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of kindred systems or kindred AI which is to sell the start up your founded with others that was back in twenty fourteen and he dedicated the whole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but\nHis goal is within the way of quantum computers he wants to summon a tsunami of demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old ones spoken of\nBy horror Arthur H.

with a big block that shoe macabre stories dumping\nBarbie NATO on the program something if it's something it's invested her infested or homes you know what it is she wondered if it was some sort of demonic\nThing one of them some sort of a ... an alien thing wondering if it's something that she doesn't understand but we do have inspectors literal inspectors that are going to go to our house and inspect this way she doesn't have to pay out any more money to find out\nSomething that she doesn't already know or what have you but we have them we're going to be arranged you would get them to her and uh that we will get a logical scientific explanation now that doesn't hold where to go further we're going to uh probably up some goes to the theaters or maybe in some other investigators do you mean all just to go and if there's something demonic going on there\nUh but uh you know one of the things that we do on this program and we've done it many times is that we actually have to vet the stories about the thing with Barbie\nIs but she came to a news press conference okay and we were at a news to press conference in Oregon or some of the tour went to Seattle and beyond she came to that press conference to ask the news department\nWhat could be done about the home and ... how it could be inspected so it was not\nBut she had me she asked me if I knew anything about it there was something paranormal about it I was at bat I thought I don't know what George my audience and find out of the biggest paranormal in\nIt so this is why I brought Barbie on the show this is not\nTo try and convince you something paranormal this is an investigation and process now\nUh it's also I thought appropriate for Halloween to talk about this the reason why is because I don't know about you but creepy crawly crap coming out of a house whether it be spiders or any other bugs or or whether it be rats are mice or anything else are terribly creepy\nThey are terribly creepy and a and this is why I uh this is why I wanted to talk about this tonight\nUh if anyone you know if anyone has had this happen to them or something that they can claim that they've had happened to them\nLike to hear the story because you know things that are out of the ordinary things are anomalous\nAre certainly worthy you're talking about especially around Halloween and so I said the chauffeur around this time because I wanted people you know because that's all part of Halloween right the creepy crawly easy we the spider things going down up and the ads crazy but there are these are things that happen\nAnd uh but I'm going to talk to ... this is something that's really out of the ordinary Jason calling from California how are you tonight\nMan good how are you doing great now you sent me some pictures
