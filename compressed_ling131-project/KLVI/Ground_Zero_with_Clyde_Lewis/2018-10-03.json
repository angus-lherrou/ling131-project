{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "I take home about five hey every month that take out\nSo sixty thousand is your take home so that means you're probably making Seventy five eighty give or take okay when you put your twenty five percent tax bracket right\nNow if you were to cash out the Seventeen thousand out of your savings out of your retirement the government is going to charge you a ten percent penalty wash your twenty five percent tax rate\nSo you're going to get kicked in the teeth to the tune of thirty five percent\nSo it's kind of like saying hey Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty five percent interest to pay off my student loan answer would be and I\nKnow you see what I'm saying\nYeah they'd have to lay down\nThe good news is you won the argument the bad news is you both have to read the book again [laughter]\nAll right thanks for the call Rick Carruthers rex in Fort Lauderdale Florida Hi Rick how're you\nGuys are how are you better than others or what's up I'm just calling about a product I have a I bought a while back all the Wii U L\nA very universal life yes\nYes sir Yes sir I'm and I'm not really sure what to do with it I'm not I know I'm not a fan of it but again even when I talk my eyes are on the ins and outs of it like to walk away confused and not sure what to do with it but\nThat's because of that is one of the techniques they used to get people to keep it came in the dark and feed them little neuro [laughter] oh mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter] so\nAh ... the deal is is it's a cash value life insurance policy there are three types her whole life universal variable universal life and just verbal life and a universe alive or variable universal laws and variable universal sometimes has a mutual fund selection the inside of it those years\nAgo yeah okay and so what happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it because you've not seen good returns\n[noise] no it's about eight percent returns but all the fees and built into it I think that it no more yeah\nWell and you usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll ... somewhere in the seven range or after fees\nWhich if you're just bought the mutual fund you're motivated ten or twelve and your case you're making eight and their fees are getting you down probably in the four ranger actually will be my guess usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying the mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking you in the teeth to the tune of another four or five percent that's where it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable Peru\nAnd ah the cheapest term insurance you can buy is term insurance for one year\nAre based on your age that year and then it adjusts up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year for one year it's not the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year\nSo you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly okay less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs does increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[laughter] I have not\nOkay and uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy\nIn and gives you less expensive term insurance and when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat makes sense and plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it so it's a horrible plan when you die but uh it's just really bad while you're alive and it gets really worse when you die so what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place\nAnd then drop this garbage into your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet is because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just did that just got ripped and this also means you're probably need a new financial advisor\nBecause I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial advisor\nIt's certainly possible [laughter] so it sounds like it doesn't sound like a most of the people in the mutual fund world don't sell this crap\nI say that they get on the actual funds and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them don't sell this crap because nobody believes in the garbage except the life insurance people nobody anymore nobody there's no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces as by whole live life insurance or by cash value in terms of any kind of their little one out there\nThere are just the cost of math is just so horrible and you figured that part out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and hadn't a pea under shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you've ever understood at that you drop it and him to probably so I'm thinking you need a new advisor and you need to get some term insurance ... you need to drop this garbage that's what I Would do\nThanks for the call rather open

be this eclipse and then we better be prepared for something happening because you know\nUm we\nSee the uh\nWell see the repercussions of everything happening you know September through through October\nAnd then we have the shooting and uh of course ah when I was talking with Alex about nine eleven um I say I said to him I said you know you look at what they you know the project for new American Century look what they wrote about\nIn the new Pearl Harbor idea that they produce the demand you are the signatories on the on the document\nAnd said you look at the uh you you look at what they've written about new Pearl Harbor and then they then they said that there was going to be or there can be a even a a biological attack since we're a biological attack that\nCould happen and ah it would certainly uh\nMake differences in political movements that would change the way politics\nWould run and of course I'm In nine eleven you know during the nine eleven attacks after nine eleven attacks in fact I Believe it was a just a few weeks or a week afterwards and then everything you know started happening and it wasn't until about like October fourth I Believe of ah\nOf two thousand one where we started to see that many people were dying from exposure to anthrax\nAnd so I'm Joan said to me you know when I was on the air with him I said what do you think the final ... gonna be and I says I said to him I said well I you know a kind of hesitated bit because I was afraid to commit to something because you know you commit to something like\nIf you if you're a born again preaching say the world's going to and like if it's going to end at the end of the ... you know damn good well it's not going to end right because just saying it makes it not happen um so I told him I said I'll tell you it's a biological attack on the United states\nAnd ah I said\nYou know things are just kind of bizarre right now I talked about the ... exercise and talked about the the er the pandemic and they told them about how they're all being ... they're all preparing we have all these uh\nYou know tabletop exercises about biological pandemic advance biological attacks and um\nYou know the idea of a biological attack or some sort of biological chemical weapon being use I you know we speculated on many different ways of this would happen would be carried out whether it would be through an arrow slides attack or you know made him ... it'd be released I I was very surprised though\nUm\nIt was very surprised and and I and I and I wasn't I guess because I I wondered when it was going to happen I didn't think it would happen today but I read today that the Pentagon reporter that envelopes containing the biological poison and rice and\nArrived at the Pentagon I'm the opposite president Senator Ted Cruz is off\nSo I'm a\nBiological attack a happen today um biological\nPoison rice and I'd taken from caster beans I remember when you know back in the day what made you drink castor oil in order to purge crap in your body well there's a reason why is because Castro beans can be made into poison\nAnd um it's a it's it's rice and\nAnd it was reported a of the two packages containing rice in were intercepted on the way the Pentagon and\nHe was confirmed by the department of defense officials that the parcels were there they indicated that the um the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flag mail delivery building which is located next door to the defense department's massive headquarters in Washington DC\nAnd you know I'm the FBI\nNow is involved with this and they there are actually been called in to\nLead the investigation into the packages which are addressed the secretary of defense James Mattis and chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson and of course there was a letter sent to the president um here's the FBI statement they said uh this is the FBI or the statement they they issued\nOn Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents to possession of too suspicious armed groups that have been screened at the Pentagon mail facility those on the lips are currently undergoing further testing as this ongoing we will have no further comment\nSo as the Washington DC area work to determine the origin of the rights to attack news also broke out the two individuals have been hospitalized after being exposed to a\nPowdery substance in the mail send to the Texas set to Texas it was a actually a ... it wasn't in Texas it was um [noise]\nIt ... I maybe I'm trying to figure out it was his office Ted Cruz's office where it happened yes there was in Houston, Texas Houston, Texas they sent a Senator Ted Cruz is off as a a rice you as well or two people were hospitalized or we don't know um how they're doing\nA cruise office said they received a piece of\nMail\nAddress the Senator Cruz this morning when the male is open it contained the white powdery substance the ninth floor of the Phoenix tower\nWas evacuated after the packages found the Pentagon also reported that rice it was the fact that in the mail and of course the rights from since President Trump so um\nYou know so as we predicted um this has happened much like what happened I mean if you remember a half a dozen leather letters um\nContaining anthrax spores were mailed to journalists and politicians beginning one week\nAfter the nine eleven attacks for leaders was spores and threaten messages have been some recovered all were post smart from Trenton New Jersey which meant that they had been process at the post and distribution center in uh actually near Hamilton Jewish or post marks September Eighteenth want address the Tom Brokaw NBC TV\nAnd another was sent to the editor of the New York post the other two letters for stamp October ninth and address the senators Thomas ... and Patrick Leahy so as people became infected in September October and November local responses revealed gaps in preparedness for biological attack for example the first confirmation of anthrax case was on October fourth\nIn\nMore than two weeks after the initial as her male so I mean we look at the retrospective assessments of all this and um\nWe we learn that nine people\nWere exposed to um the rice in African ... about the rising sorry the anthrax had already contract is the fear their illness previously had been missed identified because faulty diagnosis erroneous laboratory tests\nBut in the end the final result at the end or in the end twenty two people had become infected\nFive of whom died meanwhile they were buildings that were\nBelatedly found to be contaminated with anthrax spores and they leave from the letters or at least thirty thousand people who are deemed at risk required prophylactic antibiotics like ... and millions more fearful and many of them anxious about opening their own mail after that\nNow\nA lot of this information then I'm telling you right now about the anthrax attacks I'm sure many people have forgotten and there's a lot of stuff that after doing research I found out that I did not know about I I did not know there were plenty of other buildings that were leaking\nSome of this uh some of his uh you know biological a powder and uh the anthrax spores I had no idea\nAnd so\nThe seriousness of the rice and attack I Believe I'm you know warrants a lot of questions one is is this would this be considered the first assassination attempt on the president\nThe first known assassination attempt on the president [noise] and um [noise]\nWhen you look at all and we're being attacked was this done [noise] in order to slow down [noise] or the FBI or reports\nOn the Kavanaugh for case [noise]\nOrdered to leave the

I'm Wondering what's going on and and ah so I made my determination so Jones a PIN me and he said hey just tell me what this final blows give me what do you think it is and I said it's going to be a biological attack on the United states\nWhen it was bad agree I agree he says um and uh I think I'm going on the show again soon probably this will be a good follow up for that yelling and talking about this\nAh\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states I speculate on many different occasions that this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... ... in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo there there are preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talk to her again and function exercise is something that most people don't know about it and bring it to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson Maryland form of something and they released into the public\nIs test to see you know how people react to it sometimes they provide them with Anna does sometimes they see how many people checking the hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for\nThe CDC and others to to to monitor the moving the disease and some people don't support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently there's new TV show\nDoctors called New Amsterdam\nOr apparently that was a that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who ah gets Bola Andy brings it to the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow plague we talked about you know the situation that happened\nAh with the uh Emirates plane for other planes where uh you know there was um different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things are happening and uh it's all happening at once and they said this is a is is again of these again for sex or size\nAnd ah I said you know something is going to happen where are the real thing is going to go down and when it does you know we'll know that this the beginning is the beginning of the final bow that and so I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails that could be you\nKnow given through mosquitoes and said today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing\nBiological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice and\nWhere is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon\nAnd the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in announced that they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there is at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation ended up packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James Mattis as there was an address to James Mattis achiever naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president Ted Cruz's office they're released this statement\nThis is a statement from the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious and below ups that had been screamed at the Pentagon mail facility\nHe's envelopes are currently undergoing further testing and this is ongoing will have no further comment\nOn this show as Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed that Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open it contained white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that\nUh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison rice and\nAnd just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change the direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare\nAnd even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA you know biological markers that would do would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected\nIf you inhale it it's a you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four\nThe Russian each called here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nA in Dallas, Oregon and\nAh I think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way to um distract us from it\nAh there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time is that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge\nProbably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday they'll hand down their decision in the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to be happy I doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and Kevin I'm going to be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger with\nA lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice and so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that test an emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything this peculiar and\nUh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on ours Jonah show I talked about it at great length\nOn this program for a good long time and people with this program know lived on this people who\nLet's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact here because I remember we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger stepped down\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably lead retire die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy and one of my friends was really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard the we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome\nAnd there are several other times in instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students happen\nDamn close believe it or not we're damn close and\nSo we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if\nIt is just out of hand [noise] I'd say be prepared because if the work goes down tomorrow about cabinet and some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest in some of the major cities across the country [noise] so we have to prepare for that not that it will happen but\nRepair if it does happen [noise] truly fiction mystery thirty seven

[laughter]\nBut uh no I have a couple of different cause I'm I Do I like how you uh you know you always see these patterns and it is interesting we're right before that that called the more that that takes tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that I mean it's not anything is possible but is it possible that\nThis could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but could it be that actually\nThe right side the right wing so to speak yeah could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever\nAnd then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that they're targeting a course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right and then you have Ted Cruz which if you cruise Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to have Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the fall it anymore and\nThe other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of a a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee\nSo well I don't know if we're getting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\nSure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations ... but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do it for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was just work the investigation and devote the confirmation vote I think that it would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision\nAnd and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going to wrap

United States but what I find interesting is\nNo reporting of this on other major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the ah there was again a cabin on board\nIn fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about they were confronting of course the Mitch McConnell and others of course giving him the basis I mean like they do it's like you're not getting in the faces of the senators\nAnd basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rapist and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nYeah it totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows if he was responsible for these rice it and who knows what the motive is\nBut it just all sounds like it like like you said the Nineteen eighty four tempted thwarting a boat or changes says you're not a vote by the Russian each called in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four it's the same ammo\nIf the same purpose to somehow stall or otherwise uh for the efforts of either the

before nine eleven and a matter of fact that morning at nine eleven forty a fight our\nHead hunter reporter's stand outside a Democrat Senator name that guy ... ... and and the investigation under ... shouted lady\nRemember that yeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers\nAnd there was also getting a function they your but after the towers that story was that was God I didn't hear about it\nOr have you been to China levy yeah I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item into the the towers went down and then that everyone was like after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nWell I'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for\nWell I I yeah I Am but Gary wasn't planning on a or B being achieved justice [laughter] we're once again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know\nThey're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case would Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I just wanted to put that out there and I'll let you get to know the common good\nVery good point though very good comparison in history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it ... around here that you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ

two plus zero plus one plus eight at up to um eleven oh that's right and when was nine what was what was that date back in September\nAnd then I ... I went into it when I was one plus one add up to nine plus one plus one yep twelve nine oh what a loving sorry that's\nRight although nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right which is an eleven eleven yeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRyan Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an eerie quality to it in\n... you want if you want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon what\nI've what day was that September eleventh All right yeah\nI Would say just one thing but I was calling up about the rice and and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these are called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that's something else and it does\nSmack of of rice and poisoning and I'll just to be clear Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so I Know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where they're already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations\nAnd they're moving a shift to the ass off to see a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there and they're Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle\nCry will be confirmed\nYeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow would you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about cabinet and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by ...\nNow you have the ads not English relation CJ I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when I'm more ... than I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but now Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over and now well that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last\nWord because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized a political that nobody's going to have faith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago\nYou didn't really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not
