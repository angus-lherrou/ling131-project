[noise]\nIf you keep it tomorrow you bought it again and if you keep it the next day you bought it again every game keep something it's as if you made the decision to purchase it again for its current market value and there's nothing wrong with that\nAs long as you don't mind boggling it so let me give you an example if you if you and I both thought or if you thought gold was going to double in the next year and you had evidence to make you actually believe that\nWe're going to turn a hundred thousand and the two hundred thousand and one year and you all and you and I both believe that are just you believe that and we had a hundred thousand dollars cash sitting in the middle of the table and I said would you buy goldie Hawn crappy ass 'cause I can turn a hundred and the two hundred\nRight yeah but we're making the decision then not based on what we paid for it we're making the decision based on what we think it's going to do in the future\nOkay the decision to buy or sell or hold theirs is based on the future not the past [noise] other than we use the past to project our future but then when we do that with gold it tells us to sell\nYeah sell sell it take your last take your lumps you might have dumb investment you lost a bunch of money that stupid tax now you've got a pile of money in the military well what do you want to do with that money well modeled pals Morgan what the heck\nOkay therefore decisions are two different decisions are two different buckets to do ... proper critical thinking on this Jonah is in Dallas texas Hi Jonah how are you\nHey there how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a college student uh I have about ... between eight and ten thousand dollars a year is coming in that I don't have anything for with her for having um a merit scholarship so the ...

was in South America do I live there and I lived there in the middle of well it was a regret in the middle of his towards the end of their civil war was there the dirty war but it was more of a civil war I saw civil war and a whole new light it was different than me\nTwo sided civil war we have in the Eighteen hundreds it was or something else he was civil war in contemporary time it was it was civil war in a in a in a major city\nAnd when I say when Assad is I'm sure many of you think that it's just some backward city in South America no it's it's actually a south America's Spain or France or or or it it had the feel of Italy or France or or Spain or any of the European cities it's it's\nAn amazing city very urban very uh advance a lot of advanced technologies there because they try them out down there and see if they'll work down there they did they move up here sometimes it's the other way around\nAnd so the biggest concern\nFor a lot of Americans is what's going to happen to this country what what is going on\nAnd when you speak a bike civil upheaval in civil war and you say to yourself well it's not there yet I always hear people say why it's not there yet but I'm Wondering you know do they know did they ever lived through what do they know what it's like to live in one\nAnd\nI said to myself that maybe I waited too long to talk about the reality and and and how we're smack dab in the middle of a reality that is out of control\nI mean we have new laws and you have executive orders that pretty much been able to president\nThe act of emergency powers act I mean he could make plans any time to just\nArrest people you know and I've heard the rumors that that's probably in the works some sort of a\nArrest structure somehow they're going to go after they're just making the plans to see if they can legally go after people who have been creating problems in this country that would be a more or less involved with what I call this this this island or this or you know very soft coup\nOr there's the soft espionage or you know it's all it's all get soft espionage soft coup\nOther behaviors with or you know certain people and how uh you know they they try to say that it's a constitutional behavior when it's not I mean look\nI Know that if you say that if you say well maybe the president's planning on doing this he's planning on exposing all the way back to twenty sixteen some of the problems we had even during the Obama administration even before that the Bush administration\nOr a response to that would be well here we have political sour grapes\nThe political sour grapes get political splinter groups and with political splinter group should get the uh marginalizing fragmentation of our republic\n\nAnd believe it or not as the fragmentation of our republic that destroys us it will destroy us for sure\nAnd there will not be and there is not I repeat there is not a unanimous front\nAgainst an abusive government does unanimous front against ourselves\n\nAnd we're easily exploited\nEasily exploited by political Jagger not said have\nBeen hijacked by\nNeo cons anarchists socialist anti ... black lives or you go down the list\nOkay and the media basically\nAll of the American people like sheep and it being joy enters and what they're doing is they're basically encouraging what I call divisive colds\nAnd these groups do nothing to further the cause of change\nIt solve the entire process as it appears to be mired in nothing but fanaticism\n\nWere stuck in this Meyer a fanaticism it's beyond protest signs and pepper spraying people camping in parks or ... or pepper spraying the homeless or what the overall feeling here in America\nIs that it's wise to have a gun\nOr everybody's saying the gun violence\nShouldn't be curbed that you should you know revisited the second amendment there are many people who say that that are still\nWanting armed security and they think it's wise to be armed to have a gun concealed carry and you're feeling in the United states is if you're going to have at least\nA gun\nThen you should have at least some stored food batteries radios and you'll be come swallowed up into the onslaught of attacks and the homeland from an unseen enemy but the unseen enemy has been seen we're identifying the enemy all the time the enemy is within and the enemy is allowed and all of us\n\nBack or what was it um yes if you years ago\n\nActually show this program I says I think it's wise to know and and find out just to your neighbors are\n\nAnd I said you know maybe we shouldn't organizer neighborhoods on her own or the or else someone will come in and do it for us\nBecause the cloud that hangs over the United states now\nIs it no group is safe unless it's legally armed organized openly advocating a return of more localized government state constitution rules against the federal government run amok [noise] um\n\nI remember it was a civil war of the Eighteen hundreds that brought us the bloodiest conflict\nOn American soil and that was our first war veterans right there\nYou actually they were having Lincoln and Eighteen sixteen was the final straw for many southerners in an all eleven states or they were eleven states ... this this either from the union for these Virginia Arkansas and North Carolina and Tennessee did not succeed until after the battle for Sumpter that occurred on April twelve fifty sixty one five additional states were border slave states\nThey didn't succeed from the union Missouri Kentucky West Virginia Maryland in Delaware\n\nNow we're not talking about secession tonight I'm not even though there are a number of states\nSince ... basically it says they want it to you know form their own governments maybe like California's been what they want to separate the three states and and Texas has always been wanting to get out of the union and than they ever you know the constitution says they can\nBut Americans have been angry with government from from way back I mean when\nObama was president they wanted us to see now with Trump president they want us to say they want to but they say they want to move to Canada and all this other stuff but if he's not less just trivial path that they like to spread out there to make themselves look important\nBut\nA lot of this has to do with the you know the the the thought that uh it was a part in the declaration of independence\nI Want to jump to a historically an actor but I think it's um there's a I'm a part of the declaration events that says something is that governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends\nIt is the right of the people to alter abolish it and Institute a new government\nSo adding insult to injury [noise] um [noise]\nWe the people [noise]\nAre engaging [noise]\nIn some pretty bad stuff right now [noise] and uh [noise]\nCajoled and socially molded

Fox News hurricane Michael now a category three ... one I did twenty miles per hour forecasters warn it could strengthen the category for when it makes landfall Florida governor Rick Scott warning residents in the panhandle to be preparing to\nWhich group of both liberals and conservatives in this country than are borderline psychotic and resorted to screaming in ... at the door like animals or better yet like zombies trying to get into government buildings as British reading confirmations or voted upon\nSomebody called me and said well disingenuous recently the conservatives are doing it well no not really yes liberals are doing it more so we're seeing more of the liberals doing it because of the unpopular votes and the unpopular choices but they don't particularly like yet they are going psychotic\nBut there are some that are responding bitter justice psychotic\nThe uh those on the right there responding so yes everyone is driving a nail into the cockpit of America\nMore so one side than the other and seems actions that we're ... we're basically motivated by sheer emotional now been motivated by fearless rage is beyond emotion now it's all about right and this is getting dangerous and while it would be prudent to tell people\nThat perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one will listen because there are vendettas to be settled in revenge is a dish that his best serve cold in America\nYou whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad Clyde and then I fear mongering for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nThat is certainly cynics that are there in order to keep telling yourself in America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed and they're living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and it it's a real experience that I talked about that and the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern day at a modern city modernist city like when I ...\n\nI mean life was normal except for little things so it makes you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine that the United states a civil war would be similar except that we have the Internet that's the difference say\nMean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different\nTo the normal news cycle regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean he begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it's certainly send the ball rolling because there was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that\nTo members of Congress we\nWould have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks Seattle we have the rights that attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each cult an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon\nI mean either simple politically motivated attacks and these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if the response is overwhelming and police departments cannot keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nAnd the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working with an already militarized police or the police working against the military\n\nThere also be restrained to start with how or if if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I\nDon't know if that'll go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\nAnd the reason why we think this\nIs because we look back in history and we all know that it was the union believed to be in the less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\nLike Republican\nAgainst Democrat conserve against liberal no on how it's going to be\nThat's not what a civil war will be in the United states if this happens no it's not\nModern civil war would have many\nSo called side's seeing the dirty war South America there were several sides that we're fighting there were the parent is kind of nice there's the radicals radicalize the communist coming in east is the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews who until the police the moderate state in the plaza I can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\nThe age group would have their own band the terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture of course in government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to ... military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well your poll by the way was part of that group\nSeeing America we didn't have a left wing group inside violence or insurgency that what sparked a response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti far because they're usually\nThe ones that carry out all the stuff on this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick ... there was a black man who\nWas shot by police afterwards members of anti five blocks streets directing traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police looked on and allowed the harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAnd elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti ... what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob when they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turn instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the man was out numbered probably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing wrong\nAnd it could have wound up with him being beaten shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nYeah I had about

quiet people often ask what sets us apart from the competition it's easy with our problem and we know what my\nCivil war\nNo one wants to admit it but we are right now I Believe in a civil war\n\nAnd it's time to stop saying that it's not happening because it doesn't affect you directly it is happening the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs that two sides fighting against each other even though there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight but what\nWe're saying if somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's a patchwork of affiliated in surgery or insurgency groups and\nWe have counterparts engaging in fights in skirmishes along overlapping edges of other networks that are demanding your support your attention occasional ... and and this leads to occasional high value terror attacks windows terror attacks happened there turned into political radicalization points\nAbout things like gun control\n\nThings like immigration and it's not just that that were radicalized that were radicalized with TV shows Roseanne\nNext to remark immediately we we turn into a political football they bring back Murphy Brown it's a political

the war no they're not going to ask you to join the war that are going to ask you to pick a side because the war itself composing\n\nAnd the thing is if I say one thing we so obviously he thinks like this will know by saying that they're going to see things like that no I'm not taking any side I'm saying in general\nThis is what we're saying\nItself composing there's no official or to be called\nThe war is worth at all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything that doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identify the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identify it after the war and that's what historians do\n\nWhen you take a look at all of the things that we can say we're a little skirmishes and and little ideological a fight so we had Charlottesville\nBerkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here in my my city yeah it is just it's terrifying all fronts aren't territory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJustice regrets missing the signs of network violence thinking in terms of classic civil war can blind us\nTo the many actors working to disrupt the United states from within and beyond our borders we heard Carlos talking about the rough childhood the cirrhosis of the word world we got a benefactor's provocateurs Olive Garden plutocrats transnational credible criminal networks we have\nA Islam we have a border skirmishes where you have ever has Thirteen we ... I mean we have everybody\nWants to come here and disrupt the system this is why are you know we always hear about Russia provoking anger this is why George Soros is always the guy that's being said well he's funding move on funding all these other groups\n\nNow if you can think of all these characteristics if you think about how we're all breaking down into like these tribal segments and now they're fragmenting everything you can see that this is what a modern civil war looks like\nMore sporadic and unexpected conflicts but with fewer deaths factions\nProducts like mushrooms taking different forms but coordinated across invisible networks waves of information warfare\n\nOr seeing chaos that accelerated ... accelerated bizarre of violence in all kinds of I mean look\nWe have a healthy immune response obviously for the local and national authorities\nThe goal of the civil war is not death but the fragmentation of the republic the goal of the global assist or will America down to a manageable collective and this would even your heart and the resolve of an increasingly authoritarian world government and would provide more reason to implement smart city infrastructure in order to maintain full spectrum control\n\nWhen I said get ready for anything prepare for anything I wasn't kidding when I was an hour's Jones I said prepare for a war footing I'm not kidding I don't

in the northwest and she loves the Pacific northwest and this is something that she can't believe what's happening here\n\nAnd I thought it was just going to get worse because virtually every major institution right now in this country is being radicalized you're being reshaped by the radicalization of our public lives you could look at it the social media section you could look at it or you

do anything in their power to do it\n\nGo to Jack in California hijacked or on ground zero yes so right now we're in a conventional so or at least that you\nKnow it's an unconventional all it's a civil war this is how civil wars are fought in in modern times it's not about dying it's about fragmenting it's about I mean some people will die and some people have died because we've had these
