have and George to I think it should be a landmark it's kind of an interesting in fact while I was in Washington DC I plum forgot\nAbout seeing those steps when I was in Washington DC I mean now we're we'd have enough time I mean we were walking most of Washington DC is walking ... part it's like I'm\nSeeing you could drive the White House you drive to wash pneumonia we parked at the Washington Monument we walked all the way over\nTo the south side of the White House\nAnd we were there when the angle of Merkel just happened to be in town and so ah we were kind of I'm dealing with security at the time and so it slowed\nDown our process then is getting around and do things and so I didn't get a chance to see those steps but um they certainly are creepy and\nThey want to make him a landmark so certainly um you know we were on it [laughter] I mean Halloween and all we do we try and give you the best we can I mean it's ... it's basically the time of year\nWhere we find another excuse to party although I got on my partying out on the twenty seven kids Don costumes of course ah I\nWas really excited when Janine sent me a picture of Liam he is a he addressed EPA's tomato head from Fort Night he's got the mask and everything's got pizza suit it it's just really cool I saw his picture and uh yeah tomato head from Port night and um\nFor those of you that um have beggars the company or for candy that's another thing that a Halloween is all about it's certainly a tradition that had said\nI don't know Halloween is sending some mixed messages this year and what I mean by that is is I don't know if you've heard of this petition\nBut parents want to petition that Halloween be the the last Saturday of every October instead of the thirty first asked me last Saturday in October and what's interesting about that is is that I I think people to do that people are saying that you don't know that Halloween has\nTraditions that are wealthy bitter you know the date all the way back to you know the sixteen hundreds\nAnd Halloween of course the day before all saints day or the deal is one of those the day of the same day of the dead and so it's kind of like a tradition that the day before uh we pay respects to the dead the dead walked the earth and we pay attention to not only the spirit world\nBut also some of the darker genesis or the spirit world we we um we make jak letters to ward off evil spirits but of evil spirits you\nKnow they pass over our house we do we're supposed to that's what trick or treaters are supposed to be it's supposed to be the evil spirits if you don't give him treats they do tricks and that's why it's called tribute treating this year I just think that there were a lot of mixed messages being sent and it seemed to you know\nWe're living in times were where there's this devil does your hiding in every discussion dealing with politics and religion\nMiniature particular I I've had well I really late heavy on the devilish aspects of holiday because from a social studies perspective I think we've reached a time in history where we are definitely in the shadow what can we label be gotten anti Christ\nMeaning that you know even though people may not be able to identify the anti Christ or\nThe bitch that will barricade means in heat right now let's just put it this way I mean I I don't mean to mince words but it just seems to me the dog bit bursts the anti Christ the certainly in heat right now and and people are just waiting for this to having\nA\nLegend of the darkest one of all which is the anti Christ that came out of a desire\nTo better understand the last judgment and the science civically those been Harold the arrival of this tyrannical figure this this anti ... we were told to be vigilant we watching the science we're told in the Bible\nWatched the signs that they may warned of a coming of the ... days watched the signs they may be the warning the coming of the anti Christ to come and go to the the apostrophe\nOr many men fall to the to the ills of evil and scripture and ... cool commentary and never fully addresses a exactly who\n[noise] who is figure is who who would proceed the coming of Jesus I mean it's really an anomaly and and everyone who has a particular celebrity or politician they hate will often choose them to be the anti Christ especially the average have there\nBeen rolling the dice and say my bets on this guy by bets on this got my bets on Trump my bets on you know and you just go down the list I remember when Barack Obama was president many people thought that he was the anti Christ\nBut\nI I Would say that this study or\nOf a modern anti Christ is a truly hard sell for most people mainly because in a secular world and we're we are in in you know ... to them the anti Christ is simply a marketing term it's a it's a buzz word for for Christians who who\nSee that they are being persecuted in their fate is being destroyed by any number of groups and therefore we can save the devil is in them the devil's in them any Mimi mighty move the devils anew the devil is this group the devils backed group the devil is the right the devils the lab the devils everywhere\nDon't you know this but that was ever and this leads to\nNot conspiracy theory but the idea that a conspiracy exist a darker conspiracy exist but is here to bring down mankind\n\nAnd so when you look and conspiracy history you have to take into account biblical history has well this is something I mean I I think this gets confused sometimes when people say well when you're thinking of America you gotta figure the Christian values that America stands on well what it is is you need to look at the Christian conspiracy\nOr the conspiracy against Christianity because here we have this this you know this all out battle\nAgainst people in America we're fighting against the I mean and when you're looking conspiracy history it all has its roots in biblical overtures mentioned ritual as world events are not simply circumstantial\n\nBut they are the result of an organized campaign by an elite group of unseen in widely unknown world leaders\nAnd of course we pointed out that they have beliefs and agents symbolism\nSecret suicidal ... magic and that affects us any it's not about what I Believe it's about what they believe they're the ones in power and so if you say to me well you talk about this all the time you must believe it it's not about how how I Believe it or what I Believe\nI just don't which there and I know that\nCausal engineering and ritual magic effects everyone regardless of religious believes regardless of what you practice or what you say you're ... I mean these groups\nI mean these groups they um\nThey ah they answered other philosophy secretly and [noise]\nOutwardly they're using you know new wage used biblical symbolism and they use it to exercise absolute dictatorial control [noise]\nOver the world and they're trying to establish this new world order [noise]\nAnd they play on your beliefs relive what you would if you if you had to have you heard the ah the media lately they've been strategically changing [noise] what globalization means saying that well if you're saying that you know you're against global isn't that makes you an anti\nSemite will not does not [noise]\nSaying that you're not for global as a means you're not for a world order that is going to be led by obese system and certainly\nHas been part of privacy for a long time [noise]\nAnd so tonight the little beep or is that we're talking about the anti Christ you're talking about the empire of the dark dark wave approaching\nThe dark tsunami demons that we've been warned about [noise]\nBe prepared because we will be feeling the impact of this you know what I mean [noise]\nI'm quite Lewis you'll see the ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a saint that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nAre implying that they do not want their kids anywhere near this new technology\nThis article is called the dark consensus about screens in kids begins to emerge in Silicon valley Christian speech or a former social computing research you're married to a Facebook engineer has been secretly confessing that the devils seems to be doing his handiwork with technology and the targets are your children some of the people who\nBuilt video programs without horrified by how many places the child can now ... catch a video or watch a video of being a ...\nWorked as an executive assistant at Facebook and is now at ... a philanthropic ... said I Am convinced the devil lives at our phones is wreaking havoc on our children\n\nFrom the time we were children we were told we're not supposed to sit back close to the television does too close to the TV on blind you will it's now in the palm of your hands\nAnd the kids are mesmerized by what can be seen as a dangerous oracle that somehow has tremendous power over our children I Believe that people are now and cultural trends\nWe're being sent\nMessages that are triggering our tendency to be angry and violent and so this demonic spirit is being poured into the zeitgeist which is being fed not only by social media\nOr the increasing dark programming being unloaded into the pop culture [noise]\nTripoli six every three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six every three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nI'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nYour overhead door is going to go out when you least want it to there's never a good time but the worst times in the middle of the night but you've got the number overhead door company a bomber twenty four hour customer service residential commercial when you really need it\nFor all nine eight six six twenty five thirty five or better have 'em come out now check make sure everything's working right repair or replace and then not have to worry about overhead door company bought one for all nine eight six six twenty five thirty five\nNew gel NATO the man accused of killing eleven people end up Pittsburgh synagogue indicted by a federal grand jury today Robert\nPowers basis forty four counts including hate crimes attorney general Jeff Sessions will ultimately decide if ours will face the death penalty called the alleged crimes comprehensively evil according to the indictment Bowers was armed with three Gluck three fifty seven handguns and of course they are Fifteen rifle\nIn Pittsburgh David Lee Miller Fox News\nPresident Trump on a campaign blitz ahead of next Tuesday's midterm elections he was stumping in Florida Today for the first ever Lebanon stops he'll be making in the coming days Democrats breaking at some big names like former vice president Joe Biden at a rally in Illinois where to situation\nWhere a a the character of the country is on the\nFormer President Obama's stumps and the southeast friday\nThe ... or no one ran a new star five sixty Kaomi ah broadcasting from American standard bearer dot com studios\n[noise] the bad the eating right [noise]\nI'm not a written up man or a little bit him or when [noise] to me what he'll\nTell me one day my and\nMy friends [noise] we [noise]\nI Believe I Don future [laughter]\nNow burning less [laughter] when I [noise]\nOh\nWhen\nYou a\nWindow [noise] [noise] oh oh\nOh\n...
