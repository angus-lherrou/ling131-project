happens in life\nBoth the cross and the serpent were secret to the Jewish so they made the former by cutting off all the branches of an oak tree\nThey fashioned one of them to the main trunk in the form of the letter T\nSo it was a staff with across to the top illiterate tea and then on that open process they would put a snake\nAnd so this open across cut\nTo the tea with the snake represented the healing deity the biker gang\nAnd many of you know if you read anything in the Bible [noise] you're right about the fiery servants in the Bible and how Moses did the same you took what looked like a\nTea took it from a branch made it into a team put the snake on it and today\nWe have a similar type of symbol called the producers which you see that all the time in doctors' offices are on

all the bad blood and then you try to replace it with a good place and some people would have to be sacrificed in order to have a good blood and usually it was the elite there would drink the blood or eat at the heart or or any of those types of sacrifices that were known in the times of the drew even before that\n\nSo it's okay to cross with the snake coiled around it\nWas the healing simple you on that same symbol is the dollar symbol if you ever noticed that the dollar symbol is an ass with a line through it but what are you the originally was was each snake winding around the pole\nAnd that's how you got\nThe symbol for money another healing symbol because money they say he was a lot of hills but certainly it's the root of all evil and some say that that old staffer that can do this is the evil Mary making of doctors using the blood and the organs and all sorts of things for their own\nLittle rituals so you've got across and the serpent sacred to the roads\nCutting the branch

what and what what it's called final events\nAnd ah I read some of it was really intrigued by the ... the lead and whether or not new or any ties the vampires are we're ... or anything like that so I decided tonight it'd be great to have big Redfern on the program to talk about this and so Nick Redfern of course\nWorks full time as a writer lecture and journalists he writes about a wide range of unsolved mysteries big foot UFOs Loch Ness monster really encounters you've seen him on all of the shows are from ancient aliens to a lot of other special ... and I've even appeared on some of the

on tonight I'm like I said you know Nick this has been a long time coming to you know you've been very busy\nAnd uh I remember back when final events ah came out I I was turned on to the Collins elite where the calling ... group and uh the family goes all the way back to the engine druids and or\nThe um the the meeting you had with rabies Shay and how that all came about can you give us a little bit of a background of of what the ... the leader about and and why does the secret family secret society are so are are are tied to perhaps the empire lives in the we're ...\nAnd I've actually never heard that the man [laughter] I I\nActually don't know what the ... family is that\nThe Collins elite Collins family I've not heard of that oh you never heard of the callers now that you've heard of the cones lead right\nWell yeah I wrote about that but I'm a ... and any links with ... and I'm so\nOh you haven't you heard of aliens right what's that\nYou've heard of the ... were the ones that are ... are are ... you you're meeting with rabies Shay remembering your book you talk to ... and he was with new funding in Nebraska and he says something the effect that perhaps the aliens that have been released that or or mutilated cattle are probably tied to the column delete\nWell I mean well yeah but not in a ritual they stick by or anything like that\nOr how were they tied up\nWith a college late tight to\nYeah what what what was exactly the story with you and rabies Shay\nWell basically what it was a back in two thousand is seven\nWas looking for a new idea for a book and I thought about doing water on the ocean far east UFO landing case in England in his eye and say ha and the reason why I thought about doing it was you know I mean that in a number of books they read on the subjects already\nBut there was some interesting threads late suggesting\nThat ain't my pain like almost like an anti ultra type things sort of testing new technologies on the on the militia personnel on the base rather than a rail UFO London\nAnd it turns out that Dr Shay um it was I'm a former Nebraska and a direct ... and also appraised so he had you know it's sort of a unique background when you get to you and ate background is one of the founding director and the other one has a priest\nAnd I spoke to right just as a seven and he said yeah you know we kind of a ... day and age and they feel like if I have threatened us and stuff and I thought about doing the book on it\nBut when they get on the phone and he said well listen even more interesting story and might be interested in in so intrigued about it and that which we all make it better story I said well let's face and he said that\nThe guys in the government and the department of defense told him that the rental showcase was basically like a fabrication is holograms and mind altering technologies and whatever [noise] um he said that they were actually part of the program that was trying to or is it was
