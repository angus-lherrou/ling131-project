while they save up money pay cash to build a house on that when\nPeople do stuff like that that's fine but there's there you go about Seventy five eighty a hundred thousand dollar fifty thousand are mobile home and call that a good long term plan no it's not a good long term plan it goes down in value that simple\nAt a buddy of mine owns a huge mobile home operation and he's always give me a hard time would you do when I said well they won't make which we untrue out which we've got some that go up in value or ... when when I see that as an across the board thing you\nKnow I Will tell you this manufacturing housing is what they always call it one way or the other there's all kinds of manufactured housing sometimes that means mobile home\nSometimes that means the wall system for building a factory there stood 'em up and it basically looks like a stick built a house and so it's treated by the purchasing public like a traditional home\nWhatever you're buying why don't care what words you use to describe but the question you ask yourself is when I woke up in front of it do I say mobile home\nOr do I say house\nIf you walk up in front of it and you say how\nUgly house pretty house but it's a house\nRight then then that's going to go up in value in a mobile home with the wheels off sitting on a concrete foundation that looks all permanent still looks and feels like a mobile home when you walk into it\nAnd as long as people think it was that it's not a house it's not going to go up in value because that's how the market perceives it\nAnd that's what you've got to look at so whatever you're putting into that you're throwing that money away ... ...\nWhat do you think about living in a mobile home for a year to say for a down payment if you're doing that five thousand are mobile home dining room pike export and lived there for a year while I save up some money that's fine because you're just given up you know some of the five thousand dollars not turning not allowing fifty thousand on something that's now worth thirty\nWhere you get upside down and the thing um\nOr if you're talking about renting something that's what you want to do sure whatever wherever you want to rent okay rich cheap rent is cheap as you can rent because that means you can save more for your down payment James's in Lexington Hi James how are you\nHey I'm good thanks for taking my call sure

smart conference on DVD and scream it all go in the online storage Dave Ramsey dot com\n[noise] whether it's ... herself sections online at all I mean there are five yards are hardly\n\nThis outbreak and the fact that it was so surprising in my opinion is proof but diseases are evolving end at the FDA and the CDC or having a hard time keeping up with the evolution of diseases down I Would tell you that bacteria\nAntibiotic resistant bacteria is one of the biggest problems we're facing right now as a nation because many people are getting MRSA and other problems or a flesh eating disorders\nBut\nA warning went out\nAbout this increase in uh the AFL this acute for a class in my light is\n\nThis has been a significant increase since twenty Seventeen and a worrying perpetuation of a disease which there is little understanding they don't know where it's coming from and why it's happening all the cases that we're announcing the two have been confirmed and twenty two states\nUh surges baffled health officials who announced a change in the way the agency is counting cases they also wanted to raise awareness about the condition so the parents can seek medical care if their child develop symptoms and fill positions can quickly relay reports of the potential illness to the CDC\n\nBe increasing cases are started happening in twenty fourteen the CDC was tracking this\nBut every year since then usually in August or September the CDC is logging a spike of it a spike in this ... virus but it it's a ... the ... celebrating the spikes are significantly high right now\nAre back in twenty Seventeen the CDs the reported that a child died from this disorder instance officials have been able to or they haven't been able to determine how the disease spreads\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed too bitter anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's\nToo early to know whether the total of twenty team will surpass those in previous years but the data is showing a substantially larger number than in previous months this year so and and the bad thing is is there is no treatment for it\nLong term outcomes or a crap shoot\nAnd what happens is whatever this is you know and we were talking about things like equal and several lightest we are talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain and the nervous system this affects the nervous system\nEspecially with a specifically the spinal cord\nNeurological conditions like you to have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins and genetic disorders among the case is under investigation\n\nAre basically there are five reported to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks a health department spokesman said the Maryland's first case was reported September twenty first known cases have been reported Virginia or the district this year but there were three confirmed cases in Virginia and twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials\nUpset now we know that medical science is continually making rapid advances we've got new medications that treatments all these things are developed\nAnd they're introducing a rapid pace our water supply and demand I often come to play the possibility that pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always assured that the Maya the FDA or buy health organizations that our system for screening\nUh is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are vaccine screenings are superior than most\nBut now can be argued that I after Jay consequences they're not necessarily the problem with a doctor but it may just be the the manufacture of these medications or\nWhatever it is re introduced into the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs are toxic environment vaccines kids are reacting to him in various ways I don't think the CDC or the FBI or anyone would come forward and say that perhaps the vaccine caused this\nOr some other drug\nI mean we know our biological systems are constantly evolving and if we go by scientific hypothesis we can also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills they kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case ... viruses that cannot be\nAltered\nAnd like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems both disease causing organisms and and of course the victims of people they all they they evolve and they adapt sometimes they've all been adapt or\nCertain diseases don't bother anymore they run its course it's kind of like a virus that runs its course it doesn't say it goes dormant for a while and that comes back with a vengeance but right now\nWe need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\n\nIn how we treat disease I mean the evolution of disease causing organisms they outpaced our ability to invent new treatments and it may even al pays for I Believe the ease pain and suffering\n\nAnd I can tell you that it it appears\nThe failures of the passive given wait for the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate raising him disease and biologically altered diseases as well\n\nNew problems of course of ribs in\nAnd out of this new paralyzing disease is harming our children\nAnd we know the accidents\nRelated to carry medication in particular multiplied\nAnd we begin to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\nWe hear about it\nVersus effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says I didn't know you were to anti bacterial they start ridiculing you\nBut just think about all the accidents at all the mistakes have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and do the vote with the ... would be a diseases that are coming of or now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call Ian aspects and for the for the eliminating a flock but you're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not helpless to a new new things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we have available many things that they can put us uh in in a situation where we can build our immune systems we can build or we can build all sorts of things that we just know\nThe right things to eat the right things to do is write supplements to take the right drugs I mean\nI I worry now because uh I heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about mosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them you know equine except for white is or giving them some sort of a eastern equine suffer why it is for some other a disease that affects the\nSpinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\n\nAlthough we are right now\nAt the doorstep of the new flu season and I would hate to think that the virus would attack a child and give them an ... virus a polio and non polio and Charles virus to paralyze them\nAnd so a word of warning that it just seems to me the diseases are\nEvolving now whether we're giving them the point where whether or not we're giving them the push is another story whether or not environment is giving them the push is another story whether or not drugs or after Jenike artifacts or things of that nature pushing it but it just seems to be more and more\n\nA\nBit of saying that polio is not the cause of it\nBecause of the CDC has tested every single stool specimens from patients and none of tested positive for polio\n\nUm West Nile virus is not causing that big of a rule that ruled out west Nile\nUm but there is some virus that starts out as the respiratory illness so we have this respiratory illnesses sets in so it's like having the flu and\nThen suddenly you start noticing that your children cannot control their arms and legs\n\nAnd so they don't have a pathogen identified yet it's consistently being detected\nInpatient spinal fluid with regard to FM so\nIt all goes back to the same old same old idea of washing the hands staying up to a you know you just basically wash their hands using insect repellent is this is the thing that's interesting they were saying you must you'd order to prevent this we we suggest that you use mosquito repellent\n\nSo what does it tell you [laughter] where where does that tell you it tells you that this is this is probably being spread by mosquitoes the very thing that we said we'd be responsible for a biological attack on the country or one of the very few things will be used for again a function exercise would be mosquitoes\nA Bill Gates released mosquitoes one time in a in a meeting that he had a Ted Talk to demonstrate how mosquitoes are more dangerous than sharks\nAnd so once again it's the idea that you know we're we're in the middle of it evolving if\nIt's the balding pap legitimacy to balding diseases so balding or evolving drugs and and having to having to prevent things but we have to have well I called prophylactic for protection\nWhat you mean to protect us from the beginning of protect your children from the beginning from what it is it's coming and it's just something that most certainly wouldn't want your children to go through [noise]\nDribbling fix every three thirty seven hundred that's trouble eat six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nAre we watching the evolution of diseases\nAnd is the pharmaceutical companies are are the pharmaceutical companies evolving with those diseases\nI don't believe they are [noise]\nI think that they are at a loss for a lot of things eighty thousand people dead from the flu last year I think is proof of that [noise] dribble eat six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred I'm

drink plenty of like we are in\nI'm white Louis [noise] you're listening to ground zero that it was called and I believe six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise] the pharmaceutical companies are not keeping up with the evolution of diseases\nAnd they're not keeping up with pain and how pain is evolving as well so what they've done is their teaming up with advertising agencies they're reading public service announcements and they're and they're basically\nCertain attitudes ideas about vaccines and drugs now selling that you you know he is trying to outsell\nTrying out sell your ability to heal yourself and the reason why is because I think as we speculated last year ... bio labs have greeted these new superbug superbug super diseases evolve into something else we have a respiratory viruses now turning into an ... virus\nWe have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\nOkay\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous evolution we're going to an evolutionary period that only for health but for the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd much has been written about how you do pharmaceutical companies will need to change and how they are offering the public uh\nIneffective drugs ineffective vaccines in effect the ineffective I after genetic artifacts basically where the cure kills you know CBO effects instead of placebo which do see boats no benefit at all\nAnd so this is why I I think it's important we should talk about this we\nShould bring this up because I I think that a word of warning should go out\n\nIf you have you ever have you ever compromised immune system\nI Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think ... vaccine is for everyone but after what I read about what happened last year and how people who've gotten the flu vaccine eventually had a flu that evolved into something else\nI'd be really really really suspicious of this because you can't sue the pharmaceutical company Brock Obama put that the law says Baxter International course was one of his major contributors and back through international course makes the flu vaccine several other vaccines\nOf course we're being pimped in pushed on the American people for the longest time\n\nNow here we are with everything they tell us get your vaccine get does get ... get busy and nothing's working\nNothing on our children are now getting ... viruses non polio internal viruses where they first start out as a respiratory illness and then they're paralyzed same thing with the sample items you start getting a ceiling effect this isn't your parent wants me to gain a function exercises where people are getting rice in sent to them\nWhere they end up getting sick and and they end up uh you know it's like\nWe're we're in the middle of this right now we don't even realize it's happening but the CDC says well this is happening we don't know what to do but will tell you about to watch your kids to make sure they don't take up the symptoms and get them an owned by the way the way to prevent it put on something put on some sort of a mosquito repellent so they don't get bitten by mosquitoes\nThat just speaks volumes to everybody shouldn't and especially when we talked about this before and how it's being done\n\nThe mainstream is not going to report this to you they're just not I\nMean they'll report it probably eventually but then I can report or like we're reporting it and they haven't been following it since we've been following the Kleenex exercise from the beginning to what has been happening and slowly but surely the game to function exercise viewed everybody's sick or to get in a certain group of people sick\nAnd the idea that using DNA from these twenty three Indian ancestry to sell to places like GlaxoSmithKline Pfizer\nSo they can use DNA to basically zero in on certain DNA ties for diseases\nBy like last year's flu eighty thousand people dead and we were discussing how he just seemed to me this is a flu that was going around with the ball be mutating into something a lot worse

on the TV show\nOr said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose or what why are they\nDoing off her twice sex for you I answer a fool according to his father\nYou know people are so silly ... it's just ridiculous how we had this idea\nThat the world ... judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to cap dispersion on others or whatever their behavior is acting human body is hard wired the substances as hard wired especially it'd be an ... substance that are already inherent in it and that's opiates are\nThey are analog bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take it okay to say that you have you have to pay ... an opiate hell with neatly happen is your ... your brain was down regulate\nThe production of its own and dodging it ... and you will in Athens become decision by taking artificial opiates you'll end up in the ... which will put you in a deficit day and there's a there's a ... fry it and you almost impossible to read it\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a a psycho social context surrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farm Mr pharmacist relationship\nBut yeah I I think people that tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you become pretty much uh\n... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that you're award you're awarded the state\nYeah you belong to say you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what are you going to you're hooked on August ... you you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the armistice even if even if it means Dr pharmacist shopping you\nYou're compelled to become to be a part of the model of the paradigm once you get on a city that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs too by the way that people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth I you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile\nAnd it was interesting because ah I was talking about he was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin\nAnd uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies\nSaying to me that they were addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the they worry about that that that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa who have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen maybe more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy\nCalled me and said I was in a motorcycle crash and I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and one day they just decided we were going to give it to me anymore\nAnd so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you know and and I never thought because I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications but you but doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation it's just absolutely terrible situation as you are talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive\nYou know you have a unique way of of of talking about what big pharmaceuticals argue said that when you were you actually did a time as a a a lick 'em in and send them pharmacist\nLike count for lichens that count\nPoorly can stick pharmacist you've spent some time there and you said you felt bad because what you were dealing with poison it that's what you said it's poison and see that's the thing is that it doesn't matter I mean we we have such horrible\nA what we say we you know we have such horrible ways of of talking about certain I guess it's a degree of penalty with drugs if you take\nA if you take a pain pill that's okay if you if you take heroin your bad or if you smoke marijuana your bad but they're all they're all there for a reason right\nThat happen a quiet that some drugs became good in other drugs he came back I mean well how did that hurt by another exactly for example marijuana how many people are in jail now because of marijuana\nBut now or or jail today 'cause they were selling marijuana five ... years ago but today it's OK today in Colorado you can just you can buy marijuana just walk off the street by marijuana\nSee what ... what gets me is that there is also people that are uneducated about what is legal what is it legal now with the use of cannabis of course the cat it was a schedule one and a lot of states federally but ah they have now are pretty much said that uh things like CBD oils and I think is derived from hemp are not illegal and they can be use\nAs well how how this prohibition where a quiet it don't work you know it's obvious it doesn't work it never works\nYou want to do drugs what is this ... of the government to create a a police state around people desire to intoxicated himself you know animals like when talking himself monkeys of alcohol I Love alcohol ... earth was ... or ...\nEven ... and she was a marijuana plant is adamant loved to change their reality actually considered by some people some research scientist to me a dry\nWell now now they want to bring back ... D for certain types of uh the depression so\nThe repeat the at the end mushrooms for people who are dying of cancer\nRight yeah I I I don't understand like I said the propaganda machines in the United states\nAlways seem to find a way to create a some sort of scenario where propaganda feed but they're telling people for the certain drug or use it gets a moral failing to use this drug it's a moral failure if you're addicted is moral failings and this is why we get people turning to harder drugs have nothing to do with gateway drugs has everything to do with well I'm not getting the satisfaction both physically and\nExistential and so therefore I'm going to be used by Bobby until I reached that would mean squared by that time you get too much when you die remember called eight seven seven eight seven seven four zero to\nGround zero for like dot com fried\nPlease I'm Carmen Robert secretary of state Mike Pompeo on his way from Saudi Arabia to turkey has yours applied diplomatic pressure to find out what happened a journalist Jamal ...\nThe question now is just how hard would private incompetent willing to punish them out if if they are indeed response of all President Trump prove that he was perfectly capable to punish turkey for some of the American pastor Andrew ...\nFisher catastrophic flooding collapse as a bridge in central Texas longtime resident and Lana say they'd never seen a lot of the time\nIt is nearly ... graves massive wave almost looks like this is I Know not a river\nJacqueline ... seven and Austin and that got millions draws us winning numbers that jackpot six hundred and sixty seven million dollars to third largest in us history is is\n[noise] [noise]\nNo one ran a new star five sixty Kaomi ah broadcasting from American standard bearer dot com studios\nEspecially damaging to the young people on whom our future depends\nWandering the\nAnd a half\nAnd I'm a younger audience the Ayatollah Khomeini accessible than I was born in rock size family ... younger audience only comply\n[noise] why why why\nWhy why you're overweight [noise]\n\n\n\n\nI'm I'm living with my\nMom is is that one [laughter] [noise] [noise] that makes for a Batman [noise]\nI don't know that for some [noise]\n\n\nOatmeal\nFor too long\nDrive a mini van [noise] but I can let loose with all due\nTo use heroin or heroin feeling rounding heroin on the market you can get some gang and get to learn heroin maritime academy I'm proud of the ... for me\nLike heroin am combined heroines with five milligram\nCaffeine high on cocaine\nHeroin\nFast [noise]\nI'm like oh it's [noise] you are listening to ground zero been through the tonight [noise] some value pharmacies send a very knowledgeable about what's going on some of the strange things happening is this a polio disease the\nKids are getting and other wondering where that's kept CDC is like the site itself they killed off Roseanne\nTonight on Roseanne giving her an opioid overdose it seems like once again we're looking at\nOpioid addiction is a moral failing and they put that on TV and so what better way to pick back roads or do you think band that people do you think they're doing is they're telling the wanting to do this for a an agenda I mean I Know the opioids are not a good thing\nTo be a dependent on but it just seems to me that you we just today they were actually uh I was funny I turned into H.

country for a year to take the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually trying to try and saturate his staff civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War or the ... are they a lot of Mexicans started to come over here in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and uh this is around the time of alcohol prohibition and uh the government got his great idea to\nUh to uh to prohibit\nMarijuana along with alcohol nobody really complain about marijuana because nobody really knew what Marilyn marijuana was back then but uh they made up they created in the ... campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny on covering for Madison talked about all this stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is ask cringe when they called the marijuana tax that which I don't know if you heard of that a\nMarijuana tax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nThey put a tax on marijuana and they sat and declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely nay marijuana is legal and it's been a legal ever said but the fact of the matter is is that\nPeople have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our ... our jails are\nHell with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least a police state around the around people\nAre just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana or psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol but we know that marijuana clubs I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are mostly on conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and I was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult to actually a deal with a lot it every day the the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something\nAnd I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not gonna and he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they've ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a using a can of a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs in this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis not with jail time in and punishment they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where\nThey put them in the hospital and they have to be treated and and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and a and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better or a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but that they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... they are in need of medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities are for specialized treatments\nAnd I think that the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack\nOr uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest\nThat would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because the problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said in the beginning\nBut it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain\nThat it's felt physically but it's pain that is spelled you could call on a conscious level or or your consciousness is in pain are wracked with pain\nAl ... don't work on that I hey they do\nDoes it there
