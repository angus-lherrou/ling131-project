said I'm a young entrepreneur and right there that mindset is already going to set you up for success you already see yourself in a space that just screams confidence and I love that I Will tell you one of the great things a million I see this a lot\nIs you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on this this is something that you could have a side business and start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills\nBut then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be your full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he started a little T shirt business Dave in college little T shirt business that was a multi million dollar business before he ever graduated and that was his full time thing so I mean you can do this I just want to encourage him\nThe idea that it's difficult to get into space because you're a girl I think\nIs more in your head than in reality if you build great pieces people want to buy them if you solve problems for people if you had a great product and you take care of the marketplace they don't really care if it was you or do some old someone young they just love the furniture\nI I'm I'm an older doesn't buy furniture but my wife went through a decorator and I can just tell you either my wife or I were we buy a piece of custom made furniture made by a lady that would actually be a brand that advantage 'cause we would think that was pretty cool\nYeah that you had that you have a good eye for it that there's yeah I think a million that you this does it have to be a barrier for you if you want to get so I think it's an advantage just you just get started because you're going to get the most confidence when you sell that first piece even if it's small piece even if you sell it to your aunt I don't care\nJust to get started dip your toe in the water and million will make sure that Kelly since my book and you can follow that plan at the step by step plan to grow this business and start small start on the sly side and you'll see your confidence growing up promised you a ... that will be a non issue it won't even be a fear in your head anymore because like Dave said you'll start to see it as an advantage\nThat you all for the marketplace through your business that excited for you the fact that you're even asking this question and making that phone call girl you got big things ahead for you I'm so excited for you\nSo let me tell you what happened to me a million when I went broke and I wrote a book about how to handle money I'm a broke a show on a book about money\nThat's kind of a disadvantage and all\nUs who would want to read a money book from a guy that went broke that's what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million bucks I kinda figured out everybody wants to buy a money book from a guy who went broke and learned his lesson\nAnd so it actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity\nThat felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brand differentiate or because I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirt you've got a brand new advantages you've got the female touch\nOn the furniture um and you're going to put a different kind of look a different kind of feel to it\nAnd uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture it's really cool you know it makes you stand out I just love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures\nWith you with your power tools and yet somehow get in there with the ... or whatever and safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... opposite of a disadvantage but when I started\nMy in security I thought was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right\nIt's interesting to we just had on her leadership master series last week and I was on a panel with Sudan fenced in secret than ... a very common theme we heard a in the audience asking questions is how ... women leaders women leader now you know how do I succeed as a woman in a man's industry\nAnd there are certainly some industries where you need to be aware of what you're going into but the reality is so often\nIt is bigger in our head than it is in reality it to your point if the thing we think is holding us back when that's the thing that's going to set us apart and make people want to buy from us and so I I Love the whole perspective Amelia uh that that you already see yourself as an entrepreneur now you just need to see yourself as a successful business owner and starts picked us up\nWell I mean I think about somebody like um you know where Condi Rice speak at the ... and I got to spend time with her obviously female obviously African American obviously super brilliant oh you got smarter to ... oh yeah with a woman it's unbelievably smart [noise] but um I mean\n... successful I mean ... ... United States of America I mean you know this is no small job here yeah ... and\nBut what ended up happening with her what what we we were asking her about the same thing the barriers you know the racial barrier the sexism racism all this kind of stuff and she used the line from her neighborhood\nShould growing up in a segregated neighborhoods in Birmingham, Alabama that her mom I told her it doesn't matter where you're coming from it matters where you're going Mm that's good ... and she said I don't let other people with their prejudice beside\nMy fate yep I decided my foot ... and ... it was like coming out it was just very calm but yeah I heard a loud and clear confidence in their ... but again it comes back to that that um you know you're going to I'm going to own a space and I'm going to turn what you think is a\nDisadvantage that race sex whatever it is up into an advantage because it's Brenda average raider\nOh I Love how you've been talked about you and sharing buying furniture if you look at most American household the women make the purchasing designing decorating decision\nOf what I think of a a woman that makes plans she's known in the spaces at creating furniture and plans and all white and I buy her plant like bunk bed plans or a fork in the backyard plans\nAnd I love hers more because she has that female touch via email designed so far at least you think should only in my mind I got you got you connected we're best friends you know to me so a reliable will draw those people based on that she didn't even realize it\nYeah that's that's very very important I think this is good information the book is business boutique it as a number one bestseller and you can see why Christie ride is with us the founder of that you hear her speak all over America and teach and you'll see around media you'll\nSee her a business ... dot com and those of you that are members of the uh business boutique academy regularly get coaching from her uh and of course now the crusty right business podcast yes very well right\nIt is it is taken off and it's amazing how when you can encourage people and inspire them and teach them while they're living their lives so like lift her starting on the radio show they may be driving in the car on a commute they may be going for a run or they may be cooking or cleaning or something around the house that you're able to encourage them and give them\nA the steps and plans and tools that they need to win so it's been really fun to to see the stories coming out of someone that their life has changed from the podcast\nWell the information is important because promotions what changes your life um you don't you don't you know you can listen to music and if you're if for those of you in the car all day I mean if you listen to the same if you listen to him all the time you get the same song\nAbout over what the hour and a half or so now put the thing I'll look and I like the music I enjoy that I enjoy talk radio in general but to have something like a podcast where I can absolutely decide okay I'm doing a leadership thing on this Ron\nI'm more than about Russia or I'm going to do a marriage thing I'm trying to learn about marriage and you can just download the podcast is just information intentionally going into my life and the my body and then my brain into ... changes everything\nThe new gold flowers out the business boutique twenty Nineteen gold planner on sale now it ships November the first ... jacket out Christie thanks for stopping by thanks for having me got to be here for the right business Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nHey it's Kelly Daniel associate producer infant trainer for Dave Ramsey show [noise] did you notice it in two thousand Seventeen Dave Ramsey show listeners paid off fifty million dollars in debt that's pretty impressive and it could be you this year listening for inspiration\n[noise]\nYou're struggling with money relationships career you name it you're stuck and you don't know what to do\nWell I've got great news for the first time ever or you can experience our Ramsey smart conference from the comfort of your home that's why you can now purchase our most popular live a ban on DVD and stream it on the go for only thirty nine Ninety nine in our own lawn store at Dave Ramsey dot com you'll get four and a half\nHours of life changing talks and two complimentary work books this brand new love of an experience was led by me and world class communicators including Dr Henry Cloud Dr less parrot Dr ... maker Chris Hogan Rachel cruise Christie right Anthony O'Neill\nThese folks are America's leading experts in money leadership personal develop my career parenting in marriage take back\nThe key areas of your life get our brand new Ramsey smart conference on DVD and stream it all go in the online storage Dave Ramsey dot com\n[noise] whether in sports for a selfie sexes online and on the air news on five sixty five ... and I hardly\n\nReady to admitted nine ... Fox News reports about the fate of missing Saudi journalist Yamanaka showed\nGear now multiple reports the Saudi Government is putting together an explanation to acknowledge that ... was killed during an interrogation that went wrong and that the real intent was to a doctor show and bring him back to Saudi Arabia\n... show was about ready to drop the records and uh I I was talking about the deep state\nOf the things that bothers me about the state is that it's it's the most overused term since false flag\nA because well because of shows like Alex Jones but because of uh what people say and what they think they'd be like a a big big like a false flag it's\nI didn't really happen so it's a false flag that's not a false flag okay and I've always felt so people tell people I Know that's a false flag but of course you know a lot of ignorance is bred when people tend to think that one thing means another thing and and they ... the people are defining their own terms\nYou know they're they're defining what is a conservative they are defining what is the liberal people don't even know anymore and they really don't ... and and they don't know what a you know critical analysis that are objectivity anymore because if somebody says one day\nThat he can't stand you know Donald Trump being a noxious because he is he's obnoxious there's no doubt in my mind he's he's he's obnoxious his obviously is obnoxious okay so he's not noxious president you say so that was going out and while as the Emmys liberal well come on\nEven if you're conservative you have to admit sees help noxious if if you if you can't you're you're not being genuine you're not being being disingenuous\nAnd you know if you're if you're like saying if you can't say that Hillary Clinton is obnoxious\n... your your disingenuous because she is obnoxious she's up noxious Donald Trump's obnoxious but the only difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is president the United states and he was voted in by the people that's the difference okay and as your obnoxious president\nWe're supposed to ah criticized him for things that he does wrong and we do a same with ... says the same about Barack Obama and people say I like Morocco bother\nThe and I said look you know bronco bombers our president and um we should try to give him some time given the honeymoon that he deserves but you know we didn't give Donald Trump the honeymoon for sure [laughter] [laughter] no [laughter] hey\nNobody gave him an ... a honeymoon and a and one of the things that's interesting is that you\nKnow between the false flag a you know nomenclature being bastard dies the other was the other was the deep state because they think it's an invention of Donald Trump and it's not\nIn fact the deep state was a shadow government one time there is also a the dark state there's also a what is it a dark command there there are several names for the state it's just a deep state stuck with Donald Trump and what's most troubling about this accusations that certainly the tactic being used as somehow discredit conspiracy theorists\nAnd others in the media feels are right wing extremist pushing the ever present persecution complex of the president listen uh let me just tell you this\nBack when the Democrats were in power there's a vast right wing conspiracy now uh now that the ... the Republicans are in power there's\nLeft wing conspiracy so is it or or no it's just there's a conspiracy and what it is is that it's it's meddling from the deep state operatives all over the world not just here in the United states not just Russia it's all over the world is these deep state\nPlayers they wanted to come in and undermine this country and they undermine that by by programming a weirdos to actually go on to Facebook pages and start declaring that a certain person is a certain type of a leading towards a certain type of ideology in in politics which isn't the case because when you are doing a conspiracy\nAnalysis of geopolitical players\nYou can talk about anybody and say what they do is good or bad and there's always somebody there they will tell you well obviously this is how you think all the time no it's not and so when you're looking at the deep state it's it's not an American\nDelusion ... if it's not you know is it is a worldwide phenomenon K\nThey didn't stay on a global level right now is needed in order for the elites to salvage what they called the liberal international order which pure and simple as new speak for new world order liberal conservative whatever it might be it is a new world order and it's being established now conspiracies definitely trying to overthrow\n... and they tried to overthrow many presidents including Brock Obama so they're overthrowing bronco bothering him or you know overthrowing George Bush or in fact they successfully a I think uh they they successfully were able to a command and also a puppet George W. Bush when he was in power it's obviously did that\nAnd a bronco bottom of the same they were able to ... him as well they puff it at a mall or the only difference between them and Donald Trump is Donald Trump stubborn Donald Trump stubborn and he doesn't know how to play the game of ah you know the deep state politics which is a dangerous thing for him and he doesn't care\nBut what I worry about it as if he doesn't care how does that fair with the American people and what would the deep state do to try and change all this while we've seen what they do they they mail rice and out to a out to people to scare them\nThey uh they they go in and they they do these are classic kids you know of a of a noted officials they kill people involved with a certain insight into ideology they that's how it works sixteen states in control so whenever you say about politics however I lean left writer or upside down I don't care\nI Know that there is something above it all there is a sin are above it all that certainly is controlling this country and it's trying to control the world so all we're arguing various ah you know or are getting a over various ideologies that we don't like or that we're thinking we're leaning towards you know the conspiracy is there\nTo metal in the affairs of nations all over the world that are struggling to keep their sovereignty\nAnd this is why there are few oligarchy\nOr willing to buy up in support chaos in the world and this is why we're now seeing in our major cities gang violence mob takeover and radicalized factions within separate strongholds and we're also seeing this on the Internet as well where people\nCan't help themselves but to try and be mean to one another because somebody has a different ideologies and they do\nInstead of being a little bit more open a little bit more willing to talk things out see the warning of a major collapse the United states is not being heated and it's going on right now because there are many of the radicalized factions and they're quick to blame each other for the problems in the country are not the bad actors on the world stage that wish to see American cities burn\nAnd that's where they want to do they want to see American cities burn the truth is there are many Americans that have been touched by the secret hyper power who wants to further the clutching covered as seizing of world controls against the wishes of the majority\nThe psychological damage has been done to this country\nWill take a generation or more to change and that if you're a people will stop and realize they've all been victims of massive know cis brainwashing propaganda it's allowing for raw emotion to get in a way of ultimate truth\nIt gets in a way of friendships in family uh relationships it's dividing marriages it's dividing man and woman is that if it's dividing political allies it's dividing it all\nThe deep state has always been\nA refuge for rogue intelligence operators\nThat worked for many of the countries that we have said that we said that are they they are our allies we said these are these we allied with these people but yet they're rogue intelligence ops that work within our allies the groups that say that they were friends look they've succeeded in developing ways the heightened suggest abilities subservient in the world\nAnd with the failure of the fourth estate\nAnd it controls that are now in place has been crucial in creating a warm climate politically motivated violence politically correct speech political dismissive talking points political

especially when I've said many times on this program I said you know and and I I'll say it again or politics or theater for the ugly because most things\nWhen they talk when you're talking parrot political which is a difference of just being clean up political what you're showing you just showing the ink and grew and grew into the inconsistencies of what politics are doing right now and then sometimes you'll say well what Donald Trump is doing is really kind of silly or what\nWhat's going on now is you know as I said the other night I said you know what Donald Trump spoke to a bunch of clergy man and he said here's the deal if we don't get the Senate there's going to be violence\nOkay and then Hillary Clinton goes well I'm not going to be civil and you don't have to be civil to a government doesn't represent our values so basically what we got here is we're going to war of words where like I said no longer is terror or or or no longer are terrorists the thing we worry about\nWe have to worry about now our fellow countrymen and whether or not our fellow countrymen are gonna rise up against us and this is a product of what we're in the middle of now ... take it at least Eighteen years or Seventeen years to foment\nAnd and it just seems to me that uh when all of this happened the open and then there's some our future with war rumors of war and all of this we're we're actually contributors to the division we're having now and the idea that people feel like well one side this way one side the other way and I'm not going to play either side nor am I going to\nHave some critical analysis of what I what each side is saying and each side basically are destroying the other and and no one knows why it's like it's like some sort of a pathological or or or schizophrenia type of attitudes people have now\nYeah they got you started to go out in public places where the ball's writing it was like I don't want to go out somewhere in the ... right after or something like I say oh it's much like I just don't want to get any of that\nWell you you get to a point though when you're a you're in the middle of it that you have to go places you can't just\nUh you know shopping your apartment and say\nI Can't go anywhere I mean you have to go shopping you have to go to work you have to do all the things you do but sometimes you just be in the wrong place at the wrong time you'd be in the middle of a riot a shoot out\nSomething that's going to be a indicative of this this this instability we have between each other and are you just have to kind of play along with it and say well got a point in my day around something else like when I was your Saturday I was working on a project on my own in my office get a phone call from my boss saying there's going to be a huge a get together between patriot prayer\nAnd anti ... run patents here he went out in the middle of it I had to write a show I did a show\nAnd I had to talk about it but as we were watching it unfold right from her\nOffice it was a little terrifying to see the people start beating up on each other and and this is what we have brawls or the middle of the street every day especially we have mayors the don't do anything and governors who do nothing continue to allow the corruption continue we need to be stronger against this type of fighting it's not freedom of speech it's it's it's\nDomestic terrorism is what it is\nIt that they didn't they meant\nThat you just don't yeah I mean if you're if you're basically creating violent scenario or creating dangerous places in your city for a political goal that's terrorism so no we don't have Middle Eastern terrorism we have the terrorism that's being vulgar than here in our in our homes because of deep said operatives on a world level\nAnd to not having to prove there's deep state operatives on world I'm not just some delusion not some right wing conspiracy outright thing this is this is amazing transformation is

the fact that uh they needed someone to go wall to wall and I'm not complaining because I I Want to be in on the ah I Want to be in on the secrets I Want to know about the big things that are being planned I Want to know\n'em I Want to know who's involved and why and so I brought up this book called possess the devils it's a book that was written by a ...\nAnd uh it was pre revolutionary or if it were at the details that the middle class society would be destroyed through a crackdown on dissent\nDenial is expected to revolt in a way to the time where the people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain\nThe Nile is expected some sort of revolt so they awaited the time whether people would rise to the occasion and give the\nPower structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain basically giving the power structure heartening to resolve the power structure to literally come in and clean house\n\nYou know began and does the U.S he's book and began with the silencing of the people the silencing of those people who are putting forth to the fired state\nPower that would happen you know they went and they shut down they shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down or you know journalists silencing people their free speech the freedom of the press everything taken from them and little by little information became scarce and the result was a\nFerocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city\nThen came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war\nWhere young people were sacrificed in order to empower the leaders were the blood bond where the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly adapt to intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a\nOf a you know group said to are supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists and and then we have the anti fascist and the left wing umbrella of its shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side of the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nAnd everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not you can say that doing this\nDividing and fighting his anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for the media and the center except that is why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the hour they never say who they are I've never I mean maybe I can find some place by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken up by the media\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in anti ... but there's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to remember that there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the warring groups of the city's literally\nAdapting this blood Samantha back in time in Germany and Hitler was blue kites they called the blue the kite balloons kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accent of murder and violence and the others would follow suit\n\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue type going on\n\nIn in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kites\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and ah and fighting ... this is this is how we do terrorism American style this is how we do civil instability or instability he was released incivility uh American style\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up I mean this kind of stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of do CFC we're following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us\nWell I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it treats the citizens like faceless statistics\nAnd economic units three bought sold barter traded in tracked\n\nIt lies the system why is it cheats it steals it spies it kills\nBreaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to vent their empire so what they do is they create wars they they uh\nThey take over everything they they're swallowing up everything little by little\nAnd so we have this deep state that is a myth superpower ... worldwide deep state of global industrial deep state and so\nIt might get like you know network where a ... a\n... he says there are no Russia's there are no countries there are no ... there is no west there's only one organized system of systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's that is that let's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nThat's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of terrorists now we're afraid of each other we're ...\nIn ... the rising up rising up all the middle eastern terrorists now it's us but it needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate it's failed us\nAnd and what they have is they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence may want you to speak politically correct speech politically been dismissive talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't like\nWe burn the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of the global establishment has risen up against the people in the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people always cannot be ... be happy with themselves and let's say pressure other ... other people into believing the whims of of of the deep state or believing the whims of this ... solution or this course a project to get people angry at one another but see in the end\nEven more intriguing are us media reports now

were there to put it on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what didn't ring true to me is\nHave you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill more people you have in the price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true\nBut Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections\nAnd they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly\nAnd the price of gasoline would skyrocket\nWould have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide be stay manipulation heat is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to

embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequence the president United States has really no authority\nTo retaliate against Saudi Arabia but you don't watch him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey has said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and the flu is remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh they will not have a country\nFlight if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it will\nProbably do the same reason you said that you would be in a he was in Saudi Arabia

this Trump is going to be able to put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on elections and we'll just carry me through until we stabilize\nCountry war so this is
