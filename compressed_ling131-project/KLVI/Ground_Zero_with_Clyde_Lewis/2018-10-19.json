I'm only is mortgage I'm a car payment and then I'm a little bit of student loan that we've got the cash to pay it off a which was about to go at the end it off the U.S [noise]\nUm even after that we can get at least six months of\nUm you know emergency expenses that back emergency fund um I've got a four one K. and a pension she has four one K. and profit sharing and my main question is what are the extra income every month [noise]\nAnd if we should be voted at something that's strictly tied retirement what you see what we have a lot of orange it'd be better to put that into something more accessible like a like a managed a like a some have managed fund can be accessed tired to retirement if need be\nYou know we call those bridge funds I'm at some point I Would go there but I think you've got some cleaning up to do y'all been pretty sloppy you make a lot of money to be as broke as you are\nUm how long have you been making that kinda money on\nThe last couple of years okay\nIt's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess then yeah let's rides from checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them do yeah good let's do that today and then you need to have your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses not income three to six months of expenses\nAnd uh that's what we call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for a solid financial plan your debt free and you have your rainy day fund except your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps for five and six do you have children\nNot right now okay\nThen ah we would baby steps for is Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's not much with what you guys make\nBut it's a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring in doing the British stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm going to do it in the right order um [noise]\nOnce you're doing that than they used to have five kids college that does not apply here baby steps six pay off your house or lamb or reach over knock the house out beyond that which is has the same effect\nTo your net worth that the bridge loan does because having your home paid off frees you up and enables you to need a lot less income\nTo retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which really do how much do you own your home\nAll agreed to eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're forty your house is going to bite off\nAnd by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your debt one hundred percent that free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nI have a single parent in the world mathematically one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing as our bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between eight fifty two and\nYou know if you wanted to have enough to to do some stuff with before then but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth as a result\nOf having no payments\nTo go with your fabulous income uh your most powerful wealth building tool is your income we've just finished a study here that Chris Hogan is doing a book on a ... of the largest study of millionaires ever done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of ten point two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invest in there for one k.'s and once that's maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds or by some real estate that you pay cash for the income producing or something like that where you've got some other moneys that you've got access to\nThat is not return not all caught up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back of a line as to the front of the line on when you're going to get to it\nUm and you'll get there faster if you'll do it the way I'm Talking about in the way you're talking about in clean up this mess you make too much money be sitting around stupid car

arrival of something called me and PC although NBC's have been around for a long time when they are really is their computer controlled characters in video games and the problem with it\nThat they have these limited scripted responses like be show up when they go here try this or here here's one three or\nWould you like to go here that's what it is it basically gives you an idea where you need to go now although I I don't know if there are any and PCs in Fort Night because I've been watching we in place for it I don't really know of any really 'cause it's all like squads no fighting everything else but I mean I can skyrim\nOr fall out there are characters that are known as in the seats they basically babble scripted responses are limited they don't really do any me just give the parameters of the game\nSo that's why they call that's\nWhy they're using this and PC me which is basically this nondescript looking character\nTo describe those who repeat the script or the left and what we're talking about it is like for example you know orange guy oh it's orange guy you know calling President Trump orange guy that's an NBC term or um what's another one\nA dog President Trump doesn't like immigrants well why is his wife an immigrant you know NBC or it's just a bunch of things where you you've heard them right like you know KKK everybody who's outright as\nKKK everybody who's the conservatives KKK or they're they're racist that's an NBC meaning these people\nHave a limited they have a limited fountain to draw from and that was dropped from the same things and they always say the same things to people who are trying to express themselves and it and even if you sound just a little bit on the right\nThe un PC left will come in and they'll say well they'll do that so that's why they're called NBC's may have caused a lot of anger\nBecause those who see them feel that they're ... the humanizing well this is a humanizing us that's the point I mean yeah if you don't like the main create your own uh yeah it is\nThere to the human I'd been basically saying you're robots your robots they're following a program and you're listening to the program and it goes on the other side too I have heard so many programs responses whenever you say anything that he was in this bit of criticism to Donald Trump people go\nHow Jared you he's a man of God and you like what\nThe president of the United states he's not a man of God he's not\nMessiah he's not going to turn water into wine although it can't hurt and wine into something else but he can't come [laughter] I'm just saying\nYou can't do that for some reason in this country so there's NBC name mocks the left basically making them out to be expression listed appearance by like in behavior\nI mean that's sort of a causal observers right they just stand there in the case as I say oh this is the door make a left here it's like it's like being one of those talking maps make a left three hundred

scientific way like ah they want to be halfway with their religion and they want to read half way with the conscious as they want to do ... and this is where I was working for about how here we are\nGoing to shift this ... this is a a major paradigm shift\nAnd we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\nAnd then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know is not exactly what is in that somehow we reach a point where we're satisfied with their opinion\nAnd and all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree that the students like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say\nWell it's not true if it's just what you think it is see it's all about your selective perception and we know that selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception\nWe wouldn't be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light\nLifelike love survival spirituality God you know and then we're exposed

right they're not going to compartmentalize area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we learned that in old age would boost memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective it been chooses to however it's emotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd subjective experience and this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain causes assist experienced emotion critical announcers were struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\n\nAnd of course now we experienced a virtual meeting hyper

there and watch watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow that and follow their own hearts and follow their own minds\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting fatigued right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth giving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing see\nMany people who live there and not have the time nor the I guess the desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nOr by George Orwell usually but yeah they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones or groom to follow the wishes the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where

can read his what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happens is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with so you were talking about numbers and number ... symbolism\nAnd a numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the
