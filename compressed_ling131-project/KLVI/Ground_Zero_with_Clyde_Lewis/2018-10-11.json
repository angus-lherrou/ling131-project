okay now your debt free right okay yeah okay and that was foreign to\nI get so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty uh about Fifteen about fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay\nAh well we're gonna put fourteen thousand an emergency fund\nOkay so now you have an emergency fund you put ten thousand with the land you get a construction alone with the takeout loan a permanent takeout\nAnd your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on my couch okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nRank sense phone so that means you're building up two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOkay\nBecause the packages worth three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house now you're at three sixty\nAnd you don't have to ... percent down anymore okay see how that works so you get an actor auction\nLoan that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage good called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction line and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether Chuck Churchill mortgage they could probably help you with that and you can go in lock in your interest rate on your\nPermanent mortgage because he's a mortgage literature ticking up\nAnd a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you have a ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to go or Joe mortgage or it is taking up\nAnd I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights in\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago I Would love to member but we are in a rising interest rate environment not on the panic about but it is going up\nAnd so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible ray you can get your hands on for refinance were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by walking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see right to come back down dramatically um you\nKnow in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much there\nProbably going to go up and so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends um then then I'm going to walk everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage today and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nPay ... are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from a and gotten to that too good and I know you're very exciting I don't want to lose the momentum that we've had kept\nGoing toward ... and and going and the baby step three there's like a few of 'em that are happening so we want to hear three three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school can get a bachelor's they get a better paying job that would\nBe a it'd be step three\n[noise] okay so that's my question and we also want to start a family that we have competitors like baby find 'cause we want to catch that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you build up a baby fun no need to do it\nOkay to build up the emergency fund first\nMerges you finished first for you do anything and then you start during other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby\nUm if you guys got health insurance you know and you should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund implosion you know you'll be able to budget to die present and believe me you'll work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a\nI think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah the labor and delivery\nNurse that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during the non much\nOkay yeah so you can just do that whenever that happens and when everybody's on the way you can just say well run our favorite for that and\nAnd and you know anything you want to do that's an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency I'm going back to goes on emergency this Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency or you can cover it\nIt's a luxury to have that as extra savings or maybe came on the way writes it maybe got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know that they don't they're not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three\nAll right thanks for the call appreciate you joining U.S Open phones are AAA eight to five five two to five cliff is with us in Chapel Hill North Carolina Hi cliff our you\nKnow I Can't complain hair you'd make it out\nBetter than I deserve how can I help well first off I Want to thank you for what you help me and my wife to sixty five thousand dollars worth of debt cool\nAre you sir and my next question to you as a way if I don't have 'em right now we have about thirty thousand dollar down payment on a house we got to land\nWe um we get land to build our own and also we're in the air that we really want to live in a lot about what family around here gray\nSo Yes sir I according to your ... how much how can we afford what our income and the contract that we've been talking the recommended a USPA loan and you're not a fan of\nAbsolutely not no I Would never do your do you\nKnow it's a it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sell the house or go to refinance the loan at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou get really trapped in these things and other nasty bad no I never went to a USDA long I have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWow so wow now ... as far as how much how you can afford we always say I'm you know put your down payment whatever that is into the formula right and then the loan\nAmount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan which today's about five percent interest loan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan\nIs\nNo more the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay and and that puts you right where you want to be so much you've done some really good stuff open now I mean that you can really do it I mean you you've you've gotten out of debt you build your emergency fund you're doing really smart things so yeah I just get you a ...\nThe least expensive alone between F.

I mean there's also the small problem of not knowing exactly what to look for\nAnd I think you know while we've had many people saying well this is what you're supposed to look for these are many UFO researchers and writers that of take it upon themselves to the researchers and writers scientists are going we don't know exactly what we're looking for\nSo they're arguing over synthetic lives are arguing over extraterrestrial biological life they're arguing over small celled organisms are arguing over aquatic life maybe like on cell it is or\nYou know other uh ice planets are icy moons like hop in Star Wars if intelligent life does exist beyond our solar system\nI've always wondered well okay you want to communicate with alien well how are they going to communicate with us I mean I'm would they even communicate like we do I mean would they use radio transmitters that use other forms of technology to communicate I'm probably not\nAnd while people say well they shouldn't be a bounce left in our language not necessarily I mean there are plenty of smart\nOr intellectually advanced human beings who don't speak the language you speak and sometimes we if they don't speak our language of misconstrued is being not as smart and that that was one of the problems I had\nWhen I was learning a foreign language and uh you know as a young kid and I was like you know I was learning a language but I forgot\nBut you know when I'm listening to someone else to speak English from a different country you know they're trying to speak the language\nAnd sometimes we say well listen to them the way they speak they they don't know language enough so we we misinterpret that is not being very smart but the truth the matter is that the fact that he can forums they can even formed sentences the fact that they can even formed sentences that are even intelligible makes them intelligent\nIt's like the argument over whether or not millennia Trump was smart or whether or not being an underwear model major stupid and they were comparing and Michelle Obama and I thought well God you know yeah I'm a shell has her good points uh and she's pretty smart but then they said no millennia Trump stupid and I go way way way way way she speaks like what eight different languages\nAnd uh you know it's so ... I don't know how many that that Michelle Obama speaks but come on I mean if a person can speak that many languages they're really smart and if they're able to keep track of those languages they're pretty smart in fact I envy when I'd producers he speaks Mandarin Chinese\nHe speaks ... I Would love to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese because then I'd be able to say I speak English I speak Spanish and I speak Mandarin Chinese\nThe three languages that most people should learn if they want to get ahead in business only got two of them Spanish and English\nAnd Spanish is the language of labor or English and Mandarin will be the language in big business because we all know the future and we all know where China is in our future so Mandarin Chinese baby gotta learn Mandarin so you can get around and you know border things on the menu other than general ... chicken so\nThat's that's important of course if you want to be in business but see that's the thing you know communicating with alien so that's a bigger deal\nDoing if we were human language if there are a lot of other people's ear on this planet ancient languages would be difficult I don't know if anybody speaks aromatic I'm a you know made up languages I guess that's brown has made up we're going on is made up but you can still be going on in Esperanto\nBut ah using radio transmitters using other things are lights signals hell even smoke signals these are a ways of\nCommunicating and so\nThis seems to be what the preoccupation is right now\nI mean it used to be well we want proof of aliens have arrived we want them to land on the White House lawn well Sadie and Medi\nCourse the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and Medi messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international these groups are don't care a valium sign on the White House they want to be able to get a signal a techno signature they want to be able to get something\nThat can prove that they're out they're communicating they they and and believe me I'm I'm going to tell you this today I was looking over notes and what prompted me to do this show tonight was an article in business insider\nOkay Business Insider talking about what we were talking about ... nights ago\nWith regard to extraterrestrials with regards to um the numbers with regard to techno signatures with regard to listening for the communication looking up and this guy seeing whatever it is it's out there keeping your mind open\nLooking for extraterrestrials in space\nOr looking for a you know that moment you know we should be looking for those moments because those moments are happening more than we realize\nLast night there was a um\nThere was a a huge media I guess that crashed in a place called seal I guess I don't know if that's right I mean there is still a places in Oregon [noise]\nI mean it didn't count as a place in Allen County CEO I Believe it's called sci [noise]\nHuge media crash their impact explosion poll thing [noise] have laws on the air last night [noise]\nAnd that people were telling me all but I mean if you saw that last night I'll be there for me because I Want to hear the story about this thing that came down [noise] [noise] yeah huge mean your ball of fire [noise] hit the ground in ... county Oregon [noise] I was getting all kinds of reports there are a lot of others too\nIf you are the reports are now you know makes me wonder if\nYou know all this preoccupation about contact and others preoccupation about alien speaking to us [noise]\nThis isn't just an indication that they found something they're competing they found something and they're just waiting for the way to tell us the truth about it [noise]\nI'll tell you more about that coming on Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis [noise]\nOver the planet and only certain people can hear them in some of them have even been recorded\nSo we've got a few recordings story tonight these are really eerie because I'm sure many of you for the sounds of thought about I just got tonight it's or something but listen will habit up coming up for you at ground zero Tripoli six every three thirty seven hundred that's triple eats except at three thirty seven hundred will be back\nOn the News I'm Carmen Robert Baer's degree flying around it's going to cost a lot of damage it is so low it out there\nHurricane Michael hit Florida like a freight train hurling in with one hundred and fifty mile an hour winds the strongest ever to hit the panhandle flattening trees treading on into flooding straight surprisingly only one death reported it's tearing through Georgia now near Albany\nWe obviously are concerned it is on Nike any storm that we have had\nGovernor Nathan Deal telling residents to watch out for each other Michael is weakening rapidly but still hurricane with wins that's eighty five miles an hour President Trump's playing it up an eerie Pennsylvania\nDemocrats or the party of crime\nHere on the campaign trail pushing the party line in trying to drum up support for Republicans in next month's midterm elections\n[noise] this is Fox News [noise]\nOwning trying in town of ...
