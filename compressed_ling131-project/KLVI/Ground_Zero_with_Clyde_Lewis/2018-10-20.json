going to block it\nAnd that came through in Boston for sports so it was just a really phenomenal night\nYou see it at the all the time you know the NFL and on with the level ice and the kicker waiting till the last half second to take the time out how do you not want to take that how do you know if you don't wait that wait a second too long and they get to snap off it's a process\nUh I really and truly I started from the first one I started studying the mechanics of the older because that's who's going to be the goddess unless you know when the ball's 'cause we snap and what they were doing the home of looked at the kicker\nAnd ask the kicker viewers ready and as soon as he brought his head around to look at the center they were going to stop the fall fall kind of time they don't have one that he can and I'm white is somebody's head start coming around not hit the referee with the ... of course the film\n[noise] why why dry and then we'd lined up to block the thing the last time so\nIt really meant special away at all and that and your doctor blazes lane ... said all along the kick that the coach he said I think I can block it I think I can block it if I die I looked at it if you're going to die [laughter] and and sure enough he died\nIn I mean it it you know pork that bounce off like it did I mean they looked like he was filming a fun way for could come down\nTook off

actually did it for the right way we came back to her coach God did a great job of coming back to it\nOr we dropped it off and what was funny how we gave ha Walker empty I see what you're in the middle of the extra effort which has a lot of good award to have but I kinda laugh at him because he was for a walk and got the point that Mitch\nMcConnell and the change of direction that caused him to change direction reverse field when he did AJ Walker I actually got a profit feel\nAnd through a key part to set it off open for the touchdown\nYet they're all over after you know throw in reverse ... without leaving drawn rough and and then of course Harry Hill more had another great block or so I mean there was that was a team effort a rough and did a lot of work themselves\nBut uh we you

we've had him on the show to comment on\nAll things called openings bizarre and I think it's really a pleasure in our ... ... it's an awesome opportunity\nFor us to kick off this season to talk with Thomas about his new book about some of the things that are changing uh within the scope of spirituality mainly leaning towards the cult spirituality Thomas shirt as an author artist in filmmakers

welcome to ground zero\n\nHigh tide delighted to be here again\nIt's good to have you and like I said ah it it's it's just amazing to be able to have you in such a time I mean\nAs I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\nI think people will they brought these ideas for for all\nKinds of reasons I think you'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social stairs there's a sense that there's an insecurity within society you see that happening in Brooklyn tomorrow at these these wages are going to bind cabinet is other people\nLook at things like you know\nQuantum physics and these ideas that reality is malleable to a certain extent and that\nThey won't let you want to test these ideas and they want to say well you know is it you know is the five cents reality is that Malia bill is it\nKind of change it cannot alter towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out there that do this as things like magic and so people are drawn to him for that reason as well I think also there's that there's\nA kind of the maturing going off the mall and that its oil is living in the age where\nYou know people that look the especially in recent years and it seemed like the behavior of the major religions in the crimes of the Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people have set themselves with these guys don't appalling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so it\nIs evil really considering the source that's coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAnd it's becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night\nWith Chris geo injury geo we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now that certainly is causing the the left wing of the United states to be disturbed because they say it's the humanizing it it's certainly\nA it's called the NBC or the non playing character meaning they did the symbol of those who sound like they are repetitive Lee speaking from a script and it's very effective and I was saying to ah Chris last night I said isn't it interesting that this character\nKind of resembles the ... of alchemy and it seems to be very powerful it's just a simple silk like looking character grand color very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a toga or some sort of mean that that is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI'd been taken a great interest in this as soon as it came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special\nThe like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... and the way these people have been using them ethics for a few years now and we are in a different world\nThere's a basically a a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like ... to ... mold reality in terms of the political structure medicine at this ... is that is quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction to it\nIt's it's it's tapped into something very visceral and frightening in deep within the people it's been it's been aimed act it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up to these ... these kind of like a\nCultural relaxes repeaters or whether you want to call them and they're they're not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing special about them is that they're probably just like androids\nYeah and that's the thing is that they're saying oh if the humanizing it hurts us but you're right it's like putting a mirror up to them\nAnd saying look at what you're saying look at what you're doing look at what you're acting upon and it just reminded me when I saw that as a you know a several characters that have just been ... characters\nThat have been effective in the past

a this step is called the staying\nAnd a conservative Catholics were appalled and you post choices staff as evidence is something scary something diabolical something which she was going on at the Vatican\nAnd so you know while most folks do use or what is called the feral or a pastoral staff that uh has across the top of\nThis one was different this one uh looked then is Thomas commented it or is it it seems to be the staff that represents a the the nail support staff was there to the pope had nail going through it and when you look at me I Am nail in the staying\nIt symbolizes a lot of things uh\nCollege was saying that a ... that includes the ballots and that it it basically unites the part in bloom is the triple motif of a threefold serpent teen to lurk panic\nUh and uh we were

mean a lot of what you hear about is all like this ... this is some stuff that's applicable today and what we're talking about it's also possible you know I learned a term the other day a a a Thomas it was called security theater\nAnd what that term means is that really you know we have to put trust in one another because the reality is is that our lives are fragile that we have fragile lived with Jodie of lived majority of the system collapsing all these things are are a possible their ...\nAnd the truth is is that everybody or gives us a sense of security and they create the security theater by you know having child proof tops TSA the airports that sort of thing I think the church uh especially the Catholic Church now\nI think they provide this provided with a little spiritual

Catholic Church I looked at the fly on the wall\nRight now there is that you have this Pope Francis making a lot of strange statements about\nThough you know global is kind of ideas things that the church tradition they were against and he's he's stuck promoting them it's almost like desperation tactics not quite recently here at the ... visited Ireland and it was a disaster and ... he was
