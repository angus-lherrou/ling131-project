time to start looking at the next\nGeneration\nI mean the millennials are establishing themselves now\nOkay calmed down about millennials\nI Want to start talking to a generation Z Generation Z they were born proximity between Nineteen Ninety five and twenty fourteen okay that includes my step son my other son's millennial when\nHe's pretty well established himself now but my step son Liam he is Generation Z and what Generation Z is is the first digital generation they're like the Jetsons compared to what we are\n\nBeing grown up with technology from day one they're very adept at communication on social media tech savvy they've always had high speed Internet always they won't remember a time where we had the low Internet\nIt could be quake three quick Internet the beep quickly click click click Internet on average Generation Z\nSpends between six and nine hours per day consuming media and they use an average of five screens or smartphone TV laptop desktop and tablet most of them started working on a tablet at age to\n... they were just searching among them for different purposes\nAs a comparison millennials use three screens on average I'd say my generation uses to that is if they were introduced to the Internet and they do have a phone\nSo it'd be a phone and maybe a laptop and you have your laptop at work or you have a laptop at home and you use it for who knows what\nThat if you want to count the TV screen it where you sit in front of a TV and\nVeggie occasionally I just watch cartoons usually are science fiction really bad science fiction\nJust saw another

like ... and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities\nUh they're they're saying well we have trillions without one trillion sensors that we have to put in place by the you're twenty twenty\nThe FCC saying you got six Ninety Days to start figuring out how we're going in so smart city networks in your part of the woods and you've got to do it quick because if you don't we're going

but how are they gonna move all those sensors\nHow they had him put trillions of sensors in place by twenty twenty that's a lot\nBecause that's a lot of sensors to putting by but within two years or even less than two years so how do they how how do they fix that problem\nEvil intelligent dust that's the way they do it it's\nEasier to drop trillions of nano particles the size of a grain of sand or a grain of salt and they can do it in a less amount of time I'm\nSure they're reporting sensors in the bigger and and and more capable and and fiber optic and all this stuff that you put that in

far as city is a place where data eliminates first world hassles dangers\nAnd injustices that's where they're claiming but there are problems and see smart cities are are based primarily on data all day and if you want data unique sensors it's not like roads buildings in street lights are just going to wake up magically and started chatting about the weather no we need sensors\nTo see here smell tasting feel on the behalf of these machines\nWe need sensors didn't tell us when the bridge needs to be repaired we need sensors that tell us have been damaged gonna break we need sensors\nTo remind us or to tell us that made me a flood about to happen on earthquakes about to happen in anything that can be thrown in his data any data information they can get they'll have to do it by using sensors\n\nSensors measure temperature traffic patterns foot traffic air quality infrastructure integrity and just go down the list of things that these data sensors are supposed to give us well Lux research and innovation research and devise refer him\nFiled a report that suggested the world will have to deploy one trillion sensors by twenty twenty in order to fit\nThe criteria for the UN's edict on smart cities and smart city networks shows redesign smart cities around the data we want instead of the wiring we have\nThis is where it gets more complex because mass data aggregation will establish a lot of truth about how our cities are being run it's going to lead us to a social credit score for you or me and everyone else and a social credit score\nOn the quality of life metrics that each city will have\nSo let's say you want to make a choice on where you want to move your family you could look at the smart city or the smart city metrics guide based on a number based on social credit based on what kind of people lived there for the social credit scores are extremely low in a part of a different part of the country people don't want to associate with people with a low credit scores\n\nAnd so we're going to create you know where to move everybody in the city and then we're gonna have to figure out which cities are the best in the most desirable by behavioral Bye bye bye have your data data by a way of life day to the quality of life data okay so we're going to sign these smart seems to be perfect and then the aggregation\nWill be reviewed and we'll be adhered to and it's going to lead us to score cities is the latest the score people or you know it'd be like one big Yelp fast have you ever been to Yelp you know you can destroy your business by giving a business a bad review on Yelp\nIf you get enough people to rally around the basically a you know a right some bad stuff about a business you do that on Yelp yeah children business right there and there are businesses that have sued\nTo get yelled to remove certain things because people look at that and they go oh well imagine that being you twenty four hours a day I imagine that being your city twenty four hours a day but how are we going to drop one trillion sensors by\nTwenty twenty okay that means we have to drop a trillion it once we can't do it we can't drop you know\nOne sense or a year or even a million ... a year or once a year you you can't do that right and so it can be difficult to meet that by twenty twenty\nSo how do we do is how do we how do they get the problem with the smart city taking care of\nWell we do it with dust\nWe do as smart as we do it would then particles we get I mean look I was discussing this to the ground zero around and said this is the future\nThis is the Internet of things is is your city this is robo sex is everything and they say there's a glut of news about this tech stuff well it's interesting there's a lot of it they have to
