{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "West of the Rockies you're on there\nAre ... uh I caught\nYou one day last week and I I was a bad on the subject of reincarnation and I got the impression you didn't want to talk about it\nI'm pleased to talk about oh well I'm\nI I Wonder if you would get a guest on who would be opposed to it and you said you were going to have their previous on friday noon to the whole program and never came up the subject of reincarnation\nOh I see well I Would have been obvious so I mean he was a Catholic priest\nI well I Wonder yeah but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I would like to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nOn and won it excuse me why why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they said that we keep reincarnate ing and and coming back because they said that the way we learn yes\nIf you remember they always say that they say that's how we learn yes\nAnd yet on the program friday night you and the priest both agreed that that we are a lot I don't know if you remember that but\nMy point I remember it clearly\nYeah well if if we keep reincarnate and to come back at to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in wiser is what we're getting dumber and dumber and dumber ... and now there's another problem with the reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words yeah more souls\nYeah right so maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist are being an effect out voted by the ... coming along who don't know a damn thing\nI'd out now that I like now\nWhen you first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a masters in gas and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor no I haven't changed my mind at all I Do rowing several times as you know\nOh and then I must admit I hear you I I doubt Misha program that I I never heard him on your program\nOh my oh no oh well then you must not catch 'em all well I can say 'cause I'm not really on I Would say over the years probably\nAt least a half dozen times\nI think you've been on this station\nWell I don't know what station you're listening to the one year on now ah I'm On a three hundred stations man well I Know I mean oh I'm In Las Vegas\nOkay that helps you mean it'd be gee maybe not since we've been on cable you gee that's right well that's\nWhat I mean you know and uh I I Know you had him before that yeah ... ... would you consider having him of course I think he's very very interesting and that or him or any any I guess and who would give the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not and\nWhat did surprise you if you are found out he did\nA yeah yeah that would I\nI think I heard him out a lot I've I've listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that would want\nBecause people could keep messing up their lives and each time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do better than the next time and they never do that with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see oh right oh well maybe I'll have them on how 'bout that uh I\nI'm going to make sure I never miss your power than because I won't know ahead of time you announce it well I usually do announce guess ahead of time I thank you very much are\nYou all come here I'm Glad you called and uh that was Las

anything I knew one will be we're catching it\nOh golly I mean it was it was right down to the tea but he said one thing that jumped out at me when we started talking about the anti Christ ... years you have to come or may already be here right he'll be the one that will present these problems to us and then maybe show show the solution that's right and that was that was scary but\nI really enjoyed that interview with him I you know he did say that he would come back anytime and I'm Glad he said that I Hope you have you back more often\nUm well I Will and and uh the uh the but but but the parent lives there with what I I just can't wait to to look at times comes back after he is spent a month or two with putting all those resources into this next three and four\nYear young well it

I just I thought I don't even need to call attention to this uh they're all getting it\nBut I'll tell you what art I turned fifty years old I was first and I don't know whether this comes with getting older or what but\nI Know that something has changed in my life just in the last four or five years I think when you get older you get more spiritual ... or you get more introspective within you know

Bill Clinton is acceptable on a morality scale and then has he done the job the answer to that is yes\nAnd that's when I'm you know if Richard Nixon was zero\nOkay and an angel is a gym where would
