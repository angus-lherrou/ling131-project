I was thinking about doing that for like Christmas or something I Would just say this summer and I read that I liked I thought you might enjoy it because you like business\nOr something like that not like a hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat [laughter] that doesn't work right that's insulting you fall on me\nAnd also you know instead you would just say are just kind of blow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal oh daddy would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nJust yeah it's kind of keep it nonchalant and just go hey I read this I thought you might like it 'cause you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on a minute outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to\nSome people aren't listening to anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my dad in spite of his um incompetence than this one area of his life and I'm just gonna love him where he is it's all I can do\nAnd are you may you may do that your whole life ... you know he may go to his grave doing this\nAnd and so your love is not conditional upon you know whether he handles money well or not your respect for him it's not even conditional on that\nBut you're not going to take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not going to speak into your life on money issues but that's all that's all you know I don't speak into people's lives on growing hair because I Can't seem to do it on top of my head so I don't tell people how to grow here so if you can't do something you shouldn't tell people how to do it right\nOr you shouldn't have any even have an opinion this loud about it but people try all the time so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind there Julie Hi thanks for calling in ... open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Jay is in Jackson, Tennessee Hi Jay how are you\nI I Am doing slightly better than out of there and working on getting better\nGood how can I help [laughter] oh well I just wanted to say a first off I'm a lifelong ... or ... thanks to my mother and my grandmother always playing you in the car when I was a kid wow\nAt a now pay you as an adult have not always practiced as good as I should have but I'm working on that that was\nHow can I help today are well am I calling to ask about that but I'm working on Hank I'm funny enough like Maggie I got it at that will make it work Seventy hours a week and actually deliver pizzas specifically\nOkay I have called the office to make an offer on it that they have given\nMe a counter offer ...

Fox News President Trump again denouncing the rational package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and CNN\n\nFew weeks ago we discuss the arch of bail the horn guy to bail we talked about the heart the arch was set up\nSo by the Washington DC mall and how it supposedly influenced or at least have some influence over Washington DC during the Kavanaugh hearings\nAre we seeing children suffer now from paralyzing diseases and simple illnesses killing them while they sleep\nWe've\nHeard about sexual harassment sexual promiscuity sexual misconduct perversion all that stuff all part of the new streets\n\nSo it's about children being sacrificed children dying and sex and that's exactly what\nThe ancient worshipers have bailed it they had orgies and they killed kids they kill children sold Invictus hoping that the the sun would come back so they would it would bring children to\nThis God sworn God they put\nThe baby or the child in the arms of this foreign God build the fired its feet and then pull the lever and the baby would fall\nInto the fire\nBrings new meanings rocket my baby doesn't rocket bye baby when the cradle falls that will come baby\nBy kind of thing you'd say it's you know it's um it's a lot of darkness to the things we learned as children we don't realize how dark it can get\nA\nWe hear of commons gathering in New York to curse bow Donald Trump and chief justice Cavanaugh\nI mean who would even think that it would be part of the mainstream to say which is gathering from all over that area\nAre banding together to put a curse on Donald Trump but something more than a binding spell on Donald Trump cabinet though got the worst of his was the harm spell\nHis was the harm spell\nWe had a cold writer Thomas shirt in on the program exist Sherman in the cold writer and he said you know he called us we're on with him he was in Ireland we were talking with him and he says these spells will somehow backfire\nAnd cause harm to America cause harm to the families cause harm to the\nChildren cause harm to America you said this is what will happen ... last night her remarkable show that was Paul ... appeared on the show to talk about the dark wave of parasitic demons\nThey were\n... whether he says are in fasting in the world causing people to become possessed an acting like monsters to one another and well some people may not see a spiritual form of Armageddon taking place\nThere are those who see the material world crumbling would geopolitical tensions that went analyze you know when you analyze them thoroughly it would be considered civil war in other countries I mean they'd say well look at every ... or ... we're on the outside looking into what's\nGoing on here we'd say ooh that country's in civil war today I woke up uh with the news about these suspicious packages that allegedly contain pipe bombs that were sent to the Clintons the Obamas and the CNN\nOffices in New York and this happened the day after George Soros the\nYeah the suspected explosive device putting his mailbox\nWell this has created some mass hysteria in the news rooms that are predominantly left wing and and and the left wing mouth pieces are are simply speaking for the resistance now and it's all Trump's fault\nAgain but this is happening it's got to turn down the rhetoric stop saying that news is fake all these the the excuses to just explain the attack is similar to\nThe rice in biological effects that happened before the cabinet decision was made it as I reported there would be a final blow event\nIt would certainly affect us remember I said that the final blow and I said it would be a biological attack and I was asked to be on the Alex Jones show and I declared there I said it will be a biological attack\nAnd when it happened I was suspicious of it because um it\nFailed and and it didn't you know it was a biological scare okay when I was thinking that this would be a trigger that would create copycat attacks\nI was asked to go on the uh go up to begin to go into the Alex Jones ... one day and for worse again and Alex asked ... what is next quiet what do you think is going to happen next and I said well we're not going to bend would start a war footing in the United states and he said I agree I agree well\nToday I was notified it'd be tempted bombings and it was sent an email that featured in October third twenty Eighteen article for the Daily Beast and this was the headline said Kevin are could be the final blow\nFor Democratic Senate everything happening around the issues the final blow\nIs about cabin on Senate war what comes with is asymmetrical these ... symmetrical attempts at a decapitation strike all is it appears to be perpetrated by deep intelligence conspirators within the opposite agencies and you can call it an inside job if you want\nBut in order to declare it a false flag which I hear everybody calling it there has to be\nA suspect in order for the accusation mistake but I mean by that is we need to see what they decide or who they decided to bring forward as a suspect in so far there is no suspect which it makes it even more suspicious that this uh this is a bad day false flag if it if it's a false flag it'll K\nIt really did happen yes the pipe bombs were\nThat may didn't blow up any one but\nI Want to know who they decide dependent\nOn and then we'll know just how keeping now how many gaping holes are are in the story there already gaping hole in the story now and I'm sure I'm not some guess on the pointed out we have a\nA few people that are ... you know well versed in this stuff they're not conspiracy theorists they're very uh important people and you'll be hearing from him soon\nBut the final blow issue you know whether or not you know we reached that point now I mean what\nDoes happen today I mean like I said you can call them inside job I mean no bombs were detonated it makes the entire attack a bit of political theater in order to create a terrorist bogeyman that attacks the left in order to gain sympathy for the vote and this is what they do and the third world you know they do some third world countries and most of the time the suspects are always traced to rogue intelligence or rogue military actors\nI mean like the guy who um ... for the rice and he was from Logan, Utah and I think it was an ex marine\nYeah rogue military actors are Rogan challenges actors that do that somebody who was involved with intelligence or military uh is usually the suspect they they they choose or they they use a scapegoat or a Patsy and this is where the false wide starts to ... starts to materialize\nMean these extra always carried out for what are called decapitation strikes which of course is a military strategy\nWhich is aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of what is perceived to be a hostile government or group so it's a tactic of civil war or strategist with other government plot to a limited military generals or even political leaders you know if you recall the rice and attacks\nWere aimed at the president and military leaders and the latest bomb attacks are aimed at Democrats who are former leaders\nSo this is a tit for tat exercise this is the copycat exercise this is\nPart of the final blow affect it all started back when Kavanaugh was appointed chief justice it all started the you know it it it it lingers\nBecause of the fact that there is this is Hillary Clinton said she said something the effect how can you be civil to a government and the civility we'll come back if you just allow us our positions in the Senate\nAnd Donald Trump says well no there's going to be violence if if ah no matter what happens the violence\nIs happening and I still argue that if\nIf we were looking in on a country doing what we're doing we\nWould call it a civil war I mean think about it you got people in the streets that are fighting with one another you got you know presidents and generals getting sent poison in the mail you're getting pipe bombs and and I don't know if they were even capable of exploding where you get pipe bombs or what looked like pipe bomb sent to officials\nNow how are they able to do all the addresses these officials were to send them and how to send them\nThere are a lot of give away to the tell me that somebody is not very bright and then it looked at some of the ... the ... or or the ... if you want to [laughter] whether the bomb below 'cause if you will or the ... hopes bitter there don't have any post mark on them\nAnd it's like how can you get a pipe bomb through um the male\nWe can't even give a damn CD weren't petri on good subscribers right Ron [noise]\nBut not one of these bombs went off\nSo they were sending a a pipe bomb with the triggering mechanism on it you know they weren't there those those bombs were there to take anybody out there were there to scare people they were they were they were basically scare type of of tools there were there do\nAh they weren't there to a a\nKill anyone and uh and so that raises my my eyebrows just a little bit but I also saw the John\nBrennan or ... or bumble bee they said the bomb below John Brennan Time Warner CNN ten Columbus Circle New York New York just standing there and apparently all we have are just maybe six stamp there are no post marks on the\nOn the package so I'm Wondering if it was courier hand delivered or what [noise]\nBut um he [noise] he just there's so many things that\nHave to get through the night to make this a thorough report as one of those situations where\nI wanted to get on with Halloween and uh I'm\nI'm [noise]\nI'm committed to getting the story you tonight I got gas and everything lined up at the store do about what's happening

really tough and it's annoying when you uh read headlines that\nWell for example let me go here this is a headline I just got a mainstream media blames Trump Alex Jones pipe bomb false flag infowars mid term as\nIt's like uh okay I Want to make some things clear and this is why I waited day usually but I didn't want a way to date 'cause I don't want to go anywhere near Halloween with this nonsense I Want to do it on the same day but\nI Want to say this first and foremost local and federal ... would you look at a local and federal authorities here they're investigating this now\nThey have not commented on who who the bomb maker or the bomb makers may be they don't know what their motives would be I mean we can yes with their motives are Trump condemned the X. today for the White House wasn't enough though for CNN no\nBut he did a\nBut the whole lack of evidence the whole mystery I mean there are holes in the script\nI agree but\nYou know the fringe voices on both ... both right and left make this a prime opportunity for misinformation\nAnd uh\nYou know eight Chen or on the Internet said that something was going to go down in fact they said it was some sort of a plot to stay just shooting at a rally or something like that and that there was some sort of political stunt in the works up and even though\nYou see the media going after chewing on and you go after all these others or you go after a Alex Jones\nThere are a lot of liberal people too and they're they're just as quick to pin the blame on Republicans without knowing anything about the bombers identity or motives\nYou know I saw three day you own this GOP every last ugly I owe to the destruction of our democracy you oh this this is insanity okay\nOr the other person a Philippe Philippe rhyme who is actually a Clinton advisor said President Trump visited San you this is all about you know thinking about the rice in attacks\nAnd know condemnation of the rights of the tax even though President Trump was the target even with the generals were target\n\nThere's also some report of a bomb being sent to the White House there were no bumps into the White House\n\nCNN reported it and then of course CNN being the factual news organization they are we're wrong\nOkay and then of course governor pale and Sarah Palin she shared it wrong so I mean uh nothing happened the home of the president it was all these democratic you know outspoken kicking when they're down types that they've got that stuff\nSo\nThis is the first and foremost thing that I Want to kind of cover as as soon as this is my job I guess to be a conspiracy analysts for misinformation buster pay these bumbling hopes\nThe bomb scares all that this is going to create a perfect storm for misinformation\nI mean what you get and that I Am I'm being\nKind of an an a and and doing some analysis I mean the analysts here what you get is you get breaking news reports and we read from we we've proven its with nine eleven the nine eleven shall we did a while back I wanted to I Want to just kind of reiterate this\nYou get breaking news reports which are always riddled with holes there's a lot of unanswered questions is a lot of a gag and going on where they the gag police officers and FBI\nI mean who said the packages were they address to what was inside where they really all bombs et cetera et cetera set in any incidents involve\nHigh profile polarizing figures in American politics who already are the frequent subjects of misinformation who already spout in misinformation and then of course you have the

all the stuff like you do and I do and I know rod those you sift through intelligence and information you guys are on top of this stuff and that's that's good because that means that\nUh I don't have

one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where\nWe just stress the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we have a civil war I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree it's such a disagreement about how our system was run and we have a ... we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a you know\nBorder divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability is\nIncreasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nAnd I know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict then one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulpit and say what about your guns guys weren't going to war here in this country\nBut the establishment a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration has proposed by none other than John McCain\n\nWho now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day where the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post as to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary\nStandards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and uh actually executed by those in the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be infringed and national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution number two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\n\nNumber three\nThere will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate Asian of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out and of course we have been analyzing in speculating about dean state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst said this is a\nAn invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government is not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow government is always been\nThe dark command that to a a leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nWhile we're looking under rocks for falsify proof while we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson or sent rice and and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressman during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this\nDoesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all just were attacking officials but this isn't registering in the media today the only thing that's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\n\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic and it's becoming more and more pervasive\nThese are attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance they're using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique Republicans are not unique in the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nBe attacks are happening to a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's they're journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent a journalist we've had a rice and being sent a journalist\nFrom time to wake up\nSome Americans if it is Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders just like in John carpenter's a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has been glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\nThe film still remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible\nFor the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance is is forty years sequel is selling out to the theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced us to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul\nWhen he also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds with every moment in the film they live\nCarpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens and appears to be some silent alien infestation the echoes the films invasion of the body Snatchers if you remember that film\nHowever in the body Snatchers movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpenters shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and they have allowed technology to run amok\nThey have allowed the lead to choose their values they are unaware that the war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism so the bottom line is the message has been quite clear and no one seems to be listening we're being fed a series\nOf carefully contrived fictions there no resemblance to reality [noise]\nAnd the agent provocateurs create these attacks in order for us to feel as though we are threatened by forces beyond our control [noise]\nAnd with these tactics they're able to destabilize the country making us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices and in others throats these types of events generate a lot of fear based retaliation\nTheir symptoms if Tom part of or with it\nOf the political discourse is one of the first signs of civil war the idea that violence is the only way to somehow or change the discourse is part of civil war all of these factions are part of civil war and the only reason why\nPeople don't think we're in civil war is because it didn't happen the way they were told it was going to happen we're not having an armed conflict right now between America and they'd be American shooting Americans well I mean American shoot Americans every day\nOr Chicago or it seems to be a highly climbed written with guns going up and things happening like that but when we have bombs in the leadership where we have people who have to a planet around mob these are\n... and parts Pataki part\nDesigned post symptoms perhaps of what would be a civil war and as I say the diagnosis is not come from you it comes from history and I said sometimes you don't know what you read until you have somebody step out until you you're in the middle of something you better get out of it\nSooner what's going to get worse Roger Landry would have stood on a ground zero more from him and more from your culture belief exemption three pretty
