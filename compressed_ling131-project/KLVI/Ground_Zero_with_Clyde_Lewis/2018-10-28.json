one eight hundred six one eight eight to five five\nMaking that gave me moving\nOh well I'm sure than a ... organization being very sensitive to that sort of thing I'm there will be repercussions but I was very interesting um but\nI Can't let me tell you what let me confirmed that story and I'll get it out All right\nYeah All right today on typically go I think I gave me than ...\nWell I I can I I I Will know what their stance would be ma'am thank you let me please investigate that story before I ...\nA because that is a very a very very serious charge and I'm not down in your word or but should you be wrong about something like that uh there would be very serious a legal repercussions so let me find out about that\n\nUh but uh even if true or is it is certainly an isolated incident I'm not significant compared to what Chris Ruddy ah seems to have come up with here\n\nYou know Charlie is reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's gonna be typical of the liberals and I guess there is going to be no way no escape from the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nSimply going after this president and maybe it is that\nThe midget liberal mind the myopic mind to the average liberal like Charlie cannot react in any other way even too serious\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk of the way by saying that it's um I'm conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals\nA great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised [noise] first time caller line you're on the air I hello I can barely hear you there you're going to have to get into the phone and shout out us\nOh okay I'm In here and yes ma'am and that\nLast night or someone Carter was that ah I'm hey I'm Bob\n... comment yes right in the head of the fell off it did yes\nAh oh I don't think you mentioned that last night the kid there are\nNo idea I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight but that you had asked will we get a warning I did\nWell well I mean in in sort of a general way I have yeah sure if a comet where to hit earth would we know about it yeah\nWell I'm On a April twenty third on your ...\nYes and half a\nWith Catholic profit yes correct\nAnd he said that the boy they can no warning with the great accept Murphy and I'll fly cross would appear and the guy that might have rather than\nUm well All right thank you it may be man it may be and uh there was interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the piece that broke off which by the way is not\nIn the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a spiral\nUm and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs are very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comment\nOr somebody worried [laughter] it is a piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off that you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is new break off these you've got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get bright\nThe question the good question is\nWhy is it bright at All right now in other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of the common itself or a piece that breaks off there should not be enough energy from the sun to be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we will question or Richard ... about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that program\nFriday night Saturday morning he's got a lot to say I'm not so much about the common but we will again ask about that because there must be energy to create the burn off that creates the reflected light that we see\nAnd where is that energy coming from east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning are Tim calling from taking um\nUh the lady just call not too long ago yeah thought the\nOther guy produced or directed powder yeah\nAt the true story I've got a copy of the store right here by an Associated Press writer uh-huh it's in a newspaper and it shows um [noise] I'm a young man picketing in front of the theater who are at the\n... would you do me a big favor yeah would you facts that to me\nI'm not able to because I'm\nAll right I'm then fine let me just ask that somebody fax it to me and I guarantee they will and as soon as they do we'll talk about it\nOkay how's that sounds\nGood right so somebody out there with a fax machine God Knows we sold enough of them a fax me that article and I'm Glad the covered it I just want to be very careful very cautious I'm sure it's totally on\nThe up and up [noise] but [noise] the allegation involved is very serious allegation and um [noise] I Want to be careful and have my dogs in a row before I open my\nYou know [noise] having said that we will be back in some markets in a moment you are listening to our bill\nSomewhere in time if you're not free drink coast to coast a up\nFrom October twenty foot Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\n\n\n\nAs saying the minister Louis Farrakhan leader of the million Man March in Washington DC told a stunned the crowd at a Washington Baptist church that the march was inspired by an extra terrestrial vision he had ten years ago\nA UFO he said swept him off to a space ship where the late ... illogical Mohammed told him the president Ronald Reagan was plotting a war\nFarrah Khan was then beamed back to earth he said quote I really don't care if you think I'm nuts and quote he told the church without elaborating on how his vision was connected to the march\nWow\nWell maybe I'd been pursuing Louis Farrakhan as a guest in the wrong way and maybe he would respond to an invitation to dreamland\n[laughter] what do you think art the Vince Foster situation and I think this is good advice for everybody\nHe says if the truth\nShell set us free than a lie whether blatant or sin of omission she'll keep us bound prisoners of those who would have us in darkness in ignorance so they can continue to control\nThe Vince Foster a scandal could very well be the tip of an iceberg when further investigated could revealed to the American people that our government is built on a mountain of lies\nWhen given the truth history has demonstrated that people will rise up even in the face of the greatest adversity in danger to preserve the human spirit Republican or Democrat conservative or liberal female or male young or old\nWe deserve to be told the truth\nMost sincerely is your program appreciated by this one signed is a Dora there is a name for you in San Diego\nWell is that is exactly the way I feel about it I'm not afraid of the truth\n\nI'm just not afraid of it and I'm not afraid of where it leads and you may or may not have noticed this about me yet but I Do not respond to individual items presented to me it is a logically\nI just don't I respond to them I Hope uh directly in pragmatically\nUm and examine each one for its worth I don't in other words I don't I Do have I Am basically ... fairly moderate conservative\nBut I'm not a reactionary I look at each thing as it comes along and I'm not afraid of the truth I'm just not and if it ever gets to the point where I Am then I Need to walk away from this job and I'm not going to do that\nUntil it gets in and hopefully it never does\n\nI mean if I had to come on here and in effect serve my masters\nYou know whoever they might be\nI couldn't do it\nI'll just leave it at that I you know I'll just leave it at that I couldn't do it and wouldn't do it\n\nIt's not what this job is all about at least not for me\nOkay east of the Rockies you're on the air high\nArt I'm black job yet on I saw him on sixty minutes\nYou're talking about Chris Ruddy\nAnd they found him I look I got ... everybody's got a conspiracy theories out there right I mean you've got to admit it's pretty uh pretty funny\nUm I saw the peace yes and um then they not only dumped him sure but they left or the better part of him on the cutting room floor they took words out of his sentences did you know that\nOh come on my wallet wipe 'em around what are you kidding me it comes on your show is like an art bell groupie all of a sudden are softer really ah\nAh so you think there's a panel of forensic experts best in the world in the handwriting their analysis saying it's a forgery is meaningless\nI think I think for the OJ trial where we know how to see if I weren't that people know about anything I mean I'll tell you fired at right now\nIs that right for you you're not aware of how much of a science handwriting analysis is\nBut I haven't fought for who killed them quite and kill them or oh I'm not I'm not Riyad won't shot on my cellphone look\nWouldn't you say obviously you know you're you're reacting the way very much the way Charlie did right wouldn't\nYou say this is evidence that is so strong that it demands that the the press the media and investigative agencies pursue it you you really would tell me it doesn't demand that\nOur minutes a day on the news I agree with you on that part I mean you know but\nAll these cover up of things I mean\n... what the UFOs and things through I mean why would the government want to hide you up all his from off if they found a flying saucer why not tall off I I mean your show is based on conspiracy all the time I read it you know it it makes me nervous no it's not I mean you're telling me there's going to be a war on at a border I I\nI didn't tell you that between the militia men and I don't know what's going\nOn idled you the dean come to know how to blend to send two hundred and fifty thousand militiamen down the border yes that is true\nBut what happened with that um if we're lucky not much\nAll I mean it is the big news a couple of weeks ago you're telling me about all our board\nOn well overly hopefully we manage\nTo um quiet that one down I Hope to hell that's true I brought a information person on national in a militia information person who tried to say it's a bad idea don't do it and with any luck enough people will not do it so we won't have trouble\nOkay
