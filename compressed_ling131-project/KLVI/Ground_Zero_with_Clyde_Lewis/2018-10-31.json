{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "Um ending up with a you know six thousand square foot home I'm going to only four twenty happy and and also the value of the home at that time would be somewhere in the upper nine hundred to a million dollars [noise]\nUh what is the a typical home so for a and within two or three block area of your house\nAbout the typical home and there's not really a typical home in our area it's all over the place because of tours property there's you know Fifteen hundred square foot home and then there's also three million dollar homes across the street so I come from my home is about four four ten or twenty yeah\nThat one when I was asking I was trying to determine if you're trying to over build the neighborhood doesn't sound like a no cause of scenario not an area that's got this wide diverse a price range and that doesn't mean cause I don't want you get building nine hundred thousand dollar home on a six hundred thousand dollar street\nRight yeah and I couldn't get out and we do have a to point three million dollar home just right around the corner and then there's an eight hundred and Seventy catty corner to where I Am at\nYou know when's the baby ... baby it'll do in the end of January\nOkay well sure when it started before then\n[noise] no no we're or have you go and play\nHave you got some plans for on yet\n[laughter] yeah I I've been working on that with an architect um were were you know running around or or we want to do but or just um you know I've never spoken with any expert about this and I'm not sure if this\nWas a building you know I mean there's two or three factors one is um you don't want to rebuild the neighborhood we've addressed that too is you want to seek in your family handle you know construction noise\nFor a whatever time it takes you to put this thing up and shouldn't be a nine day project maybe two or three months can they put up with that what they ought to be able to leave her by just sets that that's what we're going to do 'cause moving is more disruptive than that\nBy and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man or thinking of going to it's more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\n[noise] we have to basically tripling the size of the home now\nYou know uh so you're going to end up with a mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage maybe I think we're going to end up somewhere and the four twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house I am\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... about fifty five\nTo six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from ... last year last year we were I was somewhere in the two twenty area\nOkay well you're going to worry about her income and you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage it's almost like you're building a house correct\nAnd you can tell you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage or the payment is no more than a force of your take on pay and if that's where you're going to end up\nAnd you've got a process to get there then yes I Would do that uh I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project and you're living next door to it um yeah\nThat probably is going to take six months um most of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... the four thousand square foot addition to Nineteen hundred square foot house gender is with us in tech Dana Hi ginger and how are you\nGetting right good how can I I don't want to now\nMy husband and I we have work constantly are quite a while and we have finally paid off our market share all of our cars everything everything we own our great we have so much\nUm we're still working that way we have been trying I thought OK already amount or a ... a year and me I'm a ... year next month\nAnd up until now we have then put it well now last night we had been putting all that and the ... the last minute\nYou know what I should say we had been putting our income that we weren't at and saving living off of the security okay my question to you is where our retirement or one bite me\nA ... down mhm and what our total expensive for ... for a house here\nOur income on security what do you think that much retiring at the end up next year\nYou know how old are you on how old are you\nI'm sixty six and seven\nOkay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay and the one we only had a hundred and twenty out and our next to eggs we have a lot at another hundred thousand mhm\nOkay that's two hundred and twenty thousand in a dish round numbers I mean if you made 'em ten percent on that between two thousand dollars a year okay okay I figured you know\nAnd so if you invest and we found out that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too\nThat um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly uh I mean you you have\nA few thousand dollars a month liberal but I mean you've got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money is what we're talking about here and I'm ... and plus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers then you can retire if you want to\nBut a ... that's not going to be an easy I mean it's not going to be retiring and luxury uh but you should have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off so that's good\nUm I Love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you can work a little bit more than ... that might be up not be a bad thing but if you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not shut up and saying we're um draining down\nThat two hundred and twenty systematically just to retire now\nBecause that's there's an end to that game called hunger and I don't want to get there\nYou don't want to destroy this good so you just live off the gold and eggs on like so whatever you know you sit down with your investment professional if you don't have one sit down with one of our smart buster pros and talk about investing there's two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you that creates an income that you can live off of that plus your Social Security\nAnd if you can do that then you're in a position to do it\nAnd um but again it's not going to be um a a\nA luxurious retirement you're not traveling the world and\nUh you know and that kinda stuff on this income uh but but but\nI think you can do it it's just a matter are you willing to live that frugally and put your budget\nTogether and say these are the numbers and I'm going to live on less than this and that's the only way we can retire and then again sit down with us from our best are pro clicks Mart best Hervey Ramsey dot com and listen to people in your area we recommend and then one of them will help your
