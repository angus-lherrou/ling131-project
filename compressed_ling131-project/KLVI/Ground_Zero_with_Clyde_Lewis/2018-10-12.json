{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "So here's the thing we know about putting miles on a car and you know this is the more miles you put on the car the more you destroy its value correct\nCorrect\nAnd so if I'm going to travel um or for instance people who travel for a living people road warriors I call them they you know there there have to travel for work all the time I'm In that case you want to drive in that case you want to drive the least expensive vehicle to get the job done because you're destroying whatever you drive\nI mean you might want to drive a hundred thousand dollar car you it's going to be worth nothing by the time he finished traveling\nAnd so I'm unless you've just got millions of dollars and you can afford to lose a hundred grand but but you know most people don't have that so basically what we're saying is you're going to take the Seventeen thousand our vehicle and you're going to cause it to drop in value faster than anything else what's your household income\nUm I make about eighty thousand okay you're single ... single bachelor rental renting a small little okay alright since I'm always hanging out you have any debt or just the car that's ... ...\nUm eleven thousand okay All right\nWell there's nothing you know I'm hearing here this crazy as long as you realize that you know the Seventeen thousand dollar car might be worth um you're going to lose a few thousand dollars extra on it just because you're going to travel in it okay\nAnd as long as you're willing to do that and what the kind of money you make you should be okay let's get the car paid off as soon as possible so your preferences keep it in private is that right\nOr my publisher to keep it from five or six years yeah but my friends and coworkers or whatever the fate betray they betrayed of you're crazy to keep it to traded in for what um last night on I I was sitting around the brand new BMW forty uh-huh exiled falling in love with\nRon well that'd be easy to fall in love with that but the but that's even more expensive so we're going to destroy even more expensive car if you want to travel and that right\nYeah and to upgrade to a brand new one you know that would be twenty percent less\nWell number one they're in there and you don't have the money to do that so that's ludicrous we wouldn't do it on that basis alone but on the idea that you're going to travel in it no you don't want to you know you don't want to upgrade and destroying more expensive cars about how you\nShow if you if you're going to travel you need to run the wheels off for something that's not going to cost you as much\nSo we don't upgrade in order to lose more money when we don't have any money that that doesn't make sense at all so whoever your friends are I mean they're they're encouraging you lose stupidity but I've had friends that have encouraged me to do is to build him I didn't have to do it though uh Brian's with us in Bakersfield, California hey Brian how are you\nBetter than had been there day how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nOkay they've so far I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased they ridiculous car [laughter] and as soon as I found you I was like crap\n[laughter] oh what'd you bought\nWe bought a two thousand ... with all the bells and whistles\nSo we eat yeah\nWell not for free 'cause my pocket hurts\nYeah well I guess but I mean the cars great\nNow okay oh yeah so what what do you owe on a similar thing we'll thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your house hand them\nThis year will be making sixty sixty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my overtime oh yeah those are just starting on you know\nSo that and I'm next year I'll be getting into a Fifteen Percent right plus another five percent right down the road yeah I'm so here's my ... I'm calling to see if you what if you're OK with fish a memo I finally agreed to let it go\nGood and sell it good it's worth Twenty one thousand oh God yeah she ... down into it or die that\nBad yeah and I thought that it only took like three months good lord so Twenty one guy on trade in\nYes well I mean you know twenty three on private sale\nSomething that that's not enough to spread on ... so you're saying this car went from thirty five thousand uh twenty three thousand and one year\nActually technically over forty thousand two thirty five thousand I I also canceled the warranty on it\n'cause we had any extending warranty yeah and then we found out that it's funny how when you pay off vehicle or you reached ... miles to all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and to our chief counsel to you or did it\nThe cars one are old\nAnd I almost a year old yeah\nAll right so yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nYou know finance or me and my wife has been looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could save up that money and I already had to buy an extra income refund but what I was thinking is because our monthly payment for the throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars\nSo because I also have stood among and assume I'm famous I won't sixty eight but almost done with I only have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm bar all the difference and then go to the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars and just make payments off on this for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making a mess\nMhm yeah I mean we okay with that yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing your second car the money by on just a the five thousand dollar car that you're buying how are you financing it\nThey'll just go ahead just like you know just like you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nKnow that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your\nThat by half right and um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting that car paid off and then getting the whole that your dog with this other car which is absolutely horrendous it's a great car I'm surprised that thing has dropped that foreign value\nI'm sure you got your numbers right on that because I I mean I [noise] the cars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a car guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like it that's incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding his values so check out and make sure your number your numbers are a little high\nOn terms of lost money I think you maybe you have a loss as much I'm hoping you lost as much as you think you've lost so let's dig into that little bit further and you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to sell it private say it should be in this situation about five of them are different\nIn other words you should be able to get five or more out of it shown it private show than you would for a dealer on something that expensive\nUm show really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but wow water that gum kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing and good luck with it but yes I Would get out of it\nFor sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking I mean there's nothing good of a story thanks for the call\nSo that was this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books things

China down without giving them a chance I mean this was normal America All right and we were living in the normal ... America without a conspiracy in the background trying to bring it down we would be just coming out of the honeymoon with President Trump\nYou know there's ... there is a honeymoon right there was a

it'll turn maybe eventually you'll do something while loving everybody in the country of Donald Trump as a savior he's ... he's got he's wonderful\nWho knows I I just don't see how this is going to go anywhere but bad because like I said I'm I mean last night I think it was pretty evident\nThat I really needed to escape the reality of discord not only in my country but in my state here in Portland, Oregon where I live but It's MORNING I woke up thinking about the speech the President Nixon gave it is not a member a he was back in sixty nine\nI'm Nixon was speaking and he said mankind how'd he said he said some mankind I was reaching what magnificent precision for the moon\nBut falling into Iraq is just court on our small a shock to me um\nHe basically said that it was really unfortunate that we're living in times where are we reached the magnificent precision of going to the moon reaching out to was above us but we fall into discord here on earth\nWe tend to fight here on earth but we're trying to go out and dismay and I thought about that for a minute I thought that you know here we are getting all kinds of messages from the sky I mean technological notes tech you\nKnow these these these things are looking for the ... there were Nineteen more fast radio ... genome at Nineteen fast radio burst\nBut they collected in Australia that I mean that it just going up and up and up

I hate I hate everything you're saying I hate it I hate it so we got going on right now\nBut he all the anger you know\nWe all know what they're against but do we know therefore no we don't because that's how we are known America we know what we don't like but we're not talking enough about what we do like\nI like aliens I liked the fact that they're fighting these wonder is things in space right now but what I Do like what I hate is they're not talking about it enough on the news no they're not\n\nMean fact the truth about what is out there and the seriousness ... the series is uh uh

O. V. I. [noise]\n\nThe response to Hillary Clinton talking about notes civility was the number of flights for example the New York post newspapers saying civil war civil war civil war [noise]\nThe number of people going to the Internet saying oh it it feels like we're civil war even a you know they were a lot of\nPeople James Woods a matter of fact\nThe actor James Woods was tweeting actually got shadow banned for tweeting that if if if Hillary Clinton wants civil war will give him a civil war\nSo about whatever it was sad you know I talked about how I felt like we were in the middle of one number of them were threatening and Hillary Clinton said well you know we're not going to be civil unless you know we take back what we have and Donald Trump says well if we lose there will be violence\nSo\nWhat is that going to do for America I mean what are you going to do about this that's the question I have is that you know and so you go to the Internet and you try to you know state where you want to stay on Facebook what is Facebook do well\nThey go after eight hundred Web pages shut 'em down eight hundred a Facebook pages especially some that have\nA lot of power like a nation in distress it was the first online publication you endorsed President Trump um three point two million likes three million followers gone\nGone because of a what they were where they were saying back then of course ah reimburse ... seven hundred thousand followers attacked Trump referred to Republicans is cheating scum bags\nSo a political rhetoric they were saying it was done because they were ... I think what was going on is probably both of them had something to say about the civil war or the idea of a civil war and that they were taking down\nBecause it just seems to me they were going pretty good at it but they only mentioned these I think these ... these are the ones that make them look like they did this uh you know fairly you take away a conservative you take away a liberal you know what they're saying is we're taking away extremist\nWere removing the extremists from the Internet then in eighty five page briefing comes out called the good censor\nLeaks to the press from Google would you advise is all of the tech companies to police tone instead of content and\nNot to take sides with censoring users ah you know this is their rushed to say wow we got to do something because if we do we show our hand and say that we can remove all the conservative viewpoints then there's going to be held to pay with conservative\nSo watch these groups these moves are very important to watch\nBecause\nWe see this internal leak a Google and we realize\nThat of course well this okay this is what they were saying and their and their memo to some of the fact that\nThey may believe in change they say we will change with the times it's necessary meaning that if they just so happened to wipe out if you search entries based on tone then they can make that dragging apply deal with China and no one will feel that this is some sort of people move this weather briefing says if I can get a quick\nSays Google might continue to shift with the times change and get stance on how much or how little it censors due to public governmental commercial purposes or pressures if it does\nA knowledge of what this shift in position means for users in for Google is essential shifting blindly are silently in one direction or another rightly insights users fury\nAnd I think about that okay so\nBoth sides say violence gay November you don't vote Republican violets\n... says we will not be civil until we take over\nSyria to leaders threatening violence hoping their their their zealous followers will start a civil war [noise] but then you see the Internet now going after Web sites that are radically inclined bowed liberal and conservative [noise]\nAnd then Google issues a statement saying that we certainly don't want to eliminate certain viewpoint\nTo start dating site users fury [noise]\n\nSomething scaring the gay something just scared them and I think what scared them you are the statement\nThat you heard from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump [noise]\n\nThey don't want to be responsible for civil war they don't want to be liable for civil war and now the media's got to wise up too because they're encouraging it more so than anybody else now dribbling fix every

if we look through history which we see that a frightening populist divided populace a welt tried and true results come from\nAll the same succession sequences there's other moments in history like the times of Hitler's ... Soviet Russia Mao's China and as I talked about many times we argued time dirty war\nSo what if something happened that were treated small uprising or a big surprise me and that uprising turned into full on civil war\nI keep in mind that insurrection combative and revolutionary been through history had small skirmishes before the big ones are up to this is why now\nWe should take a page from history and understand that we're about to witness the return of what would be called ...\nMob or the ... or the vigilante justice or perhaps even something a lot worse\nAnd the reason why I said this is because of the fact that a couple of nights ago I did a show called new in New justice no peace\nAnd ah I attempted to point out that ... the traditional way we think of civil war in this country is causing the fact\nThat we're already in one end well no one will attribute school shootings to beat the gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war in progress our leaders both left and right acknowledged that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\nPresident Trump has warned\nThat there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people and I'm sure he mentioned he did mention that they were on the on the left many people have told me the left or violent quiet you gotta start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent\nI've seen that myself here in my own home town I've seen it all over the country now this type of rhetoric do the Donald Trump talked about the violence if we don't when\nHe's now being foot noted and being pointed out by the news that you know they basically saying we'll see you see you see he wants to violence\nYou see the arguments are such that they can be both ways\nAnd extremism became even more intense after CNN's Christian um and for sat down with the

violence\nDonald Trump's that violence if the Republicans don't get the vote Hillary Clinton says violence until we get the boat or we we have this instability until we get the votes so\nThe motive of

well for some reason we have two very corrupt leaders are mere\nPortland is a corrupt leader and the mayor in a in a new governor of Oregon in super corrupt\nAnd both of them are in power right now

not mean a civil war no not necessarily all means no not necessarily not at all civil means states Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means it means\nWithin state instead of with other states that is what civil war means and that's the idea was civility nothing however\nHillary said the exact opposite of go do a the violence that the civil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the worst civil suggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying\nShe's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as I said\nIt's a dog whistle it's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it wow\nShe all she had to do was dropped that word because it confuses too many people and that way she's not saying anything bad she's nine citing any violence he's just saying I'm don't be nice but\nShe's using that word because we don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nWhat in that
