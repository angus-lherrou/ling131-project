I didn't get a chance to ask you we um did you have you ever used the board at all\nUm usable many times and what have you used it for five years to\nTo try to talk to friends that have passed and and study the port of my uncle told me\nAnd he was more he was a my grandfather was was kind of an old school guy but the young my uncle was more of a fun it will actually he said that Bob shed that closed every murder everything is in the board\nSo I've been studied the board at all these years really since the seventies\nAnd I figured at a certain clues\nIn the border all this little if it's it's unusual you look at the border all the all the little clues but I don't have the answers to most of them the one I just got the longitude and latitude one crime scene is on the board\nThat data she I think is true and then the uh he said the eyes my uncle felt that the eyes all the sets of eyes because the eyes ... each I was ... visors victim\nAnd I'm Seventy nine Seventy not\nGetting out of debt can seem impossible but it doesn't have to be this way I'm Talking now with Gabby Maldonado cofounder of the American financing now Gabby explained to me how low rate mortgage can help you get out of debt faster\nWell they having high balances on credit cards or student loans you're getting hit with double digit interest fees they can get ... minutes Snyder by consolidating into a lower rate home loan you can save up to one thousand dollars a month and you're paid less an overall and chest you may even be able to improve your credit score\nWhat a difference a lower interest rate makes one thousand dollars in monthly savings and even greater savings over the life of your loan\nFolks don't wait any longer it just takes ten minutes to get started and you may be able to closing as fast as ten days called eight eight eight nine nine eight eighty twenty eight eight eight nine nine eight eighty twenty or online at American financing dot net\nAmerican financing in my last one to three three for ... consumer access data\nWill get rid of her parents are from all of our members\nHorrible proper harm tonight I'll work\nThe air on line or on your phone ... latest news and weather is on news talk five sixty K O we are\n[laughter]\n[laughter] they're in a dorm room and board is by me along with the um bring them you know Bob Bob and Bob's board we talked\nEarlier with him about his life and how we seem to have this war and how we inherited it from his great uncle and you were saying also that\nAh you know you have a young but you said you have kids who affective disorder\nAnd and you said and I was talking with a friend of mine and she was telling me about how some people when they're touched by mental illness some of them believe that they they'd been touched by the spirits in other words they have just open contact at all times\nAnd I was just curious if you know you said you use the board and you said you had contacts with friends who have passed do you believe that outside of the use of the board that perhaps you get messages are you sometimes get word from either friends who have passed or maybe even some of the victims of Bob\n[noise] I think you know the the main thing they say when you in schizophrenia is that if you have it as a child that's the worst kind and I didn't have it as a child and so I didn't get it wasn't until later that\nThe doctor you know a number of them said that I had to affective disorder which is um characterized by a lot of depression and and kind of seeing elusive nations of things [noise]\nBut if you have if I'm On my medication it's not that serious with me so I can blame it all on that you know and I I I just couldn't tell you my intuition\nIs that it really is working 'cause I've I've talked to people I mean I I had I put it this way I had some celebrity people\nCame to talk to me personally you know and I I'm just ... I'm just an average person\nBut I had some celebrities talking and they wanted the board and one lady who who son committed suicide had the board and she ... originally the board was just\nThe same image but I put it on would ... with glue you know what I made a color copy ... [noise] and so I Would in a lot of people in Los Angeles used it in one very famous actress\n... son had killed himself and she reached out to us meaning me and my friend and I sense as a board and she said that she had spoken to him repeatedly and thanked me and she's a very famous she's dead now I can mention of you if\nYou don't you go ahead who was [noise] was she was from that Dick Van Dyke show Mary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet very kind Rosemarie no she was Mary Tyler Moore\nOh Mary Tyler Moore was on the Dick Van Dyke shattered show on her own show who's retiring more now\nBut she was very she was searching for ways to communicate\nAnd just understand so it is it's so in other words what I'm saying is it's not just the evil you can you can deport all is it you know the channel would you want I think Bob [noise] was naive and he put\nHe put this together to talk to his victims and then you realize they're going to come and they come back\nAnd haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point in my grandpa was it was it was in one day and then a month later he was in another town another town and then it caught up to them and that's I think that's why he just and he killed himself he drowned himself\nAnd his body was never found\nNo but he turned my he sent my grandfather a note I saw the note and it was typed because he never would write in freehand bomb number wrote anything down and he would type it or you stencil and\nWouldn't be where was his last words in the letter\nHe said that he can't take it anymore because of the the the stress that he's being haunted he said he made a mistake by making the board and people were haunted him that he is hurt and then he he went into it was a Jersey beach town\nAnd walked into the water he said he was going to do it anyway and the letter and no one ever saw him again so my grandfather who was a much healthier a man like a stable man and he loved he loved Bob for all his faults and he said that\nBob had a weird way of telling the truth about certain things to he convinced that he walked into the ocean and it was in December [noise]\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms

ingenuity but he said that he will hardly think I shall meet the test is power disclose the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into the into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also ... is in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the we used to board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada\nBought some rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage war makes it a prominent splash into the market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moves it was going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we ... is a trademark path of the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making a board or basically feel that it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself\nOr what have you ah in his own special way\nI'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make around and start customizing assign um\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nUm and it's I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a circular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if it'd be tricked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution\nI mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted and you have any information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\nWell which is kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on would just put the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy\nUsed to work for ... which is an old TV show or\nOn the which was on like channel five or something right in the east and um she was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like um show it to like producing I think mhm on current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level like the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put it on more quality thing with boxes and everything you know\nIn the background to run the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they put it down\nSo they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut I'm the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know got to I I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old because this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary\nAnd if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody it was called go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back to shape it a shot a joke ...\nNo I'm In I Want to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time was beyond as a matter of used to board\nA gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they use it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean I you know boards rudimentary like that even even\nWhen you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you board and Christmas tree lights so that her little boy you can go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really do need ports do we care and I mean even the boards of bear or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into battle to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own\nSix cents ... he started developing really started really being fine tune\nAnd taken aboard a way I can still do this work and pay a lot of people use and the old days they used typewriters [laughter] word processors now that you've computer keyboards and they've channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board with people if the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up your receptor so you could start bringing in the information right and so again I Want to be real clear the board there's no negative energy is with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home something I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen\nUnless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that's my desire or that's how I view the world so people deserving people scared us even talking about this on the radio while I have\nAre though they they they bring in the they don't understand and and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation or they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them ... motor responses are that are basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions and the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters and so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the borders you say it's like a permission slip but it's like a way to to view I mean people would use pencil that I I used to know a media embed would\nOr would he would do his thing he would just scribble\nHensel and he would just scribble on a no bad scribbling scribbling that'd be scribbling for some reason we just doing the scribble he's looking at what's going on all I see a scribbling but what I said what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of doing something with his hand\n\nAnd\nEh you know\n\nA chip ice
