I. D. A. L. W. A. V. E. dot net\nOkay that's a RV I as a tidal wave one word dot net right All right and uh you answer your email I take it\nYes you know it I can guarantee I keep up a if I have if I get inundated but I Do my best\nUh well uh you're going to be inundated believe me what projects or it in the remaining moments here what projects or have you all taken on after the military I take it you're leaving the national security stuff behind now are you probably had enough of that sink a ship\nA gift or maybe you do you I don't know um uh but uh but so what are you doing now\nThis is Joe I'm I'm a research associate still with the cognitive science as well that was the original abacus awry and then later as I say I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a\nUh some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research from behind and we hope to continue pursuing the mechanisms behind ... doing\nCan you talk about it at all I mean I Am for example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time I'm with national security work uh uh you know Congress and oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nOr we we're of course it see a sellout are the kind of the science was lab has never endorsed uh espionage of any kind of were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports I function [noise]\nWe've recently done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have\nIndicated that we may be on the something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and if those prove out which we have every reason to believe they will uh there'll be some very astounding a findings that will uh open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier cells\n[laughter] every column titled chose scares me enough uh I\nI Am [noise] ah no longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed\nBy it I Would agree with that statement\nIs it one of those things that once you have big gun uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was involved in the government program or otherwise who has said this is lousy I'm I'm I'm bored or on on the interested I'm not doing it any more is it one of those things that once you've done you will always do\nA this is Joe I'm it's I I always tell people that if you are if you wanted me to sell my experience in this for ten million dollars I probably wouldn't do it [laughter] however if you offered me ten million at the beginning to do it\nAnd then I knew what I knew now I probably wouldn't participate\n... I guess and yeah that's a good answer that's really a good answer All right well we're about out of time anybody uh want to issue any final words here um I of course would love to have you back at some future point um but any any final words for the American audience is intensely interested in this whole thing you've been doing\nWell it's like Paul I'm\nSuddenly somebody else wants to say something too but um I I think there's a very exciting a process I think it's very exciting time to be involved in this and the and I'm Glad that people are interested that kind of been the case what we were doing in secret for so many years so I encourage people to develop and interest\nAnd the export and find out about it\nSo in other words uh go ahead folks if you're interested follow it\nThat's that's right Joe this joke I I just want to add one thing for you know after um I Would encourage people to retain their skepticism\nAnd to ask questions it's it's okay to challenge whoever's doing this and and have them explain are open to review and criticism what exactly does that they're doing uh that's that's where knowledge has developed and\nIt's how we decide whether something is truly valid or not so I Would encourage continued interest but to be skeptical and ask question\nWell you know somebody might likely say and we've only got a few seconds All right I Want it instead of demonstration you know arts holding up something tell us what it is not is not the kind of thing that remote viewing lends itself toward is it\nThat's that's correct this is Joe I'm I I've actually done six lied remote feelings on camera for national a national television and anyone\nIn America and uh one of the requirements has been that they stabbed Bush and follow very closely the protocols in in those performances have have an open to review and criticism\nAlright Joe ...
