didn't do any research on I'm thinking well I Want to do research on this I Want to find out more can't find a damn thing\nSo last night\nI don't know if I'm any of you know this but there was a full worldwide shutdown of YouTube last night\n\nAnd I got an email from a guy named Scott ... emails me all the time and he kept mentioning this story about or have you seen this video this video is going around the Internet this video of a guy he's in a uniform even military and you say that something is about to hit the moon\nSome large object is about to hit the moon well apparently\nThis is the this is a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy theory cause I cannot confirm it so it's a conspiracy theory meaning that since I Can't confirm it but it's weird that I think I'm having some sort of a mental breakdown or something I don't know what's going on here but um there are rumors flying around as to why the this this this this outage occurred\nLast night\nAnd the chief rumor is that viral video\n\nThe viral video of a guy something on YouTube relief that purporting to show a man\nIn uniform announcing that something\nLarge he didn't asteroid a rock a UFO I dunno something large was about to crash into the moon\nAs I said I was notified by email and Scott if you're lifting please send that email again I Want I Want to know if you said that email too because I read your email sometimes they don't reply to them but I read your emails and Scott you know who you are I'm Talking right to you\nI Want to know where that video is about man or that that footage of something hitting the moon because from what I understand is that they shut down YouTube\nLast night they shut down YouTube last night because of that video\nThey didn't want that video to go viral slated to shut down the system see they won't tell anybody way the system shut down and just shut down because they wanted to weed out any and all of these videos going around that would show something hitting the moon\n\nNow if I Can't find proof of this\nAnd I can't find a video or if I Can't find the story about the armada and the stark clusters and the Russians and the art the story\nIt all sounds like some science fiction misinformation\n\nAnd maybe got leaked out it wasn't supposed to be heard or touch their ... or or thought about right so\nThe science fiction it's information maybe maybe some history to play a joke on people\nBut [noise]\nI mean\nIs it really or was it really science fiction this information really because of the circumstances it just seems a little odd Russians say they see the star cluster say but they don't want to start clusters they look like do you remember me saying this then you may remember me saying this on the air\nSo I was talking about the neutrinos coming out of Antarctica right and I said oh\nAnd now they're saying that Russia is sad to see Santa Claus there is a looked like our motto UFOs blah blah blah blah blah you remember I said something about that haven't been able to find that\nQuote [noise] but I have a friend who said you did say it okay I didn't say it\n\nI said it and then the shutdown of YouTube and a mysterious email not really mysterious as a guy who sends me emails all the time saying that he saw video in fact I Want to check my email the series on this year to see if he wrote me back I Want to find out if he's listening to me if he's writing me back immediately\nUm see no he hasn't written me he has not\n\nSomebody sent me some better rushing star cluster [noise]\nNo that's not in jail thank you and this is

S. S. according to a statement that was released by NASA but\nSo use every ten spacecraft watch from about can or cause of drumming Kazakhstan to the international space station for forty ... am eastern daylight time\nThursday October eleven\nOr carrying American astronaut Nick Kagan Russian costs not Alex C o inching\nShortly after launch there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted resulting in a ballistic lending of the spacecraft\n\nBut launch appeared to be going smoothly but about Ninety seconds later NASA on his live stream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation the space agency tweeted the ballistic descending above the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the castle containing the aspect successfully separated from the rocket booster\nAnd parachute into the ground with the rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back but that\nShawndra X ray observatory when did the same boat and halted all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope\nShut down due to a gyroscope failure\nAccording to the agency ... a transition at the same boat was possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with this gyroscope\nComponent in charge of pointing and stabilizing telescope however there are some investigators and those were into deep space conspiracy theory they're saying that something is happening in space that NASA does not want us to see\nAnd and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover it's temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so we can't see anything from Mars\n\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bulletin\nThey haven't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination ops are offices two year old a two year old the organization that NASA's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to overnight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination office\n\nFirst of all there was Ninety million dollars with no sixty million dollars it went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight and says you're amid growing concerns of humanity is utterly unprepared for the unlikely but still an ... an asteroid strike of calamitous proportion the White House has also recently\nIssued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan intended to energize a host of agencies who could contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we have nothing to concern about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars\n... white issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize the host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something is that right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary B horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario it sounds\nToo weird to be real but it is real it's happening I mean these these shutdowns I mean remember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September ... twenty eight team and then all this stuff is good chicken shut it got to remember all the other space observatory the shut down after the September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before an alien invasion well he's from a science fiction perspective I mean and I I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I guess it all depends how you look\nAt what is going on around you and everything around us is is is it it it just it sparking a lot of anxiety I was really really bizarre all day today a lot of tension in my neck a lot of uh I I couldn't concentrate\nAround the moon um do you get up\nAt you know there was it\nYeah it was weird and I you know you get when you look at the shadow the mowing the light side the dark side where it was just started I which I couldn't figure out it was stored actually looking at it looking at looking at all and I when I got closer towards the western part of the United states\nUh it was it cleared up and the owner was\nVegas how I mean I could see it that I you know I shut my day off I stopped and\nTurned myself off but uh that's up throughout the light\nFrom the Chinese like following

they're saying but nothing happened to the moon the and build their well they do you see this little light headlight like being in the sky and the ... the\nFootage that I was seeing from a genetics army with something far more compelling and that if something cropping would infrared that'd be that night vision\nAnd you could see it pass on the moon it was amazing so something did happen last
