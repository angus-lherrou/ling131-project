British resale standpoint okay\nAnd um you know if you do that you're going to get similar growth in value to what you would in a single family in that same neighborhood\nSame families to do a little bit better there's a little bit more market for them and there is condos but you know uh if you're in an area that's accepting of condominiums you'll be fine in Vegas will be fine with that now having said all of that then the only downside is what you mentioned earlier\nAnd that is the H away and the handling of the budget of the ... I wouldn't want to investigate because you are a planner the budget\nAnd um how they're doing with the H away budgeting let me give an example I had a condo come I own a rental or a many years ago in a condo complex that they had budgeted no reserves to replace the roof\nOkay now the condominium association is responsible for the exterior maintenance which would include the roof replacement so they come up with a several million dollar problem because the roofs are going bad\nRight and they done no planning to get rid of it so guess what they did a special assessed every body and the place in addition to the right way fees to keep because they had to have Ruth ... Lincoln all over the place\nBut that devalued the condo in both took cash out of everybody's pockets okay and so if you look up and they've got no reserves for parking lot replacement no reserves for X terrier maintenance no reserved for roof replacement in their budget\nAnd you know and you're looking at a complex is ten years old you got a problem you're walking into and so that is the thing you want to look at their the deferred maintenance is hidden down in that age I weigh reserves budget\nThe second thing you're going to run into is a and I'm In a bunch of ... owned a bunch of real estate I hate H always right generally speaking the people that want to be on in charge of the ... way or the people that are in charge of nothing else anywhere else and their Barney fives\nThey would drive you freaking nuts absolutely and there are people that need a life\nNow there's exceptions to that but by and large or you're going to run into a lot of that\nBut yeah I'm currently currently live at home or the ... right now and I'm the president of the U.S so [laughter]\nBasically [laughter]\nI stayed at our you know I\nI stayed at the typically because I didn't want to run into a firefight kind of situation very guy\n[laughter] okay [laughter] right well God you say\nYeah there there's a lot of that it's not it's not a hundred percent truth thank goodness I hopefully ... you know and I don't know that at all [laughter]\nBut that's what you want to watch for is the politics of the association I'm In one eye choice of Sarah suing each other and it's just on the whole neighborhood just melting down you know just ridiculous so you just hit it you got to\nMatch what you could get into you if you're the president so she has she already knew all the stuff I was just talking about them as far as I'm even reserves in a home\nSituation things there that you've got that have reserved\nPreserved covered [noise] so [laughter] that's all you gotta look for [laughter] that's fabulous Ramsey show [noise]\nHey guys this is James child producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on the hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you and Dave Ramsey dot com last show\n\nChrist will come here you ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire is impossible these days\nOr people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families will we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and the simple truth is everyday people become millionaires all the time\nHow did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently and with the help and guidance upper professional\nThat's why our team has already done the hard work for you\nWe've vetted and interviewed thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals get started today go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart dresser and look up the smart buster pros and your area\nThat's a big Ramsey dot com slash smart buster and be sure to check out my brand new book\nEveryday millionaires it's available for pre order start in August seventh\nUse whether in sports for now he sexes online and on the air news on five sixty hail vi home I I hardly radio station [noise]\nXenon clue design lead sound like ...
