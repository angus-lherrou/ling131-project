{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "How old are you are I'm twenty seven now how long you been married five years you all had this discussion about the way your feeling about this check yes absolutely what he's trying to\nLose any we uh we just need to pray about it and figure out what what most wise decision\nWhich I how much of the check for\nTwenty seven five well that pay off everything\nI'm not quite but we do have a five hundred and savings or we could take a I think maybe the ... of that and be done with everything\nEverything but the house yeah OK yeah good and then begin your emergency fund ... who passed away my grandfather okay All right\nWell there's a couple of gauges we want to do a number one we want to be biblical wise which is what she was saying and pray about this and the number two we want to do something with his money that your grandfather would be sitting in heaven and so you're doing this and smile\nOddly enough these are actually the exact same things\nUm because when you start doing more things with money that's going to be honoring to his memory in other words right there and so paying off the debt would not make him mad as long as you had a process to never go back in and that's what bothers you a little bit so what I Want you guys to do is I Want you to go back through financial piece university\nAnd I want you to heart this money in a side savings account that is not attached in any way to an ATM card debit card or your checking account where you can't do it without a ... to the bank\nOr you have to physically go down there and make it hard to get to\nAnd parking there for nine weeks until you go through the clash us together you've got the one year membership I'm going to pay for it for you to go to financial piece university okay\nAnd attributes university is a one year membership you've got nine lessons in nine weeks you've seen some of them some of them have been re done since you saw them and ah you go through those\nThen when you get done with that I think you'll know what to do and you take that money and work the baby steps but uh the problem is as you said the get out of jail free card if you don't change your behaviors\nAnd have something more than just a promise to yourself you're going to straighten up then you could really cause a problem lighter um yeah and so what you want to do is\nProved to yourself during this nine weeks that you have changed your behaviors and when you are looking at each other going okay we're really doing this we're not screwing around were not goofing off we're not going to issue\nWe're really going to do it no itching Dave ... financial ... ish wise ... we're not going to ... and so that'll get you into a mess I and so you know I Would if I knew I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do this up\n[noise] and that's what I'm telling you to do\nA is so go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd on and stay you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go to the legacy journey class online\nOr you can you can get into groups on line and stay you know should continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus we'll connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that um we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff though\nAnd that's a really really really incredible value and uh it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this and\nSome day when you're doing really good find the guy who um feels like a product and you help him out and that's why I'll ask you to do things for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a newer ... forgive me for my ignorance um [laughter] I and a database that we have our I'm Out in our savings that are currently working on our we have about thirty forty thousand dollars on the net and quit their car if we do not have a mortgage we currently rent now my question is\nUm we're going to have it paid off work and the next few years\nMaybe even a year right now we have a plan that we want to take our children and to an RV for about two years and travel the country however we would have to\nFinance ticket Harvey and something to tell us when we feel like kind of have to ask them to her kids are getting older\nI'm her we would\nNot like to wait if possible but I just wanted to see what your advice for America would be\nA snake dream I like having the dream that's cool very cool well I'm not going to I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money off on broke people\nRight and um and if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people have you ever tried to sell used RV and other people\nAre running mode jak possible to get rid of them are they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels motors they are mathematically horrendous\nOr they're just a mess and so um the other the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd a show you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nI'm sixty thousand\nOkay I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an RV that would um\nThat was her five for the two year period of time and then if you saw what it is somewhat of a lost at least you got you know what I mean dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have and you finance it you're going to turn it into a nightmare\nRight it's going to cause a problem for your family 'cause I mean you put a hundred grand an RV by the time you get home is worth fifty right\nAnd you're going to be stuck and ... all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement I mean it it could be disastrous if you're doing this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or to look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and just turn it back in\nA doubt there is one they're probably very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is a different\nUm and when you add all of this up it might be\nThat you guys could stay in your you could travel in your car um or your issue be or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you add it all up\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on the transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want your dream to be a nightmare so do it with no debt you do it used to\nAnd um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you got some nights to do that while you're working to get your other debts paid off right now\nAnd then if you want to say about fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand ... or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm going to be mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life\nBut if you if you just go write a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess kiddo and I don't want that for you I Want you to win

swearing in for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh at the White House despite\nAnd she was there for me and ah she did everything she could to support me so I wanted to pull my resorting to support her and so that's why\nI'm a fourth of July I came to the office and I put together a go from me page for her and if you've been to the Facebook page you see the Janine is there and\nI tell the story as to why and how we came to this and the general support that was already been pouring in for Janine he's amazing and I'm so thankful and grateful and Janine even since her love and thanks for all of the prayers and all of the support and ah we do have a goal but\nWe're going to try and see if we can surpass that goal because that would give us more incentive to at least get some more things been checked that she can use to get better quickly um in in\nWhat we're doing is we're we're literally having to\nPlan ... kind of been a two month way or how to get around all the things that we need to do financially to get out of the situation we're in it and we're still of course paying on my\nMedical bills from my cancer still or because of mine was a little more expensive for her is of course we can cover now because of the fact that you know\nTime you know you're able to meet financial goals but we were coming up short so I wanted to ask anyone out there if you could to go to the go find me pages on my Facebook it's also you can see it on my uh\nGround zero site you can go there and take a look at that and if you can help contribute to helping my wife and Liam too you know we keep the family together and and that way we can we can still\nYou know well to provide help to the family\nAnd it's hard to ask 'cause that's why I'm having a hard time trying phrases because you know I'm dealing with a lot of things right now behind the scenes\nAnd\nIt's just it's so good and I'm gonna tell you this from my heart is so good\nTo know\nThat your loved in that people support families [noise]\n[noise] so that's why I'm going to say about that and um it does my heart good with all the madness in the world [laughter] there are a lot of good people out there to listen to my program\nA lot of good people they're looking out from a beautiful wife Janine\nThank you thank you so much Janine says thank you too\nSo I'm gonna I'm gonna let this go just go to my go fund me page I put out for Janine help us out please I really appreciate that very much\nAnd I show is a is going to be a mind bender for everybody and the reason why it's so fun subject for me ah you know one of the weirder aspects\nOf quantum mechanics could be explained by an equally weird idea but I've always talked about and that's retro causality we're talking about causation that\nRuns backwards in time but then it can also run forwards and time Feinstein came up with the idea of spooky action at a distance quantum mechanics he said that's how you can theoretically explain or\nBring about evidence to show that retro causality exists which is the particle equivalent of you getting a stomach ache today things to tomorrow's bad lunch\nAt the idea that\nYou got a stomach ache but there was nothing that you ate the gave me the stomach ache but something that you're about to eat is going to give you the stomach I does that make any sense\nI don't like explaining it that way that's kind of a waste science would explain I like explaining it as for example you're at a bar or somewhere like a like let's say that a guy sitting in a bar and the woman comes up to him and\nSays I Want to marry you and they want to marry you on this date so you set a date when the marriage is going to happen right you set a date for that\nAnd uh and she says but there's one thing you need to do you need to cut your hair you shave your beard and you get yourself a suit and tie and I want a house okay\nSo you're thinking okay I'm going to marry this woman and this is what I got to do and you don't even know if it's going to happen you\nJust do there is a date set ahead and that that future date is going to be affecting the president in the past okay so they passed after you you know after president goes away and continue using continues so vinyl you do go to the day and you find out that\nAll this stuff you prep for was retro causal\nOkay so you're you're preparing for something that may not happen but it's happening it's it's because the futures influencing president passed in in that way which is you know a simple way of explaining it probably not\nIt's probably too simplistic maybe but that's that's the way I see it as the way it works this is causality you know there's cause and effect but what effect happens before the cars and that's something that's hard for science to grass although there is a pair of physicist right now from you from a from the United states and Canada\nThat actually took a closer look at some basic assumptions in quantum theory undecided unless we discovered time necessarily rent one way measurements made to a particle could echo back in time as well as forward\nSo we have kind of a shadow or an echo in transit pretty much are we all know quantum mechanics is is weird right we we know that part of that we're just comes down to the fact that at a fundamental level\nParticles don't act like solid billiard balls rolling down the table but rather like a blurry cloud of possibility shifting around the room now\nStephen Hawking that told me all about this when I met him long time ago when we were discussing Heisenberg and uncertainty principles and Adams and and\nAll kinds of other you know weird particles moving about and we're talking about the blurry cloudy and ... and and the blurry cloud comes into sharp focus will be tried to measure particles meaning that we can\nOnly ever see a white ball hitting a black one into a corner pocket but we can never see the countless white ball sitting by balls in every pocket okay we can have we can face forward okay and we see everything in front of us right at our feet\nBut behind as there are so many possibilities going on behind the so we don't even if we take a look back\nWell she what's going on but with our back turned there are so many things are happening that we don't understand\nWhy we can't understand it all at once otherwise our brains would explode\nSo this is all about and maybe this might happen this could happen All right so when we're dealing with maybe he's in what is\nI mean these are these are all part of a of causal progression it's all part of the trends that the ... the transient move whether it's an echo or whether it's cause and effect whether it's a fact before cause whether or not you're going and loops so have you can prevent me just a minute\nThese ... these clubs or maybe he's represents something very real possibilities on a positive level can be very real see that's why I don't like the idea that you know we're all feeling like we're doomed to some fate\nWhere everything falls apart and collapses I mean some some reasonable in that mindset when there's always hope for something to go better\nWe should always try and focus on that hope that things are going to go better you know what I'm saying so if if if if this represents something real up all the particles are like bouncing around and we don't see the possibility is behind this but we only see what it was in front of a sometimes we can't even see behind beyond our own feet\nSo this is just a convenient representation of what can happen [noise]\nTime goes by time goes back

[noise]\nTrouble lazy seven three thirty seven\nRetro causality has always been one of my topics to favorite\nOf mine because it it it's always kind of weird to think that yes maybe something in the future could influence the past or vice versa and I and I started thinking about that back during the nine eleven days seriously um it was because of the fact when nine eleven happened I just felt like time stopped\nAnd I felt like that there were some things that happened during that that that era that reminded me of things in the past the quite possibly were affected by that very moment in time I I and I don't know why my brain went that way\nBut it just happened to go that way for some reason\nI mean when you're in the round the fringe analytics or like saying that it's better that conspiracy theory we should start using that right were fringe analysts [laughter] I like that idea rather than say you're a conspiracy theorist you're fringe analyst and that means you analyze everything that's fringe including paranormal unfair political\nBut uh in the realm of fringe analytics and and being a fringe a analyst there's a whole lot of maybe using coincidences that should never be ignored even when they sound outrageous\nAnd so when I played that audio just now the broadcast the man on the tape\nOr the man on the radio back in Nineteen forty five he could have made a lucky guess right but I'm a sucker for time travel would prophecy especially when it has that paranormal vibe to it and how would lead you down the roads that take you to what's called the further beyond\nSee modern conspiracy theory there is a notion of predicted programming\nAnd we talk about this all the time as it seems to be a pervasive way to approximate or otherwise for structure the future in some way\nIt is proposed that through what is called revolution of the methods that were warned or were\nBeing prepared to accept certain ideas means er ideologies\nWe see it in film and TV shows so many things that eventually come to pass but we see like for example I don't know about you but if you if you go on the Internet a lot you see The Simpsons predicted a lot of things even even the nine eleven attacks even predicted the election of Donald Trump which I think it's fascinating\nSo when we see these things happen and we wonder about retro causality we wonder how these people who are in the arts can somehow\nPredict the future or at least give us something to think about in future tense like science fiction I remember I was at a uh a convention one time\nIt was a convention and we I was on a panel discussing just what science fiction writers got it right there was this one science fiction writer that I was sitting there so I didn't know who he was he was a local\nScience fiction writer ... science fiction is never gotten it right and I said I beg to differ man I says you write it you write science I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away got right for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he got allows surprise um and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation of the method it's a it's a very deep\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to\nThe fantastical concepts and most

side\nDoes it have to be scientifically ... verified it was just a production of the future's all it is no\nI'm a Nineteen forty five I mean it's just it was from a pax TV they said it was made in England in Nineteen forty five post World war two and it's just somebody predict future having team forty a Nineteen forty five a hundred years in the future twenty forty five\nAnd that's something that you found on the Internet\nIf somebody was produced it was something that was a released by a pax TV or the England that was a prediction given ... an ounce or on the radio in Nineteen forty five\n... okay\nAnd I mean I mean it was ... it was kind of attitude about it but not really all that accurate right\nWell right\nAnd what ... what do you what's the problem you have with it\nJust because I mean anybody could make\nThat's right anybody could make the production of if this was made in Nineteen lives if this was made in Nineteen ... sixty five and it it was still buy\nA month ago\nWell it did it they say was Nineteen forty five so I mean if it's Nineteen forty five and they say it's Nineteen forty five and the group is called the effects TV and they said they had that from Nineteen forty five I mean I I Can't really get something Arthur's Dick Clark made in Nineteen sixty four they basically said the same thing with this set\nI I read Nineteen eighty four I regret that\nRight well okay so Nineteen eighty four was made what in the Nineteen twenties and Orwell that much predicted the future did he not\nWrite write questioning the soundbite that you played if it was late last month right that\nWell okay let me just tell you this it was released by a company called apex TV\nSaying that it was an unknown radio broadcast from Nineteen forty five a man was on the radio basically predicting the future and that's all it is I mean you can quiet and I do that of course you can anybody can I don't understand what your problem is my\nProblem is I don't think that the clip you played was originally from Nineteen forty five\nOkay and when do you think it was from\nI Wonder why I think that's probably\nYeah when you when you think that was paid I mean I I don't understand what you don't know what the problem is with this I really I'm really wondering what problems\nLike somebody made it look like this person from Nineteen forty five was saying that but it was really made last week\nOkay so how much how much of that thing that he how much of that recording was that guy accurate about\nWell I Know that's\nNo no I'm asking not very much of it was not a ... I mean what he said that ah there'd be a lot of entertainment that wouldn't be owned by a lot of companies that's not true we have we have companies that own a lot of our entertainment there are independent or things that he's half right about he didn't get it all have a lot a lot of that production stuff wasn't All right he didn't get to\nGet it All right [noise] yeah it play it again and again I Want you to review it again and realized that [noise] while the Gulf when he got some of it right he didn't get all of it right you didn't\nKnow it is not what he said it was saying the validity of [noise]\nOkay [noise] All right well your question you have a little bit of it but I don't understand why it's so important [noise] I mean if if they said it was Nineteen forty five and find them you question the validity of it but it's like this guy really I mean when you think about it\nHe said it might not all of it was true then he said I mean we didn't really wants to know what he had to say that\nKind of the point is they [noise] uh hope is something that looks kind of real but right and who benefits from it so\nI think it's a [noise] like people who benefits from the hopes mark here longer fear there was nothing fearful in that in that broadcast [noise] nothing [noise]\nFamous ... war the world it's\nNo little really not [laughter] [noise] I'm going to play it again the next hour I don't know if you heard the ride broadcast or not I don't know if you were really lifted scary about it at all or nothing but they're listening to you know I've never called a radio show okay but I'm just trying to figure out who benefits from folk singer radio broadcasts like that\nWho hosts the war of the world who [noise]\nWho ... okay we know why or sin well did that we don't know why anyone would want to think something like that I'm going to play it again next hour we'll see we'll be back [noise]\nHis online banks for closing on how they even have documents fries signed for home equity loan only I didn't what and\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on line where these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer\nI Know about title fraud so I register with home title walking discovered some they've had already taken over title thank God I found out on time no\nBank identity theft program or insurance protects you hope title lock will for pennies per day hold tight lock puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on it helping to shut it down\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free with sign up this at home title lock dot com\nHome title luck dot com station he was whether in sports\nFor South east Texas online and on the air news on five sixty Kaomi I home I I hardly do you\n\nTake the oath again I Lisa ...

an audio file becomes from apex TB okay a apex TB claims bet this radio filed a replay you comes from Nineteen forty five\nAnd I put\nIt it in some guy called last Saturday says oh it's a hoax and I'm thinking well okay if it's a hoax and who benefits from it that's what I Want to know who benefits from a hoax\nIf this is a hoax it just sounds like a typical guy on a radio making some predictions is all it is and so I don't know why this guy which is so hung up on the idea of the things I thought it was a hoax but\nWhat I Want to do is want to play you this broadcast the man who's been recorded off the radio could have made a lucky guess\nBut I'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has the paranormal by to it so I'm gonna play this for you again and ah there's no fear mongering here at all even though the guy said oh this this is this is the intent is to scare people know this is not to scare people but it's here to make you think\nListen to what this guy says like I said Nineteen forty five it's a radio broadcasts where a guy attempted to actually predict the future what would happen in the year twenty forty five here we go\nTo the gentleman welcome back in the program today without that can talk about a rather serious topic for a child and they can make some protections maybe someday I'll find them back on such protections they yeah as you know his Nineteen\nForty five hundred years from now only twenty forty five it is difficult to imagine the state of the world and one hundred years sounds we have seen before the world has changed drastically and the last one hundred yes just one hundred years ago\nAnd the year ... the concept of self power frying machine seemed as ridiculous an identity evidence and many that's great and the ... revolution\nThe well the scene all changed in the fall came to mind as we go over our protections for the next one hundred years then one hundred years of high and put it that men will have stepped foot in front of all the celestial bodies such as the moon and the ...\nOne hundred years I've heard is that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety\nOf sources big companies will no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy\nI sit in one hundred years cause one let alone can be constrained for the crown and we'll have the ability to fight and the average wealth and\nThe energy and that's our cars won't come from the sun and one hundred years at the television sets we'll get increasingly smaller connect the television and sent to the point that they can sit on our\n... and\nThen what is that it will be soon cameras at every street corner they won't be put in place in the name of a safety but our freedoms running increasingly vanish we want to trade our freedom a safety and we want to allow our rights around here because they offer hands tell us and we'll keep our\nChildren are safe now remember these are protections north say maybe some of the future man we're back on the day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting productions if there are predictions that come from Nineteen forty five\nAnd a some of them are accurate some are a little off ... by just a a tad I think but\nWhen you're dealing with something called revelation of the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas\nCertain ... certain ideologies we\nSee in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and when they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality and real time travel is these physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not\nThere are things that shape the past few shaping the past time travel is a fantastic concept in most would consider the stuff of science fiction and yet we hear more and more that\nThe idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually a but to change the course of history\nYeah I don't know I mean we're we're told that there are different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kind of thing I don't know but um it\nIs possible we're hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more\nPossible plausible but um\nThere are those who before us have had insight to see the future or may say they've come from the future to let us do\nYou know through science fiction that time travel is possible in his happen from time to time or time after time or or timing for an item and and that's ... as you may\nKnow like I said I Am in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called tomorrow and there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nAnd what I found most interesting is in the film or they discuss a secret society called plus ultra now according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes\nGood stuff Eiffel\nJules Verne and Thomas Edison at his power apartment to start a secret society of optimist plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity now key members of this group included\nPeople like H. G. wells Ray Bradbury Amelia Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other scientific figures Walt Disney eventually became a member as well so it started\nIn Eighteen eighty nine and there were people who became members of this plus ultra group and what plus ultra was was a group that created a breakaway civilization in another dimension\nOkay so I Know science fiction writer but is there any truth to it that's the question well\nAs we do as we dig deeper into this story okay\nIt says now this is according to the movie fiction this is this is the story tomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine had an expansion at Disneyland was actually about and this is what they said in the film that tomorrow land was actually a training facility\nFor future societies future members of societies they were training them for a journey to an alternate universe\nAnd at this alternate universe was found and later developed by plus ultra\nNow the blueprints for the expansion he'll keep technologies that enabled the journey including something called the super transport key VIPs were encouraged to join plus all trucks were given special VIP audio chores tours of the world's fair\nOr the attraction there there was Ford's magic skyway there was the it's a small world world ride and for those who couldn't attend the fair there was a there was a record player or record\nThey could play to get information about the details now Walt Disney had the it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen sixty four New York world's fair that believed to contain of portraits tomorrow it\nIn reality does he does have a secret place and it's near the pirates of the Caribbean it's below the pirates of the Caribbean ride it's\nCalled club thirty three it's a private club a club thirty three is not acceptable to the public and it's for exclusive use of its members and is the only location at Disneyland that serves alcohol had an editor clubs thirty three I guess has to press a buzz buzz around an intercom it's concealed by hidden panel and the doorway\nAnd Walt Disney was a young boy\nHe was a member of the demo they society and they sign a quarter and\nSo a lot of people believe that the thirty three is related to the thirty third degree a Scottish right free masonry so\nA fictional secret society that is a dimensional secret breakaway civilization called plus ultra I started wondering is there something like plus old truck that I can present for you tonight\nThat would be sort of a revealing that there may be some dimensional breakaway civilization or there may be some ties to time travel\nYes I can do this and it it is as I was digging through this this ... plus ultra\nIt's Latin for further beyond now I Need for you to remember those words plus ultra because those are the two words that are going to be the ones that are going to unlock the doorway unlocked the key is\nPeter opens the door to weigh the doors of perception of your mind to maybe have you thinking about where we are right now and whether or not there are people in high places that can manipulate the future changing the passes or well said he controls the future controls the past well\nThere maybe a few people [noise] Mitt are these types of plus ultra people [noise]\nA lot of things in his book Nineteen eighty four also animal farm was also an allegory for government changes strange this so we got these visionaries they were in you know the earlier\nThat we're giving us information the earlier twentieth century and also a towards the end of the nineteenth century\nSo yeah people even Charles for would be in that category got Charles sport you've ... you've got a you've got a you know George Orwell just go down the list of all of these visionaries they've seen the future or that they they had a vision of the future that we're all living in today\nSo somehow\nThe future that they saw with the future that what's happening right now [noise] and it was influencing these men in the past [noise]\nTo write about [noise]\nThe future [noise] is that makes sense it's retro causality right so we moved from H. G. wells [noise]\nOkay [noise] to Nikola Tesla and what he did and we're going to talk about Nikola Tesla coming up it's going to get even more deeper and interest because we go dribbling pick Seventy three thirty seven hundred strip all eight six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis ... through the ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nAnd I met Robert ...\nFresh counting all take the oath of office for a second time I ceremony was technically on necessary justice capital I was actually sworn in Saturday Night in the immediate aftermath of the Senate vote but President Trump wanted to see the ceremonial swearing in\nAs a side of the legitimacy of the process and the legitimacy of Brett Kavanaugh factor\nTechnicality the newest Supreme Court associate justice promising in his words to always be a team player on a team of nine a massive storm in the making take famous Florida hurricane Michael may hit Florida Panhandle by Wednesday\nLet me be clear hurricane Michael is a monster storm and the forecast gets ... keeps getting more dangerous\nGovernor Rick Scott says areas north of ... in the north and the panhandle may get a storm\nSearch as twelve cease to swap homes smile\nBoxing\nThank you for making April Colbert insurance agency Bomani enterprise readers choice award winner look\nTail vi resist spotlight featured premier businesses here in South east Texas like world gym but there's a spotlight is her Tuesday mornings in Thursday after news here on five sixty Kaomi I brought to you by Texas regional insurance here for taxes here to stay\nAs seen from American standard bearer dot com studios\nMake bread costs for its toll free at one eight eight eight seven seven you check out our Web site at WWW dot argue with you it dot com bust ... actually do have\nTo get [noise]\nA public service\nMessage brought to you by poor ate the cooperative extension system and the ad council [noise] [noise]\nI'm quite Lewis and you're listening to the best of ground zero please hold all the calls is recorded show [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWhat that is that they can't they can't do that [laughter] no children no\nActually no they can't they can't they can't what time is it\n... it could be the end of the world and you know and and as we know\nThe reality of where we are\nWe know that they will pop one time when you don't know how long\nIt'll last night yeah arming them right now\nAnd the balance [noise]\nAh\nI don't know\nWhy why did I say we are not going to know how\nThey can what time is that they can't they they can't what time is that\nThat\nWe need to talk of dying\nDown down down [noise]\n...

G. wells we talked about how he in Jules Verne according to the movie ... and that several other people have been a wartime Walt Disney was a member\nRay Bradbury was a member Nikola Tesla was a member a Thomas Edison was a member and all these guys had connections H. G. wells negligence led Thomas Edison they all had connections in some way throughout history but Nikola Tesla he was considered one of the most innovative and mysterious band whoever lip\nAnd Jefferson vengeance went far beyond electricity he may groundbreaking discoveries such as wireless radio communications turbine engines and helicopters although da Vinci came up with the idea at first\nI'm just so it was also the inventor of fluorescent neon lights torpedoes and the X ray among other innovations but by the time of his dad\nTesla nearly well he had nearly seven hundred worldwide pat how few days after Tesla died on January eight Nineteen forty three\nHis possessions were seized by officials from the amazingly named government office of alien property\nAbout three weeks after that all of Tesla's things an documents were given a thorough examination by a group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump John gene\nTrump would be uncle of president Donald J Trump Trump sunk goal\nBy all accounts a very accomplished and intelligent man at MIT professor of engineering he helped design X ray machines for cancer patients and did radar research work for the army during World War two\nJohn Gee Trump's analysis of those papers concluded that quote Tesla's thoughts in efforts during at least the past Fifteen Years were primarily about speculative philosophical and somewhat promotional character but quote\nIt not include new sound working with principals or methods for realizing such result\nA lot of people that are fans of Nikola Tesla would disagree with what John Gee Trump said about Tesla Donald Trump on the other hand once referred to as uncle John ah as his intelligence he said uh\nThat his intelligence sort of a voucher for his own genetic and historical pedigree saying well you know I'm a brilliant mind just like my uncle John was a brilliant mind in fact Trump said in one interview according to New York or New Yorker magazine you said my uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear was\nEven nuclear that's what Donald Trump says now this would likely be referring to hydrogen bombs rather than the first nuclear bombs because Trump was born in Nineteen forty six\nAfter the atomic age has already upon is right that would be a timeline friendly right there\nWell Donald Trump also recalled uh the times how his uncle would tell him many years ago about the power of weapons\nIt says plus all true but it's written in the ... way it's P.

Tesla and the possibility of a time\nMachine not only that but you see that plus ultra\nAre on the tiles all over mar a Lago where President Trump is called the king\nThink about that for a moment\nSo what Donald Trump be fully aware of the fact that there were books written\nAbout a young man named\nA barren Trump\nWho was advised by a man named John these are some very interesting synchronous these in coincidences did make me wonder about plus ultra and whatnot plus ultra is a real group it's going to Robert in Ohio Hi Robert you're on ground zero\nBelow ground how you doing you love your show what you're talking about it it another as usual mind thinking situation that you always open the candles can't let the mind begin to think last year or anything else you know I Love that you knew that thank you so much\nAnd let me get started by saying that a person who makes predictions and things like that\nYou know generally person should have a totally open mind on that because one never knows what's going to possibly happen in the future anyway right and this person has come up with the idea that possibly something good because you'll notice what protections a lot of times it says hey there's something good comes up or something bad happened\nActually enjoy one or the other\nAnd ah so you know as far as people predicting things and people who are in the past it protected thing\nYeah that's Nineteen forty five show for instance that you're listening to uh put on there earlier was probably something that was played after World War two and England because the gentleman talking\nAs it sounds like he's anguish and he's just trying to bring hope people make them realize someday there'll be no more face to worry about right yeah so that that's that's what that in my opinion is what that's all about as far as people making production stuff sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad\nMouth all the the secret society now I totally believe that also too as you're saying\nThey alter plus a possibility I don't know I don't know myself personally if ... if there is but with the way the world is today and the way society is today and the way the politicians are in the way everything is in this country is right up there is probably cigarettes are you\nDoing my mind is the you know here we have John Tromp who is a Donald Trump cynical who had all of Nikola Tesla's work you had all these papers and of course a Trump was\nA pretty much a a a big help and grieving X ray machines much of what tests for his work was about and Lawrence Tesla created a depth re a\nBit ah most certainly you know is speculative there but it's like well John Trump said well nothing was found that was a very important but yet John ...\nWent along it became this bit bit and then and then Donald Trump of course at mar a Lago he stays at mar a Lago and this is where he kind of hangs out his resort for all the dignitaries and all over the walls his he's the term plus ultra plus ultra plus ultra\nFrom beyond and it it you know it's just amazing the way that all comes together like that it makes you wonder about are also the ah the story about Baron Trump\nAnd the story about the last president it's just been amazing ah kinda coincidence that all this went down in the Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nWell one thing you'll you'll you'll ... easily find out what secrets are fighting and stuff Clyde too is the fact that usually it's the people that have the money\nBut yeah that's right and if it had been some sort of time travel secret society man that that explains a law professor Robert thank you so much for your call triple a six seven three thirty seven hundred thing about it for a moment is there a secret society that knows about time travel will be back with more don't go in\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what

that day\nSo we have a little bit of predicted programming from Nineteen forty five allegedly okay and predicted programming at the revelation of method is everything that goes into fringe analytics and why things happen the way they do whether it's reverse causality or something else\nAnd the other night I was watching a movie called tomorrow in it was uh in my free movies been and I remember it being a good movie I wanted to see it again and what was interesting about it was it reminded me\nOf well\nA secret society in the film officials secret society called plus ultra and\nA lot of people who are involved with plus all for all these visionaries Thomas Edison and H. G. wells and uh several other people Thomas Edison Mark Twain all having connections in fact they said that even does be was a member of this plus ultra group and I\nThought well that sounds really believable is plus ultra real well\nYes and no okay cause I'm finding out that maybe it's not called plus ultra but it's something else even just the was a part of something called club thirty three to ... he created it was just a special club for some of the people he knew and some very special people and of course\nA lot of people believe that the ... thirty three comes from the thirty three degrees and masonry because this was part of the Malay when he was a kid so plus ultra\nIs there any truth to the idea that maybe plus ultra may be\nSome time travel group for some group it created a a breakaway civilization on some other plane a utopian plane well H. G. wells are as you know\nThere was a movie made about H. G. wells called time after time it was another fictional movie where wells goes into the future to find Jack the ripper and he does so by using his quote fabled time machine and the movie and it's kind of ... cryptic late says H. G. wells married\nAmy Catherine Robbins who died in Nineteen twenty seven minutes as as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel and women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells also claimed that he was a Fabian socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new\nWorld order out he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order would happen but he knew that a new world order was in the works that he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order and the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or a utopia that basically emanates from a global is government there was a ... medical leader that led them and the whole nine yards well\nPrior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War started in Nineteen forty or the world will be brought into a new world order by criminal dictator who ... the war machine and so that actually approximate and what really happened in World War two\nWell then he wrote and several of his books that that there was a shadow government there was looming that this shadow government was\nThere to create a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing it kind of like what Benjamin Israeli said about the British Government\nAnd well well you know he was a visionary we notice and whether or not he was a time travel is anyone's guess I don't know if you ... ... but ... but he according to this movie it was part of the plus ultra program now Nikola Tesla\nIs also\nOne of the guys that within this program this plus ultra program allegedly in the in the Disney movie and of course his inventions went beyond electricity in fact there were some people who believe that he created a time machine but he was the I guess the American equivalent of H. G. wells at the time\nWell by the time of his death\nHe had patented ... about seven hundred things but after he died in Nineteen forty three\nAll those possessions were seized by a government office called the government offices of alien property and about three weeks after they were sees all the tests those things in documents were given a thorough examination by group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump who was the uncle of Donald Trump our president\nBut what's interesting is that you know John Gee Trump said that Nikola Tesla's papers were really amounted to nothing but\nA Trump went on to ah actually create X ray machines tests all was working extra machines inside but he created them and of course Trump Donald Trump always says well I come from a long light of intellectuals and very a genius says like my uncle John J. Trump John Gee Trump he was a genius as well well\nUm what's interesting about all this is is that\nQuestion is what did Donald Trump cynical finding those papers in Nineteen forty three well\nThere's a question as to whether or not just had a time machine\nAnd that there was something about that the era of wells the era of Tesla and ah this this writer\nWho was a science fiction writer his name was Ingersoll lock would unlock wood was the author of a a few books one that raise many eyebrows a couple Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey and another was called Nineteen hundred and then there was the last president\nOr both of the books are in the library of Congress and you can read them but Newsweek did this strange article and twenty Seventeen basically saying that\nThis barren Trump character in this book goes to Russia he gets advised by a character named on and then he goes to the Fifth Avenue hotel in New York and then a Fifth Avenue a hotel or whatever it was it was I think probably the Waldo for story if I'm right\nBasically had some significance as well\nBecause there there were there was that book by luck would called\nAh the last president and in the last president\nThere's a quote from the book is really interesting it's about uh the state of uproar in New York after the election of an outsider candidate said that the entire east side this is from the

future idea's\nBeen around since the time of Jules Verne it's like I said the other night it was Jules Verne\nStarted most of this uh these ideas of going to the moon man in the mood even though she was real men in the moon he I mean there were there were several uh books that wells wrote that were just far beyond any imagination\nAmen to that\nAnd and then in front of their we pass a law and from there we have all of the rumors about what tested was involved with and then we have John Trump who got all of those artifacts from Tesla and was involved with X ray machines and a\nA nuclear stuff before World War two and then of course Donald Trump says well a lot of his intellect and a lot of stories came from his uncle and and then\nWe have this plus old for a story out of the movie
