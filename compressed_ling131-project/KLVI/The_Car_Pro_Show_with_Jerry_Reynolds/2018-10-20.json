over four to where we have an in house life insurance guy we we have everything to fit all the family's needs into customize anything they need\nA like I said we're open Monday through Saturday and you can sit for hearing on two four to five eight four zero and as the villain Williams also the agency\nAnd of course right here in Beaumont or on cardinal drive so local a local agent and a again give give them a call ... insurance needs to talk to them about that one size does not fit all\nAnd there's no simple answers I Know I've had builders that say drives me crazy when somebody comes up to me and says hey how much per square foot ... cost to build a house\nI don't know what do you want in the house so ah you know if you come up and say hey let's see how that goes to ensure my car we probably have to sit down and talk about\nMy vehicle or or my house in what it is I'm looking for a if I have a lot of expensive jewelry or special collections that I'm going to need other policies or supplements for and that's something people also don't realize sometimes\nThere are limits on a homeowner's policy\nMany folks have things that you would never even believe in that home talk to your insurance agent\nAbsolutely uh there's so many things that are can be covered differently in your home that might be a cat number on certain policies to where you know your jewelry or guns or electronics on certain policies are can exceed those limits to where if you have law says you're not going to get all of that back\nAnd we want to make sure you're covered for that even if you're with a different carrier don't be afraid to call us come in with your ... page farmers are State Farm or Geico let's sit down and if you say am I covered correctly nobody will answer the phone and my agency\nAll hit your policy if you're covered curriculum be like hey you have a great policy there's no reason to even ... even keep it up but if you're interested in me a maybe a week and a few things and taking a look at a\nA few other areas to customize it 'cause you don't have this and these questions were asked at the beginning\nThen let me go and sit down and get a quote and see if I can earn your business if not you you have a great policy\nWell in that I think he was the question is questions [laughter] that's the question is questions if I'm coming in and just say oh there's much on the home or whatever and they look up a few things and give me a homeowner's policy versus may be asking me that question hey what do you have in the home\nBut you have some guns do you have electronics is your wife have jewelry\nI Can't tell now there are certain things where I Can't sit here and ride a policy say this is what you need is what you're going to have well\nYes in certain instances hey this is what I was going to write for you I'm going to make sure you covered for this this and this but do you have this this and this you do need to investigate and ask those questions because you're not doing your customer any service to where if you don't ask the question is to protect them correctly when something happens and they're not protected\nIt was your fault you know God Forbid something happens in and you're exactly right drinks well and I've heard this before also\nWell I've got insurance and I [laughter] I if I paid you for that insurance why why why is the insurance I paying for this but again if you set out up front and everybody knows okay insurance is going to pay up to this for this to uncover this covers this\nI've been you make the choice I've never been to your house how do I know that you have a swimming pool with the diving board and a slide and a trampoline that might not be covered and learn policies or how do I know\nThat I remember the gene already a trampoline outta diving board what could possibly go wrong I don't I don't need any liability or but again it's a matter of\nJust talking to the age and the Asian if you're agents out asking questions or something\nThere's something very wrong and you know it's funny a there are policy that don't cover a swimming pool that has the diving board is lots of somebody gets hurt Obama's liability uncover so those are the questions that you know your age and needs to be asking\nInjuries enough I had a pool person oh not too long ago and we were talking about some of the new trends in pools\nAnd the trend is away from diving boards for that exact reason he was the first one to tell me that is if we're making more decorative now and doing all sorts of things but diving boards are not something that most people want anymore because they've\nAgain smart folks have talked to their insurance eight absolutely so again it's it's that conversation having that conversation so you know a ... where you stand on some things and and then you make the choice\nAnd a lot of people don't be timid call your age and I mean no question as a stupid question and it comes to protecting what is under that roofer in that garage asked the question and we will answer for you or if you know if it's not covered what do you need to do what steps are we going to take to make sure it's covered you know that's what we're there for\nJust a couple of minutes left but another important thing that people may not realize he's maybe I don't own a home I'm maybe I'm reading I haven't apart butter I'm renting a a home\nDo I need renters insurances are insurance available for me and all the contents I've got in somebody else's place\nOh absolutely I mean right now there's a lot of people that can uh you know\nGet a loan maybe to purchase a home so they're renting a home and they might have fifty sixty Seventy thousand dollars in personal property we do have a policies are renters policy to cover just their personal property that covers exactly the same as a homeowner's policy but we're just not covering the home we're only covering the personal\nPrying the person who owns that home his insurance is not or her insurance is not going to cover you know your personal property their insurance will only cover the structure\nBecause sadly and I mentioned that uh my memory was jog but it's sad that two friends after Harvey who learned that the very hard way they were renting a property it flooded and sadly the a person in the home of the owner of the property was fine they realized nothing\nThey had that homeless come 'cause insurance and never enters insurance and if I remember renters insurance I rented for a very brief period of time a few years ago it was dirt cheap\nA very very cheap the minimum we started out as Fifteen thousand but uh the median around thirty thousand for most people and that runs most people anywhere between Eighteen to twenty two dollars a month\nYeah that's what I remembered I didn't ah rent long but if I remembered it was like so cheap that I I couldn't believe there were quoted me that I said are you sure about that so once again probably the price of Starbucks or ah you know a trip to the bar or a trip to the fast food place\nYou one time a month and you're covered because again if something happens we don't ever like to think about anything happening and and I don't know where a man and a half left and people have told me before well I Know what it's like wasting money\nBecause if I don't have a claim I've sort of thrown that money away\nI'm thinking that was the best investment you ever made\nWhile I look at it this way if you have a closet full of thirty she's you can't wear them all the same time you're going to have a pair that you don't wear for at least a year maybe two years was that a waste of money that amount of money if somebody goes instills them or you're going to be mad\nThat is probably [noise]\nPardon me as I sneeze year with a minute ago I had to sneeze a that is probably a great way to look at it because I I Know you've heard that argument too and I always wonder if that's a great way to counter because I I always when I look at them and say well\nOkay you know you were paying for the protection sort of like we pay for health insurance and if I'm held you when you I I shouldn't be angry that while I was healthy all your gosh darn it if only I could have had a dread disease and and collected all that insurance so same thing for homeowners or anything else\nIt's not it's not wasting money when you're protecting your hard earned money for what you've purchased makes sense again how do people reach you can reach me at the ... of that agency had area code for zero nine two four to five eight four zero on sets\nMore there together as if there's the we're tending they're not together yes genesis the luxury brand to Hyundai much lack accurate is to Honda and Lex assist the Toyota except they sell a mostly in the same stores yeah today I was yeah typically\nAre so have the G eighty um that cars been around for a while back from the days when it was a Hyundai and it was just called Hyundai Genesis and I think that's why I keep going back to that but\nThere's a three hundred ... street just smiled today [laughter] although the G Seventy which is the smallest is just now starting to arrive the G ideas right in the middle good sized car\nUm I Would put it on par with the Lexus G. S.\nThree fifty as far as ... goes a BMW five series that mid size you know little larger than a mid sized car but not as big as a full sized car like the gene Ninety which is more\nLike a Lexus LS speaking of size or is that the market\nThe other day and there was an old Honda sitting park next to a new on I mean really old hundred year old under process about twice the nuances about twice the size and it was sitting right next to an our ex three fifty\nAnd link tight with it was almost as big as the arcs three fifty\nYeah that's been the kind of been the trans people because of the SUV\nCrisis going on in America today they want the most for him that that can possibly get\nAnd you know everybody's upside the good news is that had been able to hold their fuel economy right he's the same even though the vehicles are larger and they are ah they're just as fuel efficient if not more than before so\nYeah I mean you used to I used to think of Hondas and tore it as a small cars oh they're not\nNo not anymore\nBut they were at one time that is absolutely correct let's talk to Barbara in Granada Hills California Barbara welcome\nWell thank you for having me health care if I'm gay and I just have a few questions his man looking for\nAnd ... um both of you to ten across and then also a Chevy town in country\nA SUV and I really like that for the ... and I take a lot of small trips and king wheelchair so stuff like that so I Need storage space that I Want to go probably a little smaller than the um [noise] a Chrysler [noise]\nOkay and atlas looked at\nSheets and Honda and Toyota and Honda and I see on the streets and you know I start chicken said that's what I Want that's what they're not sure which one would get that gas mileage and enough storage stay\nHow many people do you typically have with you Barbara\nJust wanted to okay but we have like a ... and you know like I said I Will carry block or two wheelchairs flooded so extra space and how many miles a year do you typically drive on the dash less than what the insurance company will get shipped [laughter] much\nOkay very good I've just tried to trying to decide whether to tell you to do the midsize an issue of\nThe nine thousand and the Chrysler right now about only you know ... ... so I'm going to get so to trade in that the the the SUV that I\nBought for rental place now it turns out there is like twelve thousand dollars for its a load amounts that has to be replaced and it's I just wondering if it's a good idea to go back in time from rental places [noise] I\nDon't typically recommend it and and the only reason Barbara is\nYou don't have the cars been treated you know if somebody buys a car and they know they're going to keep it or at least they plan to keep it for a long time then they typically take good care of it they do they do good maintenance practices and with riddle cars\nTake I take better care of it when I'm renting because I Know it's not mine [laughter] I don't want something that happened to it\nYes and and that's a great that's great philosophy unfortunately that's not the majority of what people think when they were in a car that's what I hear so and the other problem is a lot of the rent car companies do their own body repairs when there's when there's an accident\nAnd magically those don't get reported two car facts and the other's okay you don't really know what you buy a wizard with without the third row seat I Would tell you that I Would recommend the forward edge it is a great SUV a and I think it\nAdds to that with ...

I don't know 'cause I Can't even find contract um but typically I asked her did she do those kinds of things because when she first became disabled I could maybe make them she never buy those things so I'm really not positively sure about that um\nThe dealer that she got it from can tell you real quick a\nAnd it's probably a long shot but that long shots solves all the problems or is there any is there an attorney of any kind of handling the state\nActually I Am the trustee\nYou are the trust and\nYes I Am the trustee that has to make the best financial decisions for her estates and so that

I just took to show because I knew you were at that [laughter] okay I see an ad I'm OK in a few hundred tea\nThat's that's a popular vehicle and how many payments are left on the leagues\nThat what's that other shocking thing I thought it was she had it and it may have two thousand Seventeen um so I think we're at a year\nAnd a half maybe yeah and and\nI was surprised to see how many relating it looks like it was a four year lease\nOr it's possible Lexus us for you is how much is the monthly payment five\nAnd I was I circled arrow around in other words there's this letter I and then around it as a circle but at the end of the circle toward the bottom of the day is an arrow and you hit the button and should turn it off um I\nI used to it now I I wouldn't have a car that I couldn't turn it off but my wife's range rover not drive it quite a bit I had to push buttons START I hit the off on the start stop system and I do it every time and I'm used to it and I don't think anything about it\nAnd the manufacture war you know you you look at me and the tea or you say that I Know you're going to be going out of business but if you or something and they either not local\nIsn't it that manufacture the would be better\nYeah it would actually ah it's going to probably cost more [noise] um but it's good anywhere in the country so the other warranty if you buy a third party more it'll be good anywhere as well but it's just not going to be as easy\nBut didn't want you to the men you know\nThey have nothing to do with each other\nOkay the last well you're in your ... on this late I'm

four hundred dollars in a registration and inspection stickers and wrote and bridge tax that's worth\nOkay and what did that in your same manufacture it going to be the same thing corrected and other large them to get into\nIt if you ... and it depends\nOn where you want the payments I mean nobody's going to require you to put a penny down our beliefs but you're paying interest on attacks if you don't and to you can do with less but just just remember that that four thousand dollars will probably be a hundred and fifty dollars a month and the difference in the ...\nBecause ... every dollar on the shorter term contract like at least every dollar moves that pain but much greater than it does on a six or seven year alone\n[noise]\nOkay so that led up to go back to the lady lady under delete that was interesting I didn't understand that I had been curious about what happened if the person you know the way it\nIt makes me a little or you know how they did that\nThey were the loser by makes no difference the whoever signed for the contract absolutely is responsible and if they are deceased\nAnd they're the only one on that contract and they can go against the state but that's why you

first of all of the year\nWow yeah uh I'm I'm sure hopefully it'll carry over a you know we've seen the team improve every week and they've had some heartbreaking offices especially against uh south eastern in northwestern\nOf and then I finally you know we're able to pull off on us W and you know I think like I said at the end of the post game show at WWNO maybe they've turned the corner now\nAnd maybe we're going to see a different theme coming for it 'cause it's hard to you know it's hard to get over that hill and you know I think they're they're kind of starting to pick out over the hill and let's see what happens tonight because this is a good football team Sam Houston is a really good football team they don't make a lot of mistakes\nThey've always been that way even when I played I didn't make a lot at stake in when they do make mistakes you have to capitalize on a whim our last week you know they forced I don't know how many turnovers and against us W and weren't able to do anything with it they're going to have to do something like that that\nOne other area of them are really needed to improve on defensively third and long for your opponent yes no you've got to get down south\nYeah I'm sure the listeners have heard of you know say plenty of times well this is a big star down a third longest situation you want as a defensive coordinator you know you want a
