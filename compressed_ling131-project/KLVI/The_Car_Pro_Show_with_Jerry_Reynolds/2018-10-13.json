{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "Yeah maybe I Know maybe I don't care maybe it's pretty important to me and I assume mostly go she ate this thing now the clocks running everybody's going to get a chance realtors talking realtors\nA point if I'm the seller one and find the seller would it make good sense for me if I've lived there forever and we were just talking about somebody just knows don't use that bathroom uh do do this but he'd make good sense for me to call you as the seller\nIn go ahead and a half you do an inspection you you mentioned somebody earlier civil I consider this a punch list\nIn essence as a seller before I put that on the market I've got a punch list of some things somebody may spot\nA absolutely um it's not a very popular thing to do around here you know I don't seem to do it but I don't understand why for that money because I get trapped in a last minute deal\nWhere I've got to spend a 'cause nobody ... you can't argue price for the a ... a contractor or whatever last minute suddenly I'm spending a ton of money\nTo correct something are giving you a session of money that I don't really want to have to give\nUs so here's the way I look at it and if I remember looking at the numbers from uh the board of realtors\nOr the average price of a home right now is around a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars okay so you have a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollar house that you're wanting to sell and you're going to be you know you're going to be putting on the market in a month or two weeks from now whatever the case may be\nAnd so you're like ooh okay well let's go ahead and do a home inspection on it you home inspection I come out there and I find these deficient items whatever it may be say it's five thousand dollars worth of\nThe fishing items so we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand ... five thousand dollars worth of efficient items that you don't have to fix [laughter] but what you can do is you can take that home inspection and you can say hey I had the home inspected\nTwo three weeks ago or a month ago and these are the items at the home inspector found\nAnd we know these things but we're we're going to sell the house as it is with these repairs need to be made and we've price the house accordingly to that\nDidn't say you changed it from a hundred and Seventy five a hundred and Seventy [laughter] but you can keep it at a hundred and Seventy five and saying we've priceless house according to what repairs we need we need to be made to his house\nSo let's take another scenario which is the most common scenario you have a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollar house deciding not spend the four hundred dollars to get home inspection done\nAnd you let the ... and the four hundred dollars they come in they get either by five thousand dollars worth repairs and they want to negotiate seven thousand dollars\nOff of the house so now you're stuck do I give them the seven thousand dollars or five thousand dollars to allow them to negotiate off of that price or do I lose the deal off because of this um so now you're kind of in stuck in limbo I'm as to what do you do now\nAnd maybe if I'm the seller I've got it I hear this all the time those market I've got another house that I have an offer on and I need to move along and I\nAbsolutely right um you know you when you have contingencies all the time that people are constantly you know I'm trying to sell this house in moving to the south\nWill get inspected and you can ... you you know it also brings out at trust factor and people say oh I'm Sorry to bring that up to you you've built up trust between you and the bar a run off the bat because most people have what they call soldiers disclosure\nWhich is typically a blank piece of paper that says ... nothing's wrong with your house [laughter] and I'm going in and then when I go in for the bar and I find these things wrong with the house to show how come they didn't put that in the store is disclosing um you know I don't trust them now I don't know what they're what else are they trying to hide from it and\nUm before but things and say hey these items that I found a cash spent four hundred dollars I've now save myself five thousand dollars I'm ... negotiating and repairs of also save myself a headache of renegotiating after that initial contract price\nBecause like I tell people there's three times that you negotiate\nThe original negotiation of the house when you purchase the house of a that's a first negotiation and the second negotiation is after you do home inspection and then the third negotiation point maybe this is just an ill or maybe as if the appraisal comes back and it's not you know not meeting here the price\nSo the third one most likely and they have it happen you know the first one is always going to happen and the second one you can eliminate that by getting an inspection done up\nJust makes perfect sense so I don't understand why people don't do it but\nThat doesn't make a lot of ... because you're right you certainly are losing more money plus again and keeps a trainer the tracks if you're making an offer you have some contingency things happening you're keeping the train all the track to get their\nRight and I mean my thought Molly fought on not doing it is because people are afraid of the truth and the baby are afraid of what is one of the home inspector enough on well guess what I'm going to find it for the bar\nTo these days again most transactions you're going to have a home inspector ... so the buyer will find this out there there may be may be situations out there were fires\nDon't get a home inspection I mean yeah it happened all the time um but\nYou know those are few and far between our our and it's going to be uncovered right and then and then you set yourself up if you don't get the home and ... you know say the person doesn't buy the house and they don't or the person by the house and they don't get a home inspection done and they move in and they find all these things wrong with the house I\nGuess we're setting yourself up for you're setting yourself up for that person that bought your house to come in\nAnd turn around and sue you as the seller because you didn't disclose all this information out oh so you all you got to worry about that nowadays too 'cause we are in a thought about it or they call ... very litigious society that I never thought about it so you do set yourself up for that because you didn't disclose it in the soldiers disclosure\nDoesn't matter that they didn't get a home inspection they chose not to get the home inspection but they're still doesn't matter to the roof\nOr cooling system one of your higher dollar pieces goes out relatively soon yeah I mean if somebody comes in and they discover there is a roof leak well how come you didn't tell me this roof leak whenever I you know before I made a legitimately not no but that's not going to ... well I'm In court I have had people\nThat uh that I personally know that uh didn't have a wind storms or to get on the roof and they live down in ... county and they sold the house no home inspections were done\nAnd something happened to where they finally discovered that there was no one storm ... and they ended up suing them for I think Seventy thousand dollars\nBecause then I ... and there was something wrong with the roof or something like that they could have all been taken care of\nWay up front as a home in space review asked to see this I didn't I don't look for the I don't look for the ones from circus but I Do and foreign people that hey you may want to check and see doesn't have one store to get a lot of relatives are pretty privy\nTo that nowadays Sudan and the salaries should be able to produce that true too but there was a problem with the roof is what I'm trying to tell you though there was a problem with the roof and they didn't

thinking about all I\nGot up at a two thousand that can be as W five thirty five gay at least and that leads is coming to an end in a couple of months or I really liked the car are\nThe only at twenty four thousand five hundred miles on it and I'm just wondering what you feel about that\nThe souls and or should I\nConsider buying it out how can I get the best deal of right now the dealer or without me try to negotiate a basically\nTook five thousand dollars off of the residual but still when I look on line that a similar vehicles I see them or or\nEven under that uh was low violence so and he helped you can provide will\nBe sure I'd be happy to I I tell you the tools\nHave taken a hit because of Volkswagen\nAnd their scandal in what they did and they cheated and in a cheated on emissions and it's hurt every diesel without their Mercedes that's pulled out of bringing diesel to the market to the United states market\nAnd I think people are just overall afraid that you know there's we have the same thing with the with the rent ram a light duty diesels or they were accused of cheating I don't think they did but still it it put a pale over diesels as a whole I think that's that's hurt the diesel market\nYou know there's no need to overpay for your own car you've paid on at three years now if you'd be overpay on it again\nYou know it but if if you love the car you know how it's been treated it and if it's not too far out around\nThen I Would probably say if you love it by it by yourself an extended warranty they'll get you a hundred thousand miles I don't know if you're going to pay cash or finance the the balance of the residual\nA but either way it's okay it's just ... you know I think in my mind Steven a few thousand dollars to buy your own cars fine\nIf it gets more than that then I Would probably walk away from that one and go out into the open market and try to find another one just like it that's certified\nI listen to you and I talked to and hurt you talked about certified being important [noise] uh yeah they want to charge me like twenty twenty eight hundred dollars that it served a side um\nAnd that that's more than an extended morning would cost you\nSo I wouldn't do that um but\nHere's the only the only thing you said so far that concerned me is the value of the car\nYou likely to keep this thing a long time I'm sure\nThen if that's the case then I'd get to twenty Seventeen if it's if it's in good shape and equipped properly for you um you know it doesn't bother me so much that's been set in their ... but be sure and check your options list\nTypically if a if a vehicle has been sitting there that long we are talking about two years um then maybe it was miss ordered or it's missing something or there's typically a story especially with a popular vehicle ...\nSo you know make sure that everything's there that you want to be there if you're gonna keep it a long time ten years from now whether it's the twenty Seventeen tornado to join that they're all going to be worth about the same uh ten years from now if you were going to trade pretty quick\nI go I think it's twenty Eighteen with the rebates are even go to the twenty Nineteen but it's only Seventy works for you it's OK I'm just you know drive it takes a good long test drive my car sets that long\nUh it's it's it's typical of the tires to get flap spots in them and sometimes those go away and sometimes they don't so drive it and make sure\nWell that's good with twenty Seventeen heck you can't go wrong there I appreciate the call Jim in Cleveland we're

boy and they're carrying a lot of confidence in the moments that prune\nIncarnate word or you know when I played with didn't have the chance of playing them guys but uh you know seeing their program starting off in Reno in Congress that's really good or not but I think of the Mars up in the town you know we saw a two weeks ago and Nichols you know mark came out pretty hot land you know of a rite nationally ranked football team\nI think they they didn't play a whole game they didn't they didn't show up for the second half of one of them are has a good chance of beating these guys and I think it would be a good wins in his late afternoon\nBall game though you've done these uh would you call it a little more did you like the ... better than the game I I didn't like\nThe afternoon game or you know everything's kind of in a rush when you wake up you've got to get to the field out you know everything's a little earlier\nA little hotter and sometimes a little broader a\nYou know you like the cool afternoons and eat and then you know getting done after afternoon game is kinda weird because you have a full day when\nYou talk about an awful week it's been two weeks is the cardinals have played a lead the off we really help out though the hills above bruises and I liked the off weeks centered in the middle of the season like Mars is this year\nAnd excuse me again next year though I mean the ... a good time oh yeah ... you know anytime you can get 'em in the middle of the season is it they feel like a month you know they have all your mom's and bruises\nThat weekend that you have no game and it feels like five days off almost you know you're still practicing hard and you know staying healthy a coach can kind of sit and players out you know let him rest up and up\nAnd I buy weeks are really important especially you know getting a lot of key players back on the\nOther games around the conference already underway central Arkansas in America do just thinking on as the bay Nichols enabling Christian that game just now kicking off out it was just coming up at four o'clock this absolute Houston Baptist the southeast of Louisiana and at six o'clock tonight\nWe used to say that you know the northwestern states\nMcNeese leads the way at four no I have a game above a head\nOf incarnate word then you have one losses for Nichols sort of the largest on them and that's your upper half of the president you hear this all the time ... year coaches talked about it and it just goes with the outlay especially with the south fought with the four teams\nRight to the top twenty five in the country in the fall but this was a conference\nWhere on any given Saturday in team could lead any team\nYeah I don't know why is that confidence\nIs like that all these things are so closely matched and they run different and and I think the coaches are pretty good job of\nThe game planning and I think that's what we're seeing a lot of confidence in such a guessing ended coaches are really ... you're not sure who's gonna win every game [noise] um you know big schools\nLike saying he's dean and that may and those are really good schools and then you have another good school being added to the conference you doesn't but you know I don't think they'd get played the the upper tier schools I think he's going to make nice with them and you mentioned that after this afternoon here are the next four ballgames\n... at nickel on this than say I'm an absolute walk and phone and that's a that's a tough road as a tough road and then they got a unique about them then they wait three weeks\nAnd they'll play a non complex human Iowa State I'm not sure of the conference works but for some reason the heart of words really plain eight harbors games this year you were the rest of your plane nine [noise] and I was talking with um\nI'm not sure I was talking with earlier but I think every year and you're going to have one team in the conference get one last comment and I think that's just not the number of games works out and stuff like that and I guess this year though the\n... the new going on the road with the black you almost un W black helmets white Jersey Black sampling made the trip over the years to listen to San Antonio end up talking about you I W a little bit they they're under a new coach or the\nBoats are are for you I W is Eric Moore's yeah he has a good track record from the San Antonio I'm loving and we're a law is under lifting very Mike Leach\nWhere you have the air attack but he makes in the run because what are you talking about corn and word if they've got the er league is a leading Russia and was one that sticks and [noise]\nYeah I I'm really interested to see what kind of an office they run especially being you know coming from likely to Arab thing\nI'm I'm I'm curious to see it as they climb and list that he was known or even you know men being such a good Russian team I don't think we're going to be that time and they seem to have a good group of kids there than any time you start up a new program or you can go into a bigger\nConferences that can be a challenging situation for these coaches but they seem to be on the right track and hopefully the marketing you know we want to where we're happy that they're on the right track but we do on the heartbeat um today\nWe want to root for the right cardinals and and we would go to my ... year program here just\nA couple of minutes but uh [noise] I Know [noise] games are closer but you're still not winning and that's what the fans want you want to win money will fill the fans and the social lives right now you got to trust\nThe product and [noise] have you got to pick what you know and you know we're seeing the proof that what they're doing is working because they're improving each week they are just not quite in turn that corner as far as finishing a poor quarterly game you know we will see\nA great first half of the ... when they come out and that can happen is you know they're not they're not really job and like they were at the end of that first time I'm you know from the beginning of the season we\nSaw they didn't come out in the first time at all and then they kind of show up in the second half so you know that she said things are coming together and hopefully with this by we make them they were able to regroup and you get some of the key player in the back you know it's a hit ... great because it's kind of a recession\nYou know and it also and this was very unfortunate for the cardinals because you use your by weekly get healthy and unfortunately the cardinals lose already hiding in caves Robinson a with a broken and he's out at least two to three weeks\nHopefully you'll be back or late in the year by the time the guard with what you use the ... the day\nBut that's just such a fuss out anything to lose your tie it in and he's really more than a side in this kid came in here as a quarterback to lose a good apple yeah he's good he's a really good bloggers who I think that's one of the most\nUnderrated hang you think of them I'd in you know having their job is walking and are they do\nThe job that he does a really good job at it and then when you get into ball he's a he's a truck if they [noise]\nGet us all of our cardinals or the cardinals incarnate word a thrill five kick off here from ...\nYeah the Harley's are always enjoyed when I bought the Harley's down on a building you're on its way now and they're reading at the end and it's really loud and it's pretty cool that's a little different different perspective to the game and get your little popped up\nOn on the defensive side to guard was going to have to get after a freshman quarterback John Hope of the kids about six feet two hundred and ten pounds when you get bigger and better the years go by you not argue out\nYou have a nice touch a badge of honor year though and you know he's really good in the pocket so you got to put a lot of pressure on\nAnytime you've got a good pocket passer and if I Do not give him time to throw hill will he will find a check and every time you know you can't and the deep end you can't cover up for every route on the hill especially can't cover up the check now you\nKnow that's why those are there are about to the edge or turned out to the flat and make a quick you know two or three are again and cut you off but uh if ... you know I think if we found another situation where a marketing firm um our defenses hockey getting pressure on the quarterback advance for a long\nYou know in a ... a lay off ... leads us out my congressman rushing\nSix hundred and twenty nine yards or Russia um the Iraqis the yard [noise] you know Ninety yard run on here you've done in the end zone Hi uh this year so you know we're going to\nYeah he does he the experience running back how he finally name and and now it's like he has some pretty good break away and he has a Ninety aren't Ron [noise]\nSo uh you know that's going to be dangerous you know we've all of them are given a big place that's something that the deep and half the limit you know going in the big place that's what killed them a nickel they Seventy yard forty or thirty are first a hard when when you're given those up every job or every other job\nBut I'm I'm not too worried about the running back because Omar events of ... they're pretty dominant front in pretty good at hog enough to get you know they gave nipple a pretty good hard time and the first half of often around and I don't think incarnate word has played a\nA a I guess what'd you say an upper tier Rushdie fan ... the games up leading up to this or the softer than what a [noise] then what do you believe\nIn Rodney Randall the senior from Beaumont oh then I feel he's been banged up and the off we really of them you should be pretty good shape and it goes\nYeah Rodney Randall he him in a demand journey and you know the big key players behind you know I think they carry a lot of the\nAll the weight of the ... you know they I think they were heavily on and on my tight man coverage [noise] uh one thing that we talk and we've seen when Romney Rand all year they usually put him on the ... the veterans fever and Rodney Randall has to cover that guy all night\nBarely comes on the field [noise] I'm looking forward to it again I'm also looking for\nI you know I Want them on during the game

and\nGo to a very good we can and also at the right place at the right time that comes with preparation or the you know I met he knew he thought that might come in and the quarterback from them back and he knew that ball and going and he was able to make it quick and there's a very quick interception on it\nYou know and uh with uh the robbers and being out you know the young man bought more from Lumberton maintenance by two out of touch a reception at the nickel ... image on short for really gonna step it up\nYeah they'll have to step up anytime you have a big time starter go out of the rotation especially in the receiving corps the tide in you know you're you better hope your physical conditioning is on point because I hear about the gas [noise] that's also a big factor\nYou know when when injuries come into play you know you're having these guys in the game longer than what you if we would especially in France if it's out of the um [noise] um you know especially in a secondary ah once your second year it gets hard you know often that's where he ... he has he plays down buildings and stuff like that I Hope\nI'm opening up a Mars secondary you know they're able to
