{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "Than ever thought about that I was familiar with it a sprinkler systems you want to have those properly and straw with the uh back flow preventer but I I never thought about just in a justify it should really half one of the\nOh yes and a lot of people see them there and and they'll start Lincoln and they'll just take it off and throw it away and you know it's a five dollar part at home depot or or a Monday supplying a that little part Derek and really can really save somebody's life and they don't know a lot of people don't even realize what it is\nWell in in particular in the home if you have children small children elderly or immune compromised folks I mean any of us could be affected but certainly if you have some very susceptible folks ah it can be very serious consequences\nOh yes Oh yes and in some of these you know pesticides and stuff now days that are used they they can have some pretty harmful stuff to someone if they accidentally ingest it and and you know it's just a way to you know to to protect your home and keep it from you know from harming anybody there\nSo again don't ah go ahead and installed those things if you have one in his leaking don't just take it off and toss it away Oh absolutely get another one the other one is that something we haven't talked a lot about this but do it yourself items I was teasing in front of the show I every time I've tried to\nDo something in a in a a bathroom or whatever everything so corroded ended up calling a plumber feminine break something off the wall but\nThe truth is there are some things we can do ourselves things like a back flow ah prevent or is that some of the average homeowner can change up\nOh yes and and sometimes we do get calls you know from from the from the homeowner asking well I'm trying to do this and I just can't get it and you know and sometimes they're able to just walk them through and say this is really all you got to do and it's that simple you know because in some stuff done require service call you know they call will kind of walk them through and explain it to them and then if they still can't figure it out\nYou know and then we'll come you know come out and look at it that we can do with it but little stuff like that I agree you know and and and it's good for the homeowner to another taking her places that when he goes wrong it don't end up in the trash in and we see a lot of houses that don't have them and then it's become and to be\nA real big deal in the city of ... really having to start cracking down on those um if you get an inspection anything on your home they're requiring that thing to be installed\nAnd also we drive a ... a little earlier if I have you come out and stole ... a nice name brand Fawcett is it possible then that I can replace the cartridge or whatever myself later on when it needs replacing\nSome of the better brands yes um some of the false out there nowadays do require special tools and by the time you go purchase all them tools you could easily just hire somebody hired\nSomebody to come to write off I'm interested in that and intend to stay in that home for a while again need to talk to my plumber about this I'm not interested in something I could easily replaced you and you tell me what that's going to be so uh yeah I Need to talk to you about that and I absolutely\nI'm also a torch big maintenance item there oh yeah always seems to be a maintenance item\nThere and there's so many different makes them models nowadays and the the the flush capacity has gotten so low on them everybody's got the new idea to make it flushed better and so they've come up with some some pretty crazy ideas inside that tank to make it some flush better than others um\nAnd the toilets at Lincoln toll it let's just deadly running is actually the biggest water waste in the nation and I don't know that I get a call on a regular basis somebody with a three or four hundred dollar water bill\nMy and we go out there and it's simple as the flapper is leak and it's got a slight work to it and it just runs and they didn't know it they had no idea wow and and it can run it up there and you use the water you know the water Venus you just never realized that\nAnd usually for most folks replacing flap or something like that again that can be a do it yourself oh some of them yes and like if some of these ... you you take the top often you don't recognize anything there\nAnd it's sometimes if you're not sure on those it's best to leave him alone some of those parts in these newer tank you can get really expensive really quick really actually you're getting into all your electric flushed now the ones that automatically flushed themselves starting to be the big thing and some of that stuff in that tank is pretty pricey\nSo and it's all plastic of course everyone these plastic now um so\nYou know been and it just the wrong way is your bro you're buying another part but we definitely on Eleanor ones most of them have a phone number ... ... if you have any questions you can also called manufacture and a lot of times they can walk you through what your problem will be\nFetch amazing how we've taken something a book which seemed to be so simple and I guess that is for the water conservation we've taken something seem to be so simple and we've made it so complex oh it's very they've gotten very complex well whether it's like a water heaters we were talking about earlier\nAnd a lot of that I guess was for safety sake but we've taken what seemed to be a simple heater that had served us well for idols fifty years Seventy five years and we have\nSo we designed it that sometimes your difficulty even keep ...\nOh yeah well and and nowadays kids efficiency no that's what they're after is the most efficient and course them more efficient you get the more complicated you get naturally um and then when you get into you know these things have so many moving parts maintenance and cleaning is a huge huge step to keep on running properly\nWhat'd you in the old days you had a pilot light right was it that was our first move I guess as we moved away from that\nWell your standard hater still have a power line Jews and they still have a standard standard gas water heater still has a pow like now they're built a lot safer now they have a silly around the world about either closed so you know the odor water heaters had an open burner so if you did spill gas\nNine times out of ten it was just going to blow up front right from the new ones are designed better where it can still happen\nYou know gas on they can still do it but in less likely\nAnd the coach still there where you have to put it up off the floor in the garage and ... which is understandable but the pow I'd still there it's always still on on the standard water heater\nAnd it's I did not realize that so we do have electronic ignition when it comes to the gas ranges and that sort of thing they moved away from the island lights\nBut still on the water and what about furnaces in such a the addict those and moved away from most of them have went over to electronic Clinton now which also brings up that other point that a lot of people don't realize or other than because really you think about the water heater sometimes you're thinking about you are doing the\nThe water plumbing but obviously plumbers to gas plumbing and you're going to have\nTo be a cold and for things like I I Want a gas furnace uh there's going to have to be a plumber to come in to make sure make that final connection I assume oh you run pipe exact same thing with the gas water heater on average going to have to be a plumber that comes in and make those connections\nYes and in nowadays the way the code is move so much and we've learned over the years the different do's and don'ts witness with the gas system I'm with a lot of people don't realize that has become an issue over the past four or five years is lightning with gas lines ... so now now you have to properly ground your gas system\nThe way of lightening does some way accidentally hit your gas meter\nYou know it it's grounded so the house you is is it could still have problems after his lightning but it is to protect the house from you know virtually catching on fire from a lightning strike I would've never thought of that yes you do so in that actual current code now anytime we mess with the gas we have to be sure the gas lines are bonded by lost an electrician\nI did not do that so by by an electrician to August so we're sort of involving more and more folks and\nAt least disciplines but at the end result is we're supposed to be safe right safety\nSafety safety is the is the key so when we're building a new home and you mentioned you all do new construction before if I go and look at that and I started looking around at some of the plumbing or the gas or whatever it's going to look different oh after you get a little different from what I may see in a home that was built Twenty years ago Thirty years ago\nAnd there's lots of new products now especially when you get into the gas out of things you know the standard before was black aren't pipe and go asked by how much let us read it on the job but nowadays they have a corrugated stainless steel tubing that is it's a very good product at virtually last forever\nUm the new products you actually have lightning protection built into the product so where if it if it lightning kitchen it helps absorbent and disperse it out versus just blowing up a [laughter] so that you know it it's when a long ways in the past probably ten years when it comes to gas lines\nThat is amazing and we don't have time to talk about some of the flexible water lines the packs but that also has changed a plumbing a great deal just a lot of advances another reason to make sure you're using a license bonded\nProfessional plumber own list because these products role so do you write a jail you're just not going to be familiar with a thank you for coming in today now once again how do people get in touch with you\nThe best way to ... is our phone number four o nine

written answers\nTo those questions it just might solve your problem for you Dave in Houston hello\nJerry thanks for taking my call sure working at it for you\nI Want to get your recommendation on a truck is a daily driver I put on about twenty five to thirty thousand miles a year\nI'm looking to keep the truck so maybe you know two hundred thousand miles but not really interested you know not meeting for telling or anything like that just a a daily driver occasional runs to the Home Depot picking up things that sort of thing\nAre you thinking full size truck halftime\nI haven't decided yet I'm Down to some of the the smaller Chuck state they seem a little too small so I'm Still trying to figure out what would be the best um best choice\nWell I tell you the Colorado and the Kenyan from GMC\nUm are both good size trucks I mean there there are smaller than the Hamptons but the Hamptons keep getting bigger so these trucks are about the size of trucks ten years ago before they started really getting large uh the ride good they drop good are easier to park\nAnd make you turned singing backup and that sort of thing and a half time so I Would definitely consider that a Toyota Tacoma same scenario bigger than you think probably a very good truck he's any of those will make the two hundred thousand mile mark without any issues at all\nIf you decide to go half ton\nGosh it's always a tough call for just got some amazing incentives this month on the twenty eight teams so if you could go with an F. one fifty\nReally liked Silverado it's good truck fell in love\nWith the twenty Nineteen ram a ... it's it's an amazing truck\nI'm ... and there are some rebates on the twenty not doing ramps not as much as the turning Eighteen to buy far but still an struck in any those would make you a great daily driver that if you just gonna if you're looking for an enjoyable ride and Dr not don't care about\nTelling her hauling or anything heavy then I think you need those would would be fine I think you're going to have to get out and do some driving Dave\n... yeah the engine recommendation if you get it up\nYou know if you go with the Hamptons I liked the Ford or with a three point five equal boost it's been a great engine distribute five point three has been a proven engine for many many years\nUh in the Colorado I'd go with the six cylinder otherwise it's going to be a little bit under powered if you go with the Tacoma the force owner in it is great\nYou will have an absolute you these got plenty of power and gets pretty good gas mileage as well and the reason I say yeah I think you need to get out and do some driving is because these trucks all ride and Dr different the coma\nAs good a truck is it is it's kind of farm run drive you're going to feel more bumps in the road than you are with the Colorado where the Kenyan you won't feel any of them with the half ton trucks\nSo I think you've got to get out and take some good test drives and see what you like because there's not a bad truck in the group that I just named off\nI appreciate your thoughts\nNot a problem circuit good deals for all those Tom ball for classic she'll be sugar land\nA big way

of fact\nAh it it's a little too early to be able to say oh I think it's you know great vehicle for you know a hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand miles but if you're going to lease again you can't get hurt too bad even if she doesn't like it the only thing I Would question is the level of luxury versus what she's used to\nAnd and I got to say there's a that was as nice as it is I I I don't think it compares interior wise luxury wise to what she's got right now\nSo I Would I Would at least look at it you might given where you are located you might go somewhere closer and just let her drive one and then she loves it then we'll get to set up with the Audubon but if not then I'd probably go back with another infinity looked at my effect you least section\nBut really ... they're
