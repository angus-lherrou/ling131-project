we've been up your wife\nBecause of the rotation and the thing goes out for three years or back in our ... year swinging but ah\nThe cardinals come in here right and a lot of momentum yeah big game last week again than is called the ... really come alive I'm running the ball\nA head over four hundred and thirty five yards rushing an off and then event you know we felt good third now I'm no good third down effort by them you know shutting down on those learning on that you know we've been talking about all these and like uh hopefully they can carry that momentum into this week you know it's always really hard under a big win\nReplicated that you know if they can show signs of the themes muttering really coming together and\nLooking down on the field we do the neural covert junior in uniform ease warming up throwing the ball looked like he's in pretty good shape as we'll hear from a ... just a few minutes we'll hear that the\nThat the covert neural is a game time decision but the if he can't go there's a lot of confidence\nIn Jordan avoid the backup at George ... he did a really good job last week a stepping up and filling in for over a you know I really like how I play the moves really well he's not quite is doesn't run the ball as well as with over does but\nYou know that might be that might come in time he he's got the ability to do so but I think this covert such a natural runner and when he runs Giovanni such a heavy heavy runner to\nBegin a natural run or you know a day walk has done a very good job or Lamar and um but uh he is a been a company to buy mild ones out who's returned to the line up and that is a very good one to one\nOne of the more the type of the runner that will run more young and try to you guys live and go round you walk or the more of the time that he will run you over yeah\nThe downhill time runner in a very good combination you know I don't think the intention was going into the season of rotating 'em like they are now but\nWe're just seeing you know absolute dominance by those two running backs and they're really run the ball all good false security\nOr make a good decision they're not getting a lot of negative yards either when they touched off\nAn awful lot of ... ball games will return on deeper the deed regarding her that's been a big big boost for that the defense of\nEleven yeah that's a you know our defenses or

ranked right or the other kids you know there's a little more nerves now you're opposed last week there now you know fighting with the when nothing to lose you know and I had a little chip on their shoulder for you know such close games but now you know they've seen some of the conference shakeup and all that and I like\nHey we can be can finish I'm pretty ... pretty high in this conference I mean we we started went out and it's something that's very possible now you know and ... was that this the last week\nAfter the ball game and a coastal brought it up there on a Monday afternoon weekly a press conference he was that it was last week a program changing when and I agree with that answer\nOne when is not a program she and when yeah hey you could win on that one game and then go out and lose the rest of 'em and then we could win or lose the next ... and I agree with that ... percent you know that's a really good statement a really good answer\nTo that question than you know these these guys and they've been working hard and they've been doing the right thing and I think they're finally turning a corner on what they meant doing you know they're starting to run the system effectively I think on the off and on the ball they're really starting to click in jail and you hear that word a lot and um when\nWhen you have a bunch of new players you know that are in town a maturing they're starting to click and jail just imagine the next year you know how how well that is going to be over with it's really important for you know the rest of the ... next year for them to finish out strong [noise]\nWhat do you talk about the margin I mean you're\nBasically like a year in this particular offered this set up like a year program for go my skull rework the profit yeah trust of the process\nThan I think uh that's what we're seeing in God's are starting to really fine and that's why they're kind of turn on the corner and we saw on the off at the start of the ball man we just saw an\nExplosive running game and pretty penalty free or you know on the with the big guys up front you know we didn't see too many holding calls other than those Holden calls amazing socks on the edge but you know those are going to happen when you're running on the edge [noise] ah they are hoping\nHe continued to see that you know we might be we might get into the uh little Jordan or we play the legs and um you know and into their uncovered and the feeling a hundred percent\nI think more and more than a capable in that gap you're a fate that covert last last week you know and you talked about the run and gave that brings up a really good point what do you want to much mowing lawns\nAnd they did a Walker yeah if you're a defensive coordinator you look into the hey these guys is Roger or over four hundred yards rushing against Sam Houston in state okay you're focused on the run you open up the path you know it really helped Moammar out together\nOn a on the defensive assignments you've gotta wonder okay little play action here they're you know you you really can't squeezed a lot of great but you can't bring the live\nActors up you can't bring the defensive backs up yeah so and you know if I was as I say the defensive coordinator today I Would say okay we're going to put five guys down a line of scrimmage we're going round Baird evening and we're going to make 'em or throw the ball and let's see how they can throw the ball\nOr you know and if they don't want to go back to the wrong wrong and bread and the job market not passing\nThem all well and then we will have the time you spend on their clothes because they know that they can run the ball and pass the ball well I was in the it'll be interesting how at the start of the game\nIn the cardinals are going to be a couple of weeks before we returned home next week we make the big trip to Conway again little Arkansas and then two weeks into the final game of the year and we always reach us you know with the kids and killed his dad was there to the community come on out in two weeks will return home it gives you some Baptists\nAnd its senior or they get into this program for war and some of them

what do you remember about the media to family and the\nOut there so yeah matter now your wife and my family out there and my wife and I remember it was freezing cold [laughter] but uh you know is a bittersweet to a good football career I I think are claiming nice\nYeah we we lost but still a good game nonetheless I've got to you know hug some\nGood friends for the last nominally a nuclear arm member going in the locker room and an economic had and how are they going to mom and everybody remembers ... and you realize that hey that's it and ... what do you do with the big picture window and
