drive by stink Obama respect you know a lot of dumb but he didn't\nSo you didn't give them the time of day and when he did it was looking down his nose but they didn't care because Obama was hip he didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one since\nObama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what your job or do you watch story I said you mean about the show ... he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central ... at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I had to pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point\nBut it was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's impossible there is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold and operated in Turkey so on the last ... had entered the password for the consulate why why network on his watch\nWhich I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why five most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife I network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together\nBut only if you have answered that why fi networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that\nI myself didn't learn you had to do this until a couple of years\nAfter I got my first one I mean that's how old's your a setting that it is anyway certainly says you just blew\nUp you blew up\nThe reason all these

mad after [noise]\nNobody's most of the day they say the show was recorded the events of have to record on watching that race will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] another headline you probably have seen this shit and pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house the\nTruth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating\nBlue wave including none other than the door yeah I'm a Democrat National Committee cheating and election rigging down to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise]\nThat's right so see and I got rid of Fox willingly open our mid to late ... had done in Brazil on an hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in politics bill\nAnd I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather I don't scramble my eggs until my chicken hatch\nShe said naming there's so much she left it couldn't happen we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point\nThe impact of the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although\nThere is even more survey data now that the Kavanaugh story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focused on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned and shocked where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what but rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nYou think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here started campaigning as if this blue wave weren't a deadlock\nIf the blue wave or why are you still hear me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a couple a couple of stories Democrats that's not the worst\nEventually you are misquoted Donald Trump does not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing the need for excuses a pay\nHe thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory but it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and somebody's gonna blame him\nThis is why Trump never\nMisses an opportunity to talk to the media it's why he tweets over and over and over again so now we got a little Bryan's daughter at CNN soundbite number one this was

Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces in in the fire and pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents everything has\nBlown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on them Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blew up on them every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now\nYou know they've thought all along the mother is going to get the good on how Trump's\nFoley election by shooting in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Mahler is not going to deliver your key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with all the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but they're they're looking to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up base\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ball game for this is what they have been counting on they have been they've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump jaded with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\n\nThat air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural India is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived I Would not have been some\nSurprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies and the drive by media\nRather than break the rules and release the report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his\nTrump probe sources say so each day we're going to get\nReferences to the fact that ... Don Mueller's wrapped up his mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's though the election is imminent that\nIs what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion\nCloud of\nDanger that port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms wouldn't\nBlow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of\nThis is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goal is to Rosenstein who is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and they're in his decided whether or not that it has made public\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nA during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against\nA seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and yes and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair\nAnd my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans but in a way\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high right now for not only myself if you put in a neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the press conference they ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation any should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well in that shocks you write\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but\nI'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national impressed and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or audio ... that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed at frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and that you know like a newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up or might\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it than you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if your fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not cherry Tobar surprised they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus that used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nTo take a break but I have so much to say\nRussia's probably

I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it went with it\n\nIn the primary I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\n\nHe doesn't [noise] it's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter]\nIt's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor now I imagine the\nReal journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\n\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the pizza file story while the other paper puts it on the cover haven't confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got as a beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the news ... whereas the female editor didn't have the guts to run it and so the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they\nObviously you're not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of this press\nI have no idea it's it's I think it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's runs cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things\nIt's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's it's bad hit\nEverybody everybody as a rubber made including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's ...

could happen\nSince they've decided to leave that in baller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this is going to drive the left literally batty\nThat it ... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves how long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is\nHow long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian ...\nJake Tapper any reason to start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we not insured affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not well let's play the game let's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up to the mall or it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if there is a lot of pressure brought to bear on Mahler to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever and somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see him and they release it\nAnd there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the

about this the idea that they are cleaning shores but wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply to look after the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis through your this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people\nI mean they're they're

four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said to the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump did was remind everybody of this or

helpful to their ... their cars which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence\nPlaces people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her\nMocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply reminded everybody in real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point\nIn the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump did\nThat and cause the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThen\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford vanished you have no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well it does happen but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said there were there to say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support

judge\nIn Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to a news story but at the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drawn Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the ... the

you think he's selling out but he gets that first take\nOn the record media says well it was very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible very compelling shantytowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you have no evidence and here's the evidence that she doesn't know out of his blah blah blah and\nTrump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit a bit from the media was not reporting and she had to pay his legal fees the media was not reporting of been Trump win\nAnd remember what was
