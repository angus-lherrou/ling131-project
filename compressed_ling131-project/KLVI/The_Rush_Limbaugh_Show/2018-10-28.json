Fox News the homeland security secretary speaking out\nThe death in the synagogue shooting coming on the heels a mail bomb investigation is something secretary accused Nielsen says cannot stand in this country she says people using free speech is a shield to hurt people is not America\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending\nAlmost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America\nTo and that may yet happened down the road that CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let and it's the wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid germs at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen\nHip hit it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media\nNarrative it was a meeting that was\nNot born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an apple yet everybody\nTo rely on polling data to suggest that it's ...\nAnd I happened to the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huffing puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about sending a National Guard there but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies the border and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want it but last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs like the ... they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do with anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters begin to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be mightily disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance in Arizona is around two thousand miles\n\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role\nIn transportation but there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people to sign to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think money we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams of what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human PC [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing again I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid\nTerm election day so I don't walk enough to know how many miles a day\nYou could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest\nFor the next day that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those every unreal Lyndon that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand\nAnd then of course a ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News ... ... S P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\n\nHoping to catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing\nTo join the main group which reportedly and swelled the ranks with several people who've already been born in the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the more again Monday morning departing southern may cause city up tapping Chula the smaller group trailing entered wipe them out on from Honduras late Sunday according to the a P\nSome in the second the caravan are said to have experience in getting across the border it includes a number of deportations have some of whom have been sent home multiple times\nEight twenty nine year old the editor Anthony ... is reportedly was deported for the six time from the U.S five months ago said they catch you and you're trying to get back he has a son and a U.S citizen girlfriend living in Birmingham, Alabama according to the Washington Post\n[noise] so uh\nAll great points they already qualified\nFor asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises it's adventure waiting but I think this is the left\nBehind it for a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\nFive\nSixty ... here's your chance of rain in your hand every weekday listen detection in one one thousand dollars to sixteen times a day five of them to ... pm get a grand in your hand forego McGill we add on top of the morning to\nSee the Toyota and orange here in the market for new to it or any real vehicle not shopping with is cautious houses are built to save every buyers thousand dollar code orange drive a little they have a lot of people say makes a difference [noise] [noise]\nFox News on that he had like Pennsylvania officials held a news conference this morning to address the shooting at a Pittsburgh city God not left loving people dead\nWe will be here to help you through this horrific episode will get through this dark as day of Pittsburgh history by working together\nPittsburgh Mayor Bill produced up the victims range in age from fifty four to Ninety seven and included a married couple FBI special agent Robert Jones that authorities are still searching for information regarding the suspect Robert powers\nWe continue to conduct interviews scribes social media review possible surveillance camera video and exploit digital media to determine how and why powers committed this terrible act I ask again that if you have information that may help these costs that's\nThis is Fox News [noise]\n[noise] three\nYears ago making a murderer became less a TV show than a force\nOf nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice and it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan death the trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part to overeat budding emerge\nMounting a murderer is now on the ... I heard radiolab just open the athletes have thought that\nWe are there's a real blow everywhere you want to listen on our free I hard radiolab downloaded now I've been\nThousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why it makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic\nIllustration of how soft this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough\nTo know what's best for being driven solely by a motion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because there's some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing may as well just a race the border and saint of the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get into the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\n\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because of the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost\nAs an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this and frankly I don't\nThink they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't for somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\n\nI'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial sound bite me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people\nWorked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification\nAnd I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer out we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAh there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor can call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can't use the military because a positive comments ...\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what Woodrow Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way no\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou know you you you he may not send the military they may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside life to seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized border if they bomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bringing back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can't try to deal with this on his own he leads to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get away with it off\nTo

until we get our power back\n\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way\nRepublicans in the past them kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise to do this that and the other they get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media they've had Republicans who are elected properly in Tampa David\nThey've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to their Jim Acosta\nIn Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside and just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a week or longer and he can't stand it\nAfter all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you keep falling for the life and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to any more [noise]\nBut what is troubling as to look behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes [noise] and he does it I think because it's still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling\nTo me now who believes is he does it I think\nBecause it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spent and got like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers hey resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to want peace that I had ready to go

biased\nPrint says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any honest leftist for future generations\nThe cabinet fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persisted with it\nEven to the point of tearing not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left\nAs this or go larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfits and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate\nTrump this is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're\nPainful this is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely\nAnd what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftists either no rights alerting her at ... they do have Trump\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectual\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable\nAnd worst of all he doesn't have any ... except getting the job done\nHis goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life and short Donald Trump is a typical American accept exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself\nIn vents and uses I'll tell you folks and this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity they but they sit there and hypocritical he claimed\nTo despise Trump's they hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he is certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what\nI have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so certain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people are just

people you want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for him he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then they're decent people and all they want\nLife and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in the all they want is what we want we all have\nThese various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye of the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats booked asked if the timing worry them a

few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump enlisted explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he may deploy the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in groups to her five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense of ... because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put\nIn their shoes every day they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times I'll Trump is

they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital of the thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as a reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd they're perplexed because none of what they have done his work in a white has worked ... it's it it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald
