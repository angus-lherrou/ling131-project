becoming what in form\n... and a educated suspicion about this wouldn't tell you that it is a will say well let time on\nThe phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia or if there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very much\nRussia you know it's a you talked about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh\nWe have a dangerous dreams right we are out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh yeah that that information it's just not out there for the masses to obtain you know\nQuite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right or a to point fingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no loans that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for\nA Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that flip that around\nWhat does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way they thought\nDo not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not\nGoing the way they have a short us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls or tell them is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this\nThis mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then ...\nArms are going to Hillary and and you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the salt deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible\nFor that because of a joke I used to ...\nYeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the health of east\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because if you can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kinda thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already planning to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing\nThat right correct that's another time Tony I gave my idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush it taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no\nAh are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami for someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody was open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them ... say this was a philosophy that I have a stalled for four years on this program asking people to never forget there\nAre no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need\nTo be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirt\nUsed to the rush to excellent store\nOpen up some funny jokes line stories and so forth from I Would tell people
