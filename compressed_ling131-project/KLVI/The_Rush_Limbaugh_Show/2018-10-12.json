you later [noise] flooding\nTo the program glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off\nThe air is fascinating is they're really really really a fascinating is one of those guys too is you know really walk through the fire for his principles um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump sounds from South problem\nIs he's a reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a the ... will\nIt really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I much I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but then there's a certain the New York times today this is the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure\nAnd it goes through the Eric Holder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\n'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another ... a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take 'em behind the gym and beat the hell out of him I mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic\n... what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard well I mean I I you know that's\nThe ... this what they're saying they are trying to pose as Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're certainly not filling themselves at the new Donald Trump's ... they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all the Democrats who came out and said holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized rain but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to ...\nWhat made them almost unbeatable was for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least tried\nTo hide it\nThis switch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said there's no it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part\nAnd it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders because they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not emulating Martin Luther king\nYeah that was really the the the that was his deal mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd that ... that they would have followed Malcolm X things might have been worse for ... for ah for blacks for a while\nYou're back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no 'cause you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to give you an associate yourself with those people ... right and you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who\nWho go down these roads ... you know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people were like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but the Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal\nHuman instinct and that's not even Nazis that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I mean there was an actual death in Charlottesville right ... and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was all over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even

that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling

polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning or the ... in the Senate that would require due to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every\nOther seats if they have\nThey held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their

rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this was a\nTraditional year party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all running in certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... an abortion is is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands nobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at like ed ... hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they wrote over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this\nHow do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made then how do you get a distributed it how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of karma guys now it's it's it's a it's\nA procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating a PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder\nThere is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent\nGore and violence in the movie at its depicted in in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer he was a mass murderer of\nPeople in the room that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did permit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even\nAnd his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your moving target but you want to be truthful about it and you want the message\nTo be delivered but you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so when I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left abortion\nIs not even human and some Bible tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people who put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is deemed came as one\nOf the uh the actor who plays a guy's now himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGoing to be immersed in a bunch of repulsive\nGore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story about the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have put everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people who put their careers and the line agreeing to appear and star even Searcy\nOr directing the film [noise] uh [noise] [noise]\nOh ...
