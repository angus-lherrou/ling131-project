the longer we said constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with the leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws\nIn America they have to rely on an activist judges to do it now you\nMight miss it was Russia mergers before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important

decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this

they want to be forced on every ... this is the\nPoint what they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nThe same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth\nThere were in town that they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free

it's in our show our cars but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but\nThis is an appearance about a book that she has written called good and bad the revolutionary power

have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products no power can be useful in ruins nailing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nAnd then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported cabin on and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst\nMen\nThey have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last three weeks would have to have been blind just see the Democratic party had a line itself in such a way\nThat men work or do not typically guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable in fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe both the Ford that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened because that's what men do\nThey just change tactics and the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate our youth\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and ah thankfully we have Trump cannot has put some ... on the final Republican\nUh ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly\nAnd it forces issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get on the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity that never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these types of issues but I think largely the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to who who was able to get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point like twenty twenty let me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn mind staying in just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things out of bed automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this month just common for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans aren't not have to spend that time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case for\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election that Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\n\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people are gonna be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the that hadn't happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah I went on when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this is going to be so old by then actually hurt a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet [laughter] I just have to chuckle\nUm\nThat I can I
