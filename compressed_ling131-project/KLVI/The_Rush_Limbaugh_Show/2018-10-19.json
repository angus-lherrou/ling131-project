tried everything they can to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has thrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with failure\nThey have failed in every ah tempt every effort to\nGet Donald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and the twenties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty four\nSeven and the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about a simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for be moved from office since the day after the election I guess what mothers about that is what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been\nMobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they wanna destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush same pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not fifth they they want him out of office every day now the failure compounds the rage look at just some\nOf the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks and then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Kristin balls e\nForward that was a two for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem that's what they were trying to do\nChristine balls the four Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then Townsend as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue that\nWas after investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead\nHow about the shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and\nWhere is he now and where is the issue of gun control where is this story that young people\nHigh school and college students had had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the in Iraq where\nIs that today what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based\nOn a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real what do you mean Russia's Syrian during the war on these totally real but he's a media creation\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David hog did not literally create a bond neither does okay seal protest these people do not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump paths are like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike August gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hawk we may want to see it nobody saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is not on this is real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton has affected link killed that by saying my husband\nYou can't say that he did anything wrong with Monica Lewinsky she was an adult she was a consenting adults jihad Myra ...\nShe was a consenting adults I knew what Bill was\nIt not abuse because Bill Clinton knew that she was an adult\nOr by by me too movement\nI mean if the ... that ran the bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women claiming her husband abused them comes up not to defend her\nGuy what good as the me to move\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without\nAnyway okay I Walk I promise I promised soundbites on your phone calls are coming up after this break I\nI'm trying to encounter ... for ... hands are always found it on my ...

me run through that I see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me this is totally abs and I'm In a in a what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers\nAre based on data that as a result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome out of their work and\nWe know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty eight I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\n\nAnd there was one maybe two polls showed that he was really in it and couldn't win it Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions is reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election as your thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so\nMaybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\n[noise] but then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen houses gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up work up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates him\n[noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop\nRejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that many people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage an anger there promoting insanity\nAnd lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to\nBe what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the\nJustice associated with the Democrats are doing is landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country and they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went on for like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandon that\nAn outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey haven't dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that\nDiscriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just\nSo where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats has reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a
