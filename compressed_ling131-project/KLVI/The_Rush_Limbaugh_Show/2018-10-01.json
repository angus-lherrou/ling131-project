made aware of this it had to kill the Washington Post or write about this headline Canada agrees to join trade accord with us in may call sending new NAFTA deal to Congress\nSo we're renegotiating NAFTA Canada Canada which then they want to know part of it they ask in the last moment hey don't forget us can we be why did this to grow up said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just me and the terrorists\nTrump said hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap\nTariffs

finance ministry yesterday\nThe track I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partner such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri\nOrdinary American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do and it's not done here is the president\nToday at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made since NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our auto jobs even more than the throughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know and extended the statement\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something to live a long advocated he wasn't just announcing the deal\nGot done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism or think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason that we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs in their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking about I got scared to death\nAt lesson has been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us this kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... in the\nRespect of others it's up to us just show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world

they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party\nWhich uh\nWe do it all the time here but uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct about me as he has just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal\nDianne Feinstein or what do you live with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came somebody raised the question of how won the world did Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it was we're made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington Post she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a visit you most a note ringer it's fair it starts button light\nAnd it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff the other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers\nFor Christine Blasey Ford who was seen the letter and so some\nSenators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually ask her point of order\nThe chairman Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrage just allegations that I or my staff at least\nThis letter\nOr just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff if any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't hear what she says it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them did anybody here in a leak it she turns or did you look at the ... she turns back to the camera we need to make it Mr German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say oh is this how we're going to determine who leak something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and that's it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your leaked this letter and like\nOh no no no most of those ones all does she turns back around so we we didn't do it unless you German as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it\nIt was strategic just like what happened on friday was to teach it strategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that have occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't reproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally habit\nBut I've got it I'm not

afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she's last\nShe's not the least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is\nAutomatically said to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so still shaken by what happened all\nThose years ago you could see yeah because she really knew how to make it look\nLike that I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\n\nAmericans believe her and most believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of a thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters\nSixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent Republicans\nWho are the smart ones\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both verbally bubble if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\n\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent St rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent or fifty seven percent in favor of confirmation meaning meaning the people\nIn this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there and when the pollsters told them\nThat in fact\nThe numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture\nNow we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a jet Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nSaying no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association [laughter]\nYeah I was thinking on that uh there's no better way to um motivate group by attacking them in by attacking Kevin either basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm\nPart of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're going to have to show up in midterms are going to\nGoing to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I I'm a ... Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen\nBut again for Trump and twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on this case in thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend on Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody\nAbout all this\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats own rabbit you've been really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized they\nCould get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nOff from my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up that the plural evangelical base and that you know the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so what I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow you can't blame David Brody for being fifty percent informed because\nI I pulled back\nThat original production after it had gone viral all over the\nDrive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me\nPredicting Republican doom they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to lose the house of capital not confirmed that production was based\nAt a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird\nOut I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that predicts shouldn't set it could end up being the opposite here but uh\nThat prediction didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew Edgar about me\nThere been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half a mile from for him to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not Kavanaugh gets through I think the whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production\nWas everywhere I literally all over the world it was on Saudi TV was on the BBC\nIt was on Russian television I think even the north Korea is the little pot belly dictator mentioned it in his Saturday Night message to the people it was everywhere with Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to take it in a short everybody in the media covers it\n[noise] and I again I made that production at a at a

that's been at least another week long handled this\n\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI's go because you see there are thanks to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\n\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK\nThank you Mr ... needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question ...\nThis is what what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\n\nThat one of the Republicans do with that that they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on\nWill just tell you if this ends tomorrow offices all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more\nTime to fix the fact that it was rigged they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found

the only the headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to your White House expands FBI problem is that what the hell is that so I clicked on a lake Eyre is what it is [noise]\nRight here at my formerly Nick at the same fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview anyone necessary for Kevin inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys got to admit that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigation central I'm not that's fake news so then they've got a record Trump not limiting and best which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere
