weeks and it is Trump's spreads lives and stokes fears ahead of election I thought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic Cairo's graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but\nEvery time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner it didn't\nMatter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I check the New York times and there it is spreading fear\nTelling lies a hand of election\nThis caravan thing you know I [noise] I continue to study this and try to pick it apart to analyze it in and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find\nAnywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't\nFind anybody concerned or weren't or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it\nIn fact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately poor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland and that's not at all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about is it is an organized mob and like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it's\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic and he's all\nStructured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for it it's all focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective\n\nAnd the the obvious there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is you don't want to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years\nWe now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with\nSeven thousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by his claim they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles into wakes up and walking it physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven but it is all\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen it doesn't happen somebody is making this happened somebody set this up\n\nIt obviously is a bunch of left is just that this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is and it's not a caravan it's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way to win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists\nIn either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in our own individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump feared Trump hatred promoting the exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of stories today on the polling leading up to the midterms because it is all over the place

chance of winning control of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a four team and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical\nTo five thirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand sixty in where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent or Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump pan what twelve percent to ... percent\nChance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day through out the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times

that if they like their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out course we know from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those wise again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's status takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if\nYou control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you\nControl them you can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line that the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single

months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of caused the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along and it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest\nHimself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousands hadn't been germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody well\nWhere did you think about it ... you remember who started or remember\nWho was and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God that like you got to look up

tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meeting I'd have to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an auditor disaster that the American people quickly realize as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president then the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to

ever seen as a journalist this is it the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where people up into a frenzy can attack the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witness as a journalist man\nOh man where has this guy been to the Trump\nWhipping people up at a rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a\nGym you can get but you've got all kinds of ... you could go be a waiter you obviously listen well Mr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in\nAnd do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised courage and Ford say for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters and the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slammed moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting a good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm going to cut your throat and you know just ... I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that's the Trump effect on America\nWhat are you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia or maybe you can find Hillary's emails and media is looking for um nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand a Muslim the media they love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the\nEmails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nI think the Trump is recommending and praising ... girl violence Bobby ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up\nTo this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you do it I really didn't want to see what you're ... you know I'm just wondering what the dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with\nYou so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you let somebody throw it back on them and it said guy give a disgrace that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump
