U.S Mexico border President Trump resumed tweeting about the migrant caravan asserting that criminals an unknown middle Easterners or amid the crowd for which he offered no evidence he also said Democrats are to blame for not working with his administration on immigration reform\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay thing even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America does and that may yet happen down the road that CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show gave and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so

after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hip hip and it never was going to happen I don't I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen or the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan trucking north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm of\nWhat's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one

a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind wouldn't want this\nWho in

happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what takes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intended across the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world it's so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nAnd one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived\nEnough to know what's best are being driven soulmate by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened in our sociology\nAdults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having I may I ask a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing may as well just to raise the border and said to the world\nCome on in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but\nThe Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with\nThe people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they tried to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this and frankly\nI don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\n... or ... or like just pretty much he

these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nOr is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion\nAnd I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and I know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nYou he may not send the military they may call as a as a Congress and the government says there but there is no law says he can't\nThis incident ... what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the EU okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized as the border that if they bomb rushed the border like it down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring them back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly and so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else's but on the line get 'em on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good

hundred thousand people to want to get and that is not the kind of thing that happens with in a political party that is losing\nLosing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies\nYou know I had a post this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in the in the Phoenix area\nAnd that the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going into it\nUntil they got there and found out how impossible it would be they sent me a video that they took what their iPhone tennis max driving along the entire line in order to make the video fit\nTo be in a size they can email it to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis is that this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in and how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know\nNational media CNN MSNBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democrats' side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these

and so forth and this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in a decent seat which is what we're up against the on the Democrats' side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\n... the contrast here is striking and that's why you\nDo not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\nThat is the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures in the media is happy to show you those pictures the\nMedia can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can\nThat's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium it's Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play\nPut a hundred thousand people in there\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people marched jumped through Mexico\nMad walk out ... they are those people were really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside the lining up\nTwenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\nHow many of you by the way how many of you wouldn't joined a crowd of of of of Seventy five thousand people at a Seventeen or Eighteen thousand seat venue and yet they do I wouldn't I wouldn't if I drove by and saw the crowd that been from the get go home watching on TV [noise] try\nOkay back to the phones we go to a certain Wilton\nAnd Macon Georgia great to have you with us on ER network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well it's great to have you here\nIt's like the reason why I called I spend a lot of years military are retired from the interest although we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I'm I'm One hundred percent for putting the military or the board but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell\nWhen when you say the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this this is not a military invasion of talking about a a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife what my I let it play\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nOkay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and are\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you know you and your let's ... you don't use bullet you use a one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nWe'd have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down to squeal like a pig and then it so we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it to know how to do it\nNow that's still you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWild and what is it what's the proper ... we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force I'm like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound\nInsensitive don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings\nBut somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line it probably would push issue which or I'm Talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but\nThat's what it takes you don't think if one or two got hit that it would storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially storm the bullet storm that got and do you think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength or we just have to\n... even if there is a casualty or to the drive by half of their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah\nOkay so the alternative is still a lot of men\nNo no I have to hold a lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the closer legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just\nYeah oh okay All right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] a left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio\nRain again you're listening to the E R B network\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHomemade signs or helped me find them back home to my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews from kick their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that Holleman minds is completely free you\nGo home at ... dot com boy download the ... and\n... we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well\nOur investment advice is about to you it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life feeling secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you\nThe path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your news people financial advisor ... dot com that's S C I F ... with some company incorporated member S.

sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now Bible showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of Santa's last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the winning

moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and\nTexas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success because the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally in so far this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything for his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that never run one has want an open criticism for them\nAnd the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that you didn't look that up a would just be\nJust bad news horrible news at the exact worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackles a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and now suddenly has become a\nJust a static flat line\nJust a a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership and the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santas would be great defense is is a is a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nIn it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy\nTo me is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys the may have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have are\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president\nTells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved we we stole a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like Trump\nTweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt\nTransforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob\nSeven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be that you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished\nWhatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content\nOn your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups of victims\nAnd these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful or anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism\nThe Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way I mean this is just hands down at nist Andrew Gillum personified as personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe
