reading it or try to become conversant\nAnd it's just the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful\nAnd targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic\nThat the emphasis of

judiciary\nCommittee he has a I've never seen him this animate I've never seen the turtle is that I mean\nThis week the turtle and Grassley have been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess they send it to Schumer remind US Senator Feinstein and in this letter he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e M Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grassland his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you will surely would produce it as quickly as you could but you have\nDavid little refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so\nYou are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations I don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls the Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWill her lawyers did and that that she had seen a therapist and the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this\nAnd in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed a light attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations wiped away you have claimed\nSome reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices and Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ my and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating representative what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his what\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her whatever\nI mean he loaded for bear this is the kind of college out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken\nSenators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules and and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphones infant disease on it or are they the media\nPeople as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule by voting to confirm judges Kevin on the floor\nThat was during his or Senate floor remarks today in favor capital he was even singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats\nLike this fit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got\nAn email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh jihadists sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or anti Trump or is it's an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left out in ... and made fun of so I get a note from last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there\nThese areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did so for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six day in that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known results something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nWhich plays a role in the ... thing I'm kind of coffee ... reference mentioned something

is in a class by herself in men dasa they and and a number of other things just just [noise] not much redeeming there\nBut more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he's not confirmed accord stays uh for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch a leftist in charge of those issues in her state they're just shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly\nBe

up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the general camp
