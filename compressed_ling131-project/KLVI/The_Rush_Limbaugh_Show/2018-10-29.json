you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by it's not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that

to claim the victims had nothing else [laughter]\nOne of the reason I ask you\nSpecific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's it's anti that religion it's not anti Iran they still need the race in order to have racial politics but it's if I had that religion\nIn time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think you can and that you know any any time you're\nJewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out no way that I said this flame or I'm Jewish\nBut I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that ... that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an Orthodox Jew and other branches hot on\nAny different flavor [laughter] um yeah but I\nI I don't I used to I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian Tito um I don't\nEven necessarily being seeing Islam but I you know but I think it's the it's a it's like\nThis that's exactly right this is wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else

it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it\nSo this event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things
