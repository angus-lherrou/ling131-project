privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states added up a state where we may reside which means the draft or is that the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents is so important quote this\nMeeting the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors\nForeign ministers it was expressly invented the first citizenship to

I I have at times I've marvel that this country is held together the way it has for many years as if has given the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of ...\nThe U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason they didn't make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind a profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies\nGeneration after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm\nIn junior high intramural football in softball that nobody won that there were no outs in a baseball just nope no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child like snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nAnd right now it's rooted in the failure to accept\nThe results of an election\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand who Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part

since the sixties and it's it's it's I'm\nA ... ... it it it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they team sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery or the southern states work except that so they passed laws are closed up we're still restricted the plaques\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game that we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that they do sweat coach were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that\nIn a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he will be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents\nIt was expressly\nWritten chicken first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration and you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're ... our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing\nThe constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate gone surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company got we got to do this when we got to do that and\nIf it's being set up that's

for all that you do for us yes your bath friction with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah [laughter] look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has\nI don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones and it was on the door or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but\nThere isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships of one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ...\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand it as if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal

their political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violence has a very serious thing to do that\nThe hottest terrorists lone wolf carries

street there's always you don't want is rooted in folks it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms\nOf this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I am yours has been golly and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in\nThe presumption ups superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his motors is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other but\nYou you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laughed at or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nAny respect whatsoever then this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly can tell you how do you think or tell your window go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd that we've even got never Trump conservatives are out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down to you know what I keep the essence of things that ...\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it in the fact that they can't talk you out of
