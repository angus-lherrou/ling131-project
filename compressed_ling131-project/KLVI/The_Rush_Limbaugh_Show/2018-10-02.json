away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house I don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of

I understand the thinking but he just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why do we have to in order to win I never understood that why do we have to lose\nKevin in order to gin up turnout I [noise] depending on how it would happen I'm not sure when general turnout anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and they go to the voters say we're the majority and we tried we tried but we couldn't get him confirmed you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in the\n... there there's a disconnect there [noise]\nAnybody ever heard the name of Chris theme watcher named Christine fair Dr Carroll Christine fair anybody heard of her\n[noise] let me tell you who she is she is an associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown Georgetown's not an insignificant university Georgetown has the in fact Georgetown University\nWas the nucleus the center of the movement to give a women as much contraceptive help as possible birth control pills as far as I could see Georgetown was the center of that movement\nAnd this ...
