last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking\nAt the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the

it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is\nThat Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease

negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nPro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data\nBut we're never going

perhaps you have a pension with a lump sum option and you're not certain if that's the best way to take it\nSo my point is that that not as many people are seeing them and and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this was the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will power is at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time these are people that are up ... am happy they are excited to be where they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally in your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was\nIt was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids are slowing and the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon\nRight I can get banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get in\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the west the army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing that was inspiring or promoted wanting to be part of the Trump rallies or the exact\nOpposite\nAnd I don't mean that people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people and they're they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event\nAnd even if you do have some happy people and the Democrats sponsored have been audio doing in the last war because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a

you don't give power do an angry oh by the way that word mob the left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss or on dictionaries in a wicked PTO and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up there and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so used to having it throw in the right back at him with the same force they'd dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized\nAnd they really can't stand being laughed at all [noise]\nSo now Dianne Feinstein lock her up I Want to go back to two thousand

that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nThey\nDo not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable\nAnd predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\nIt's amazing the things they get away with the idea that the Republican Party he eats half the

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern of such behavior\nMayor told\nElle magazine her recollection of the Thomas hearings is J's yeah so having watched this before I knew the key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors and that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff there wasn't a pattern\nThis is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story but was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from Boise Ford or be it for ... or ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitted yeah we made up a second story well than use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story a legend in and of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it you\nKnow we needed to show a pattern here is a Christopher Smith Ohio your next I'm graduated high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you [laughter] thank you\nUm so I was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thought invention that's a little bit yesterday but with this mob rule as it is and Hillary claiming that they're hurting neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried with the mom and they left and they act in it\nAnd then fattening or if things begin to help people\nUm it just had me worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything for a child on fire but Trump stickers in our yard on our cars because we truly are the silent majority we're not out there", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "10"}
