Mohammed bin some modest the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he hasn't been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the so are they the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis\nAre not involved in one of the things that Mohammed does Oman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google

driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without mail it company but it's made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past the last I think it was this\nSummer he arrested the elite of the elite of Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over the Ritz Carlton\nHotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding\nA certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do to corruption and connections in someone's he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin so I'm not\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it\nThis reportedly has not set

and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so why was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to do but they just keep doing the same market and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when there are\nRight lose it when we're silent and they they are so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media uh well ... conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats\nLying yup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs if we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win a landslide because they know that if they can to

is Trump calling in to Fox and friends today is talking to Steve do see a do she said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time either make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected by it and we had it under the great control I don't think really\nBig was very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up that expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick them and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's worked for us to discuss things safe for them to make your is a very dangerous day for older [noise] what is held in contempt by Congress older when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they get settled the IRS just settle that case are older is he's got some problems\nNot used to be totally do like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge or or they would\nSay so we\nStrongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric co authored by a attorney general holder written and it's but but but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely a unilateral condemning\n\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] [noise] that I can tell you that I can you better be careful what he's wishing\nNow the stock market's been kind of the song it's been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something books there are a number of wealthy\nDemocratic Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced would willingly take a bit of a financial hit\nTo their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant lowering\nYou cannot make activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it flies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking aren't\nPulling people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's all [noise] when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression when is the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with plenty of money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm\nPaying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the\nFederal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so for renting\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump for him to know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know much at\nTommy leftists as they are many financial institutions and not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of drunk\n\nSo Trump calling them out on it they said there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election is why things down so they react to it\nAnd and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up

there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are working are there are some that I Am a not in love with yes and what we've done out slowly but surely\nService some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get lakes I think a lot of the lake so not links that made up by the newspapers the media is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even a letter written to the times that there is a chance there is a very good chance that that was written by the times I wouldn't be surprised 'cause the times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote that\nPiece that memo that pose a memo written by an angry staffer\nIn the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal things the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we loved it\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this\nAnd they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first day we'll have to go back and check the transcript\nBiting it was the first day I told everybody I don't believe this I think the times made this up I think they wrote it and they're telling us

election results is this not hilarious looking back let's let's retrace steps it was the last debate\nBetween the Trump stir and the hill the beast and Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results and Trump said no\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes we've counted the votes\nThey wanted I think what was the objective was\nTo be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections\nThat's what they were hoping for\nThe Trump will you know is it going up the results of the election of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was gonna win in a landslide then they the soundbite would be on the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat the upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up and said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight\nHillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that where your memory\nDidn't believe in saying there's this is an unwritten so then Obama we didn't know until recently\nDevised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens then your staff and the Obama White house\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be ... during his final debate with Clinton and October the nineteenth he said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nThan roads seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo Lisa rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating be election results\nSo this is not funny looking like they're hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was gonna win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ... and\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were going to get them to validate the election results\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell and cause a laser rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have fun resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed\nThey hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're gonna use it\nIf Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that was going to validate her election even more\nThat was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russian that's what their plan was\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russian stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nThis story New York magazine they think
