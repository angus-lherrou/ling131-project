what does this site I Can't tell what this site is it it's um [noise] any weight identifies\nIt as a member of the Green Party a yet these got pictures of Trump and he's got GOP stickers all over the uh\nThe window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they\nDon't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRecipients that I also Fox\nIt was just reporting the law enforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab\nTo study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here\nAnd a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this one everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking between now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you\nSo there's going to be a daily use of information on what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy\nIdentifying the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh the\nNarrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what a matters that same thing is happening today with the economic news we ever GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so that Dr buys are reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy there's\nNothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic\nGrowth is it didn't come into the into predicting three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath\nSpecifically Google also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly\nDisappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though\nIt's trying to get a ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still chugging right along with the drive bodies are reporting the day\nThat it has slowed down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican\nMomentum going into the midterms nobody talks about this yesterday this was a I thought a left wing media\nNarrative that had been created but apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump\nToday complained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the the scare has distracted from news about the germs and even Sloan Republican momentum said\nRepublicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's his tweets\n\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody\nNobody has you know like this is I sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it\nAnd if there isn't any knows about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the\nHeavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ahead I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic\nIn the poll Ron Santa has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable poll it's a big deal\n\nAnd so ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does\nAffect what people think their their perceptions of ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is a is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I say it's a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for them in terms\nHis tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper went to Trump's tweet well somewhat nonsensical\nReally help to know who wrote this suggest the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs or a Democrat operation that get out the vote\n\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to to to to cover up any news or anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans are Trump for being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um make it make it appear like the Democrats are\nBehind this it will just have to let time unfold on this is a little frustrating trying to get all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself and I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just going to be patient was just going to wait and as I learn things that I can personally confirming\nVouch for and what have no

or think you know about all of the various political players involved here\nAnd do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democratic party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous what has been\nDone in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign lying to the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia that Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began George Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned that\nIn these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to

Australia at a bar in London\nAnd ambassador to step in options you know I\nTold the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary\nEmails so this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told him well they planted it in his head\nHe didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation go get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back\nWe don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to
