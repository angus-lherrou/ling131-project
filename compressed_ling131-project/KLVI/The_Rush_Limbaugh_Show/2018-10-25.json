John Brennan echoing that how\nTo move forward forward at fighting the low road President Trump at the highlights what Clinton said last week they tend to have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hands here yet on a top actually trying to blame all all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this I'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears river just a bit to talk about the caravan\n'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to CNN and I caught the governor of Ohio there\nJohn Case it and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border\nAnd there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who are legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter you know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal now\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us\nThat we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go alive Phil Donahue used to do with all the time Phil Donahue and hosts the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nYou know I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look the difference it's made for me and if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt\nHow the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo want to other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answered the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nOf others and that we don't have the right to
