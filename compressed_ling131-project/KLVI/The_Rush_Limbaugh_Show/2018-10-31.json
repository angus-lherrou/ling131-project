trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind\nOr tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up to election there's a big deal psychologically until you these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it and it's holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time\nSpite the factor in any evidence more than that\nWe don't want you we don't want your wife we don't want your Jewish pretend daughter we don't want your joints son in law we don't want any of you here go away but\nTrump goes to the hospital where the professionals treated the wounded and gets very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\n[noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you get it the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in a story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there is a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what Paul and you look at I don't care what professional you talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling data the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows bottom line\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good word you know why I think it was [noise] was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve\nWas one of those two elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money and that seat won the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he is intolerable\nSince that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver distaste than when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat ... the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll only does this analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poke in the polling company he's never run a campaign and condos point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nTo guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be true and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this is like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blob vi and to become flat line and it's hard\nI I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump threat to end the or the birthright citizenship\nToday the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it isn't then you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting in the countries that can't Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all of this Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does made it\n\nIt is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing we have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by\nPeople who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded in the snow complicated mistreated this this is what it is that's who the opponents are very hell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come back to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia you know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak or did they will be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is somebody's running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time that they\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him of some kind\nOr tried to or what have you all oh I Know as the that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say in the days and weeks leading up to election there's a big deal psychologically until you these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it and it's holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time\nSpite the factor\nIn any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen in between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant rising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about trust\nAs a writing that story up as though the Conyers ticked off at Trump that's not

talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover it\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what what is your reaction to this I mean this folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean a specific of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the left as concerned as white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view of the American left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration in a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery as the primary\nEvidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan and immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly one has energized and filled of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood into a she\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching\nIf you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things and\nSo on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority of media you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this\nWhile they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is Monday Night also that he doesn't see\nDemocrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders had\nBeen defended and explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well there are cops and they mistreating they're racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was just intending to wound to people Steve squeeze almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\n\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc Muslim Americans\nIn fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\nTwo days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went\nThat [noise] yeah where did I go down\nAnd not leaders Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is following I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link that the Trump a good point\nThere is no way to link to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking\nDay how I'm not I'm not joking and all they don't care about it because it has no impact has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when the other side of the time to attack a corporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just got to remember CNN go when wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in the last place out there\nAnd uh this was that was pre Trump and the the the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV so they believe and then they had a mystery where it is a damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even ask a former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemember that you remember that\n... certainly remember that ... ...\n... but they they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall\nWith it and it became a standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success\nIs to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google\nCNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what you want to wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning boarded the

brand new planet now\nWhat are you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was he was bullied will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be the one of the um you know somewhat but ah and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's still a brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out\nTo the sea sucked into it I'll tell you

make a case\nAh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... so\nThat no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way

other business out there\nAny other retail business I think the news business has people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does don't know if one\nI don't know of a business who who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit that it was is\nAssuming and then operating on the assumption that whatever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks for everybody cares about well I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf that momentum was interrupted ... imaging level declines in wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Ford miners\nAfford my sounds of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlanned between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking and get a lot of this idea that all of this

election day and I don't believe anybody else does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe what do you not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close we don't know we never know until the aftermath here's\nTrump tweeting out at Paul Ryan port riots would be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic said Trump comes out gets a conversation started on a lemon dating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do the ad that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth than there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus if it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why\nAsking some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why\nIs it why is it when he gives it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\n\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today\n[noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the\nKavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the Ford with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial Rick we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any\nBut the media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets conference get ... get the confirmation vote and isn't sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah well if Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all it just it's going on is it not\nMollie\nHemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credit that'll leave all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political none\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital of us accused of being was actually cruise they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there's a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions the reason those questions are being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true\nIt was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end of a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth\nShe would have been one of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made public\nThing I'd do it terrify here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was\nConvenient this whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents\nThey still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign and we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women\n[noise] well I'm Sorry for your loss\nSo I I guess you'd like for me to say a few words them\nGuys you are never gonna believe who kicked the bucket\nFox News I'm Chris foster President Trump tweets about house Speaker Paul Ryan who should be

beats a minute during this program that's more than when I exercise course exercise for me as a relevant thing\nUh back to the phones we go to Minnetonka, Minnesota this is a Ella image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much ... when my call\nI was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my class has caused courses because I couldn't handle how they had Wi Fi American history [noise] the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is one needs and millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way it can make crafts on getting now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nIs specially looking at their eyes they take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trek karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNow wants to ship Dr performed has examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any one quick not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to you and tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who could work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets with tape\nWith gold and then I found out I was going to be the one paved streets\nBut we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will hold a lot of everybody not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about kind of history he's gonna be learning it so I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books\nTo oh wow you know very was\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history ... all revised they give even a paragraph maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph to Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties\nDid a survey of the most popular high school history textbooks and found one paragraph in reference they rambling one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in in American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so\nOver Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe we're a much newer and younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was Rick wired that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the image\nFive sixty K O we are\n\nKnow if you remind me I'm I'm getting quite a few emails want me to comment on Apple's events yesterday the new I ... some of the stuff [noise] I'll just\nTell you this you don't wanna get the biggest applause I watched and it was ten o'clock in the morning yesterday normally it's at one o'clock you know one got the biggest applause of the entire Ninety five minute\nPresentation they introduce new ... new life heads are pretty cool but are you what do you think you'll never guess\n... if I told you every new product that they announced you still would not guess what got the loudest and most sustained applause of any announcement [noise]\nAre you ready when apple announced that the new ... book is made of one hundred percent recycled aluminum\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect of it would be as good as most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who've been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact that Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was big news of the day\nHoly smokes now let's go to the audio sound like this\nThis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by a hundred protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not support what one does\nImmigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Columbus hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come in every did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump first lady\nYou'd walk a Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shooting that\n\nNow they got a bachelor you reach\nYour anger again\nThank you so much [laughter] I Can't keep having

much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jake Tapper sued the protest they're not surprised nobody wanted the president there and it's not just Jake Tapper\nEverybody in a drive by Mr President your ship trip and I thought this was not your place you know business going they don't want you to forty five thousand people signed a petition asking\nHim not to come\nOr wait we're not

everybody laughing about it but what is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program it this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants to NATO property where she everybody hates ... everybody's spices Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait to vote for Democrats so the\nTrump can't do anything and everybody wants the Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that's your drive by media\n[noise]\nThey don't show you the reaction of real people you will not see those videos you will not fear that audio anywhere\nElse or to reduce the number one person that will be appalled by Rush Limbaugh muggy like be\nA five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight [noise]\nFully funds President Trump's border wall\nExpands Cape ... to ... women\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right to

Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was Don ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey ended up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose\nThe\nMost heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their poll\nAnalyst and data analyst there is Sean ... day I'm not going to read the whole thing it printed out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as mint terms and her final stretch\nNominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a bunch of polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend that they've toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democratic majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that paid\nThe Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here that the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states or the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know those are my words\nAnd on his ... his words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races in ... the ... of numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slam Republican but wait here's our these predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on the street print day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... to be can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter]\nBut that's just me into being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality a penny is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest but what about the Nineteen\nRepresentative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the\nOr he isn't is it going to matter what\nApproval number is in some of these house races or is it not [noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here leads to reexamine things\n[noise] and then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money and to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge it Ted Cruz but it has\nSince filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning cover liable aren't on this thing\nAnd then the next ... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant which is why I continue to rail against\nPolls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens what good at the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob oil and Georgia seventh or\nWe don't however no how big a problem that says right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of prices regardless of whether that happens\nWe are well set up for such an eventuality bottom line I happen to live this idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognized as one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up with as much intelligence analysis\nAnd this is Jean valor Randy from that's the bottom line Don ... minute I bring it to you each Saturday from six AM to seven AM and Sundays from eleven to twelve right here on five sixty K.
