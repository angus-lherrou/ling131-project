banned still crews and it's going to be performing silent auction relate is great time\nWill tell people a little bit about the harbor foundation\nFor the Harvard Foundation was put together to give back to families that may be facing life limiting illness says and really help them I'm On the non medical side there's a lot of needs that come up for families that can't be met um you know by medical insurance and they still have those\nSo that where it was really developed to help the families we transition into we we give it a lot of grants back into the community to nonprofits here in southeast Texas so that they can carry on their missions and help the families that we also served together so\nLast year we gain a grant to the nutrition service center to help them continue their mission\nBecause I'm a lot of our families that we're taking care of our getting those meals at home so really a joint effort to put that money back into community\nWhere there are so many great organizations and you know with Harvey last year we all experience I mean nationally they saw how we come together as a community to take care of one another and ah\nYou know but in nutrition services for seniors just one of those great organizations there's so many of them out there that are that are the unsung heroes people don't necessarily think about 'em every day but the big impact they make here in southeast Texas but all of that requires investment from the community donations\nAnd so y'all put something together to help\nCome up with funds for such organizations\nYes there and this is one of our big sign right there is to be able to have that money to be able to put back in the community so we didn't want people to come out and support the cause there's a lot of fun things going on that evening for everyone I just uh you know get together and celebrate life and really promote the community\nWell and harbor hospice the the company a that is something you know hospice\nFor years ago twenty Thirty years ago people would associate hospice with just the near end of right of life but now hospice care can start a lot sooner than that as people have gotten older and I experience with my dad and found that it you know the services that a hospice off versus is significant\nYes there were really able to help families you know we want families too you know be able to get us included sooner than at the last minute you know the regulations have changed a lot we're able to help these families when they really are needed most when they stopped treatment and\nAnd one that comfort they want to be in their home or we have our facility on major drought that ... people through a crisis that they may be in during this time\nWell and besides the healthcare crisis and losing someone there's usually all kinds of associated challenges that are happening with that just because of life's happening every day with that\nAnd so having those resources and finding a an ear to listen to that also maybe have some familiarity with that can can help you with that so um you know and so often I I've just noticed the evolution in the in that industry and for people that\nAre are of my age there sometimes and education just in terms of the different services the additional services that are offered and how much difference it can make\nA in terms of making people more comfortable as a that time in life\nIs are we don't just take care of the patient we take care of their family to we have the spiritual services we have social services so it's a really a holistic approach to their care at this time and their need\nAnd so how do people go about getting more information for the upcoming of that\nSo our website it's going to be harbor foundation dot com and the

didn't have any and she goes out and announces this\nSo she is one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian industry trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand it to include South America when other reason there isn't much into your DNA is because they are\nVery very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit injured they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA be cause they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA\nIf any of this but ... the\nMedia of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lying separatists inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate future debate and\nThat's what he meant that she wouldn't do any better that she wouldn't show up at Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go insane and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there was going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive\nLandslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but if you look at the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years\nOf Obama do you go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms the Democrat Party who lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses\nA governorships a you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats\nThey were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election they continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot shouldn't run ever going to sweep big never going to wipe\nOut the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continued to lose to the point that after the two thousand six needle elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nFor rock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess other Democrat Party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped\nThe trend the people in this country had been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says\nThe Democrat Party well on the basis of what\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth is no reason to vote against that\nIn common sense there is no real Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary and in fact\nThere's a story from CNBC today that you're not gonna see widely reported let's see if it was a [noise] probably would see him be ... survey soaring\nEconomic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand Eighteen this is the CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in American\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs\nOpen that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one\nWith that many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees\nCan set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience on whatever it is they're applying for\nNone of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told\nThat the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote and yet\nThere isn't a middle Lincoln bits of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six game presidential election\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nKill VR is available everywhere you want to listen on our free I heart radiolab download it now [noise]\nNow by somebody who am I trying to squeeze it in here somebody to do some thinking I'm going to expand on this of course but but I I'm thinking nothing is chances for rock Obama ruins the Democrat Party but rock Obama\nIs no reason that they lost twelve hundred seats nationwide there hasn't been anything to change that they lost the Supreme Court they lost Kavanaugh they did everything they could do\nA mounted October surprise they tried to destroy the life for career in the past the future of Brett Kavanaugh to save the court nothing\nIs going their way they're not winning meanwhile what's happening on the Republican side many of you may hate hearing it something you'd never Trump is but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen the Democrats attempt on Capitol\nThe Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing I'll probably the first standing in his career\nIn front of\nA of a stadium or arena sized crowds\nI guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation dad he simply is not used to hasn't I mean it nobody else liked the turtle in our party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely by\nHolding steady in this fine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment of Kevin on the Republican Party not all of it what it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats

verse that's considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nFind the time it's attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied Pocahontas this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American DNA\nThe Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr Carlos\nMost of them on to a use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in

could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is pathetic\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every now they're saying that\nWhat Bill Clinton did with Monica limit no no no no no no that was not abuse that doesn't qualify me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the

embarking on what\nA stadium tour or yes bill\nAnd Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium to or\nWhere they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage because of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do and anybody can do it they're going to try to\nGet in on it there's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like people care what\nTrump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor that Trump has\nThe Hillary certainly does and they haven't never has had you could

going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw ... campaign up there and that's why she didn't do very many of them it
