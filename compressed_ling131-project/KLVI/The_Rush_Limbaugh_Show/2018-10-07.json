experience and you know people more comfortable whenever it set up inside or we can bring the bus salad as scheduling of works out that way\nI'm most blood drives are either between three and four hour sometimes are longer than that if we have a group that's larger\nUm but in that short span of time we we try to collect as many as we can from people that are going to take some time to get out and give\nWell and ah as you talked about it doesn't take any more than thirty minutes to give blood and a and there's some testing that goes on right there when you go to give blood\nYeah you get a little mini physical we'll check your blood pressure will check your eye he my credit which is your our level make sure that you're healthy and and ready to donate to answer a series of quick a screening questions\nUm and then after you donate you're given a donor id number which you can log in to our website and get your cholesterol level as well and of course the information that we took

row successfully speaks volumes\nUm our Veterans Day Dr usually we collect upwards of fifty sixty in it so right there that's taking care of a day\nWell well and also for if you're a part of a community organization or a business this is something that you need to give some folks to get that into a routine within the organization or within the business\nWe rely heavily on our community

NAFTA Canada Canada which said they want to know part of it they ask in the last moment hey don't forget us can we be finding this to prompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaning into terrorist jumps in hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\nRemember\nHow to drive ... and the Democrats and the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was\nGonna provoke chai comes it couldn't possibly be good at might mean the end of what ever range or making what the North Koreans it might destroy existing good relations with the child comes\nUp up breaking news China just cut import tariffs on a wide range of products China\nBut trying comes we'll cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including steel products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the ... finance ministry yesterday\nThe checkouts have pledged to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tensions with those some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work\nAnd it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one I thought it was necessary to do and it's now done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our jobs even more than the throughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than I maybe forty five minutes or you know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions for the Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of\nAmerican leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies and Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy that doesn't mean because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs in their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nPeople about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance and the details of this new\nIt just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as a noun Singh is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they were talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us\n[noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... or in the\nRespect of authors it's up to us just show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump is turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile\nTo be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them to do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody\nIt's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come down and I as I say it's ... it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize\nWe really we really haven't it's you know you can see evidence and scientists on our own culture of the achieved any accomplished somehow people need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it as some\nSort of a new definition of humility\nRather than having used as a teachable moment if something inspiring is this Trump points out we want every country making their country great we want every country putting our country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for\nEverybody to do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nOr don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget it was ... Hussein ... who said none of this could be done\nIf you remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore essentially\nWe're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore now just the opposite going to be a manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of ... fair trade issues\nSo there you have it it's um it's not a sexy subject NAFTA never was him and it was in command and a lot of attention a it was very controversial when it was ratified in the in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties\nBut in terms of being a subject of cable news announcer going to do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people tune in\nIt's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden to David people get its importance in terms of its important as an election issue it's crucial\nIt is um I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it could be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject of World Trade don't doubt me and in that sense\nIt's a confidence inspiring that Trump left alone in the oval office free and clear to be who he is will man ... bunch of great\nAnd Dianne Feinstein and basically told the media that as far as he's concerned they are the Democrat Party to\nHe talked about Blumenthal lying for years about having served in Vietnam when he had never even been to that country served with valor as a marine said this guy\nA serial wire on his resume is questioning Brett Kavanaugh and he went on to talk about Cory Booker who was admitted to fondling women in an herb that by the way that was an attempt\nTo cleanse himself to show them he has reformed when they went on to accuse Feinstein\n... of leaking that Christine ... for the letter he did this Saturday Night of West Virginia and it was hilarious the way he thinks he knows that Dianne Feinstein ... I\nDon't have time to explain it I might have to show for those you watching on the dental cam I'll do my best to show you what Trump did he imitated Feinstein when the whole question of leaking came up and he's now they're asking if\nYou looked at was drunk and high school does that mean your nomination and Trump is talking to the\nWe'll get going here hang on a\nCollision and plastics five ten I'd in South twenty three twenty four collision and classics body shop a collision technology repairs center\nWhere the last ... last night and ... and that means green who is this for you classes like ... all about it last fall into this I went down in finance and telling\n\nI'm Debbie hand like a tragic crash in upstate New York twenty people in the limousine and show harried New York were killed synergy Susan Collins announced he was voting yes for judge Brett Kavanaugh after reading the FBI report\nThere were a lot of rumors that only the four people at that tact her for mentioned dinner testimony would be intervene that was not the case I wrecked twelve ... ad on Thursday\nCollins was on CBS his face the nation Senator Ben Cardin says Democrats have concerns\nWe are very concerned about protecting the progress we've made on health care issues on women's constitutional rights on protecting the more investigation\nSenator Cardin on Fox News Sunday Fox News we were poor you decide [noise]\nWinning dodge we're all about family tradition [noise]\nFrom a young age we're taught that have strong ... is the foundation to us solid business relationship [noise]\nFrom start to finish you should see things through\nIs the key to better tomorrow [noise]\nWaiting for all nine to\nNine six thirty five hundred or see Winnie dodge dot com for more\nEvery mall you know or if it was a marine home\nSooner than are there who\nCan of\nHard for you can celebrate them nor\nYear round that's American ...

the players made their bets and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices tape resumes that much ... stops\nAt at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double dumped players go into gear making their beds have the final turn ... stops the tape of the horse race again asks the players if they want to make conditional bets or get out of ones they've made\nLayers do what they do that much ... resumes\nTaped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the ...\nStern at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is going to win yet look what you want to do what you were making bad humor and guessing some of your probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know\nBefore it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells

unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy and\nThen the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal\nWith this no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the Ford\nWill end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how

cops are bad every white cop as a rate every black convict is\nIn is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat Party he's happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they all ...\nAnd they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally it doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done
