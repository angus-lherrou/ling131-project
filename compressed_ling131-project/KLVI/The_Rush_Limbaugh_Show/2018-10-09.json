now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column\nNine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this okay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly or leaning Democrat I guess this is according to polling David [noise] two hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you and me and for the majority in the house\nOr four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTwo seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is [noise] and yet they believe it now folks\nI don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans you know I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other\nThat to nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an out some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine feet firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American\nVoters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this guy with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election\nNight two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... gosh for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAs I say we're hypothetically protest\nAnd this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than the alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started Lee said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching you know you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and and\nUh the\nShow started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage\nAnd the FDU cops are running around trying to prove this guy is a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know officer you know our\nGovernment money is separating the two parents that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this uh well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informants smarter but that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learn and people with Avon so load block ad idiots\nProbably best known for throwing Washington's best dinner parties during Democrat presidency's\nDuring Republican presidents these nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John tower\nThat's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently [noise] Don Juan running around the Senate and just that everybody that got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend them while telling him he needed to resign one of them was um [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget is attempt saving the reputation of John\nTower I knew John Powell\nI think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only but I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\nCocoa get a picture of the guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here and show you a little camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise] well\nAnyway Sally Quinn says John Tower once assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John toddler\nBasically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo and drivers well anyway she starts it happened in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax it you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDrag now where did this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me\nAnd basically tried to soften the and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and I was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time\nAnd the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car and Senate screech to a halt in front of our quarter is and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot God\nBut I went in the house at night I cried all night long I Would absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um\nBut but you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more bite we got Times Square here here's another reason why number forty three when I\nThink about it I thought I'm so glad I didn't do it because I could have been Anita Hill and Anita Hill's life has been completely ruined destroyed don't went ahead and they're gonna be the person who was in that hearing having to talk about these disgusting thing Christine seizing Ford's name came out against her well she didn't want to be there and what I think\nIs that if I had been Anita Hill and I'd known better I wouldn't have done it at five than Christine ... Ford she didn't expect it to go public but I Would have not done it\nBecause their lives have been ruined it posted buzzy for just got an alumni an award from UNC Chapel Hill for this and she got to get movies or do the hills life has not been ruined or destroyed Sally what world are you looking at\n'em anyway [noise] uh\n...
