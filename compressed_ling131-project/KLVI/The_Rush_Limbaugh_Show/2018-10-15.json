I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have\nYou heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why\nIt's not it's just not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years if Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance\nOf the elections uh the the the drive by us have their formula and\nIt's rooted in the desire they have it everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result\nPolling data and says the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a white realize what a mistake they made voting for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patriots hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in the history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get\nBy for the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly in the midterms\nI still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union why it was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile sounds hot he always has some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily went in with than the stupid country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like NATO then is fine\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course\nIn the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want to so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves\nAnd this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring point that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it it will review says he's going to do something he's going to do or\nHigh school football season alive all season by markets and best of luck Neal involved only saw by thinking kale he wanted\nAmerican Center there are no\n... there's no registration fees have making strides walks out or slash se T.

War three now is not truth my frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay I Know unless you're not to try it again I Know and and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage\nOf white and general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice it sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but\nTrump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get they can sneak up on people\nAnymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got an a roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest in true as anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussion is in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell him about my opinions of the ... he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media is until I ran for president I had no idea I\nBeing really serious with you he said and I I think that's probably\nTrue as a New Yorker and emerged in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kinda like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked I was really surprised this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that is true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but thought he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you and I did but now since he suffered the treatment he fully\nRush Limbaugh middle of\nThe fees

of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or ...\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out of the foreign me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many
