Turkey apple has not yet brought LT each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means\nThat there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the ... there was no way\nYou know\nIts its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours away from it I got a golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards and most of which would be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there's no way his watch\nWas recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under guilty they still need to be prepared to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording\nIt doesn't start ... it can store I think up to a hundred songs maybe more now but for the most part has to stream them it's not an independent device so the there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in

saying\nThe way they're saying it's it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and Android remain paired to the iPhone you can't be

if the secret audio taken of Claire McCaskill and her campaign aide Rob meals I this is\nThis is important because this new is just not being reported in Missouri which is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state that what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new laws of the secret video from project maritime Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nThere are tests news have been reported\nSo we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ me the Breitbart News you know cure report back there is no way piece here why there's no New York times here there's no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat\nEven though they know publisher and fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here there's no Saint Louis TV station matches I don't know about Kim Alexis St Louis but we're covering that by doing it now um there's nothing in Yahoo News nothing\nNot one drive by or mainstream media outlets shows up\nIn a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project verite sauce every site running this would be\nA conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers at these stations here\nAnd what it basically is is McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters and the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly said that says whatever age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified\nProject Barrow toss secret journalist and in this particular soundbites Senator McCaskill are talking about in the end the project ... secret journalist they're talking about the second

I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript\nShe said if we have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get my son his gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows\nHe just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are total NRA folks\nThe Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\nI voted for getting rid of ... what what about high capacity

limiting bags and\nBanning things more on on or you can't say might lose votes in the Boot Hill but you know what she said about that she said if we can really sweep up in St Louis if we can\nClean up the story I could I could lose some votes in the boot heel so your people in the Boot Hill in Missouri and that's where my mom when my mom was born in Arkansas but she grew up in\nKennett, Missouri
