{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "This this campaign you don't have to be the c._e._o. of the company you don't have to be you know it it is it's open to anybody at any level to participate as long as they have that passion to give back and be part of something like this it's it's for you so\nIt was a lot of media becomes a great vehicle for us to be able to get the word out as well as radio and everywhere else and y'all are killing it on Bush wanted to remind folks that you know you know it is so important\nCancer itself has there's probably nobody is listening to their lives hadn't been touched by somebody that's gotten cancer absolutely and if that's unfortunately the truth and and the American Cancer Society does so much\nWe do um we are a national organization but we do services right here in South these taxes and I'd love to explain what we do because so many people know are named sure but not everybody knows exactly what we do we provide once a cancer diagnosis is is determined\nThey turned to us for help and support and services um\nYou know when people are going through chemo and radiation they lose their hair and especially women all we want to our hair is a big deal to us all we want to do is being a feel normal again so we offer free wigs and head coverings right through our office there a bright behind Hobby Lobby\n[noise] we offer rides to treatment to and from treatment will pick people up at their doorstep bring them to their cancer treatment and return them to their home because up people there's a lot of people that don't feel up to physically up to go into their cancer treatment or\nThey can't afford the gas to get to their cancer treatment so we help out in those ways we have a lodging program ah where we can uh provide a\n... an overnight stay to someone coming from a great distance\nA lot of time for the same reasons gas and just the physical aspects of the cancer treatment takes a toll on people and they don't feel like making that track back home brought it that same day ah we are building the nation's largest health lodge\nThat will open in in about a year or year and a half depending on when they're you know their construction gets going\nUm we're at the very end of a thirty million dollar capital campaign wow\nThat ah we're just about ready to open a you know break they've already broken ground but they they've got grants that are now kicking in and it's going to be close to Seventy rooms um and it's a ... a bricks and mortar place for people are undergoing cancer treatment\nAnd their caregivers family members friends can stay with them at no cost\nUm during their treatment so we're super proud that that's happening on the horizon real real soon and I really believe that this is going to help a lot of people in this area who are making that um that trip up and down interstate ten\nWhich can literally bankrupt a family going through cancer trade treatment because you've got gas hotel rocking food you know you name it\nAll wrong with our bare hands are trained people are missing work and everything oh yeah on top of that\nSo it's it's a it's a great thing we we also do um support programs called we have several look good feel better is one where we teach people the importance of uh taking care of yourself through your treatment um if the physical it's battling the physical um\nAspects of having cancer your skin changes you need to take care of your your scan um proper nutrition proper rest and as women\nA lot of us when we're all we're so busy taking care of everybody else we forget about are so so that's a real important program um the lodging I mentioned navigation support information rise to and from treatment we do all that locally\nBut our research program is quite honestly I in my opinion the most important thing of what we do because there's no way we all shot to the rooftops that we want to cure let's here there's no way we're going to find a cure unless we find cancer research we have to further that mission\nAnd continue and continue funding research because that's how we're going to get there and currently we have Ninety One million dollars right now\nInvested in jest breast cancer research alone well that's just one\nType of cancer that we are funding that much money into research because we feel that strongly about that you know that keeping going forward with the research um so we can find those treatment drugs and medicines and everything that Britain discover those breakthroughs that's going to get us there\nRight well and I know the local oncologist as well as the ones in Houston they do a great job recommended people to reach out to the American cancer say do you know because you need that emotional support as well because it is it's so much more than just the physical disease and\nIt takes ... on the individual that has cancer as well as the family so it does being in a community that understands and you can talk to them that is a can't be replaced\nAbsolutely and I I didn't know this till this year but\nWe are ... I did not know that we are conducting cancer research right here in South east Texas Texas oncology is doing that yeah so the way that works as a physician or a scientist can apply for a grant through us and we can fund their study and that makes me so proud knowing that we could find a researcher right here in South east Texas\nWith other people get in touch with you forever to push\nThey just call her office at a forum nine nine two four zero five seven six and they\nCan sign up a team effort making strides that making strides walk dot O.

[laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that I Wonder\nWhere they heard that idea of what we don't know you ought to be your shoes are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the ... for the midterm elections\nIt is a interesting question\nThough will any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's I'm a Democrat site it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this\nOn the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left you have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad insane crazy percolating\nCompounding come pressing all of this ever since they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen and this Kavanaugh situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side\nThey can get any more hysterical and I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin offered her ... she wants to see the F. B. I.\nDocuments released she wants a full fledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking you're talking about Gerald ... House Judiciary committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're going to impeach cabin or they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this subside this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging\nIn what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I don't even try like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks that I've that I don't I don't want to fall back on that suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a Democrat voters is less than what we think\nIt is just because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddle their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control\nAnd losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware\nOf the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad insane this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but\nFor those that don't get it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party in representative of\nThe ah the party at large here's J Christian Adams writing it PJ Media Kavanaugh photos fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo but there's any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited the hospitals for the seriously mentally\nIll and the shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery weren't as odd and on earth weight as anything I ever heard in ... and a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning dude\nAnd then the role was called but it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting how willing screaming in an under recognized the bowl venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was rage\nWas hate it was poisoned in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit\nLunatics these were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to themselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least\nBit concerned about it the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large it doesn't seem to worry at all this kind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\n\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in to not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics envy insane face to face\nBut what it means to me is I don't know that they can get more rabbit\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen to get them more fired up than they are\nSteven cold beer\nHas a writer on his staff that show couldn't to curb without writers

to react to what they think\nHas gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is a you know John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you know this piece was about this piece was about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because all the Democrats are

Senate races it's interesting in the CNN polling data the generic ballot I I'm just going to tell you don't get dispirited by this because it's it's a it's it's CNN\nBut on the generic ballot in the CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground but in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening now to plus Thirteen that I I just I\nMaybe it's my desire maybe it's my hope but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus an west the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter now to balance that it makes sense that way\nI just I I find it really hard to believe that after the last\nTwo to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent wants to Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\nI Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThat the first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the Jim this is standard operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of all the elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six\nWas an election certainly to the ... exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially\nI and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are the answer to what ails America\nNot the drive by whatever\nThey see it that way so they reported that way in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen margin advantage but then you look at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then the elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by a twenty eight point margin\nEven though the Democrats on the surface what seemed to have public opinion on their son says the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved\nOf further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independents disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compared to thirty percent who approved other\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by and narrower fifty three ... thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independence disapproved of ... he did it\nYou know big ... [noise]\nCan't prove anything\nAll I have to go on\nA experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct I'd just died on everybody believes is blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links\nLinks to on his page is a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\nWhere Republicans supposedly thinking the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast\nBig march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what\nI Know what what what ... well yeah I'd like\nTo get an individual Paul's visual nine percent of their nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the into the minutia I'm I'm just talking about over all national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I\nI'm One of these people you probably are too I'm only ... people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries if everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people that way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at the American way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we\nDo for a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly\nActing on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies these Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything\nHe's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is gonna kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative of the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous as they can be and they were the thing because there's not\nA one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... willing that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever\nBut certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies\nThere her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without\nSome aimed coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy envy\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\n... with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it\nJoe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that their embarking on a nationwide stadium toured\nTaking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this fall it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show\nIt'll feature the Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers in public service while also discussing\nOf the day and looking toward the future the tour is being sponsored by live nation wide nation also hosting a stadium tour for Michelle my bell\nThe Clinton turtle start in Las Vegas November Eighteenth that some day this was after the midterms it'll crisscrossed the country ending in Los Angeles next April tickets go on sale this Friday October to twelve and they're not cheap\nIf you want to see the Clintons joint speaking tour that Clinton stage show the Clintons national stadium to her at the park theatre in Las Vegas the cheapest seats will cost just over Seventy dollars where the Clintons are said to be more demand like Boston\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really

rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it\nWell let me share with you a headline from political Josh just today political story ready for this political race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic\nColumn only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome I'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their office is telling you they believe is\nOkay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats firmly or to leaving\nDemocrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight team is the number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nFor nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nWith this this is a wipe out the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this that and yet they believe it now folks\nI don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans and I I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington ... by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to print nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan ... sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the aisle or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or a new meaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\n\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election\nNight through thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump but the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started Lee says he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching them and you know this this last week was premier week for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU cops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order and\nYou know no no officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two words that are born or an eye\nOn them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watched and said well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informed smarter but that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\nDuring Republican Presidents Day is nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad\nTime but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's house and she was on a understand Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow\nSally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John Powell that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate just that everybody that got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend it while telling him he needed to resign one of them was a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget is attempt saving the reputation of\nJohn Cutler I knew John Powell I think John\nTower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only\nBut I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ... folks by reputation\n... go get a picture to guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught I'll Try to find one here in ... we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says that John Powell\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around on yellow cams\n[noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in ...\nJohn Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was a nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he drag\nNow where did this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically I tried to assault and the and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and\nThe cab driver would lie about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon Senate screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun\nBut I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn or assaulted by John Tower um but but

candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice that last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being with us it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept\nFor a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to\nDemocrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way\nAnd there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plans their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which\nThen of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white\nVoters what they have to do was change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly crusty on on on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws in reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take\nCases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most early example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional into the gas not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each\nOther we're not going to destroy each other Hillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christie on on on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy\nThem as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrats just announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they support it that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me and my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the hinged Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nPro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that\nReal if you want to believe polling data but\nWe're never going to get a poll of people who does approve of Democratic Party tactics techniques that poll is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back then it was quite harmful as Democrats they wouldn't run the results\nThey would get hold of Democrat leaders the media was saying look this is not working you guys you better get hold of your people dialing back the problem is the Democrats\nThe likes of her short would sure if that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]\nAnd you'll notice in the show every Clinton
