what has learned about her and how much she has\nLived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter] could blow this woman out of a water that's what I had nobody else has put

times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has them that that but\nThey've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to maybe wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there ... mocking ball the forty wasn't mocking or\nWhat I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is all they don't know what President that he did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is um investigated and put your but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there was no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate all last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now she's not so credible she never was but now it's not so credible all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed amount all Trump did is laid out the flaws\nStory which should have happened during the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't smart\nSpecially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says ... says they weren't that's only did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want he understands that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step and it it might look like it\nBut he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big take away from me as this one year the New York times and it's been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what\nIs not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat hey did you say no that's not the word\nWhat one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story year long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody and MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump but he got rich from his dad\n[noise] a bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to Saudi and said don't remember the\nClinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all at Johns\nEh you never know what you know when you got to go to ride a bike like what you're gonna come up I guess what you're gonna you're gonna come up with women like to have that\nGreat but it's not a Bill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience to know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester with confronted or a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall or any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill\nAnd they've been allowed to get into the hallways\nThe offices in Senate office buildings how does that happen\nWhat we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital caster they did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait\nA second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIt would destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestors\nHold on wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protests I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rape is goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not but then on the other hand\nReally you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I

to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the

doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\n\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nKristin balls the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what\nHe really thinks about anything and he may not do that\nOut of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing Trump\nWoman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far as to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill treat something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it\nThan will do the right to oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is\nA trumped developed\nI don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has established\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something if he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've grown out of the fact that he has ... continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how blindly insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night\nI Know Murkowski and Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors oh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not blocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just said we push she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me two were all women can join the can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRoche ... million women or nor do there should we do\nWell yeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women and they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision a movement of men\nIf you have such a group existed and Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun up in the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people that's one of the many reasons why she's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nFor our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party isn't so that is what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove you didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that\nBut he's also a mentor for a lot of guys because he has over

dot com studios\nBecause they're not really arguing about politics and all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years\nI have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this uh ... well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of\nAll of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThat capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go into girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate I'd say\nIt ... it in in many it's not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America of a target as America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the\nFord will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case can be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as a rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination and racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse\nBecause the Democrats don't fix anything and finally it doesn't even\nDepend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind seeing so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply resign did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine balls before\nAnd here it is that there's this they even they Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target up attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president for the other marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they both means or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be followed five to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have the ads to\nDo it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying she hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a great to have your back yet\nIt can be on again anyway so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them who are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like a couple of months ago saying that a guy he raped her because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nKind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine Ken and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time after him\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nUm [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow look at it from a better right by the way here's this ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include women\nWomen on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\n\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I'd look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let his nominee\nNeed be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on the lake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying\nWell you know this this may screwed it mccaskey and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentlemen I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in he big reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave\nAnd the Senate not a blue wave in North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo\nAfter having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened the ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing her challenger\nJosh Hawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell would win out\nOr that some Republican senators would win out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to look at words these three Heitkamp Donald Les McCann what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion and Heitkamp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and Murkowski when cave and that flake will continue to like in cave\n\nBut in their states there's held a pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed\nIn fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven polling has been gun\nHeading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\n\nBut if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them\n[noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line\nWrites that a reader of theirs\n\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with especially in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic it created a chart in essence\nBased on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it is the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sordid event Dr ... says happened\nAnd the dates float\nShe's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\nThe\nReader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July sixth of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrats California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt the charge here and try no tried served [noise] difficult\nTo convey but this is a text charge there is some ah some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\n\nIn the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties and hurt a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes are current as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\n\nHurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional\nOrnaments\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if everything she remembers changes that her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted\nWith both her therapist notes and the text message here is that presidents should order your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people about this to Eighteen today there is an emergency warning system test\nIt just happened to my watch started going crazy and I'm going to delete the test\nIs just a task it's not an Amber Alert it's just a test that if if global warming had been cited or or or um sea levels have risen and there would be this massive warning or alert from the president to tell everybody about\nIt [laughter] and it's actually not from the president's it's not Trump on the other end of your phone or\nYour device it's the federal government they're required to test this once every three years this is the first test of it\nAnd they tested during my show when they know a majority of Americans are going to be locked onto a device\nIt makes perfect sense I just delete it from my watch I should have taken a screen shot
