protect myself well there aren't a lot of security settings and smart speakers that's a problem I mean you put a pin on your Alexa or or you can just turn it off we're not using it but the researchers say that this is possible and they fully expect it to happen\nWithin the near future and speaking of attacks\nIt seems like anyone who I meet they always want to tell me how great a Tesla is\nThis

you're going to\nBe and he said yeah I'm just going to California and she said oh not a problem any charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\nWe're going to freeze the card everywhere else and he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably do me a favor she didn't said you know it just to make sure that everything's on the up and up or just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including

wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seemed ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply the same PIN number to your credit card\nBut I'm mailing out to you or can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have right now\nAnd he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the date earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account\nSo what this scammer head was every single thing about him except for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the car and they were able to
