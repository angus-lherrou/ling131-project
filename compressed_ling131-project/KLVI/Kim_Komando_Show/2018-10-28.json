think\nI don't know I said I Believe that I Do believe that um [noise] alright heres deal or there's really not a lot you can do because the six year old process or especially with today's video streaming and programs in games and everything else that they might be doing is still a six year old process or write\nA day and\nThe good news is there is any good news is that the next week a on the thirtieth of October I mentioned briefly during the news segment at the beginning of this hour\nIsn't it yeah is that apple is set to release a Mac will care for okay they say under a thousand dollars but you know the prices and you know yes exactly I think are a bit [noise] yeah I Know I hate when people do that it's like under a thousand dollars of thought to say yes it's\nNine hundred and Ninety nine dollars right a little tough and so you know and your other options that you look at refer a and\nSo if you go over to apple dot com and you have to actually ... to the bottom of the page Gregg and then there's an option and the second columnist says refurbished and clearance\nIs that you I think you might be able to start looking and you know you look this weekend but you know as more people are buying the newer stuff they're going to be trading and the older stuff right\nOr selling the older stuff whatever may be and so what I live with you by refer golfer apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was this Mac book released and then if the screen has to be replaced they do that it also still comes with a one year guaranteeing warranty\nAnd so you still have that but it's still gonna be you know you're still looking for you know twelve fourteen hundred bucks\nOh she living it let me ask you questions I talked to a guy at will the apple store here a little

calls answered I we're going back and forth\nIn some text messages this past week because I I sent you something that I thought was really truly funny and every once in a while you'll send me something funny and I'll send you something funny and I said what do you think about that this was a tweet that kind of sets the Internet on fire as her name is Alyssa Alyssa and I I don't want to miss quote her\n'cause there are some lakes in there that I don't want them to be missed adds context or maybe it's just the Generation Z in Maine\nBut how do people burn CDs like how do you get a blank CD and just put songs on it\nAnd the Internet went crazy like how did that ever where did the blank CDs come from first of all I'm very impressed that she tweeted the lake she didn't take it out she put like like how do you do this like so\nThat she is a a generation Z or which they were born from the mid nineties to them in two thousand Ninety seven is the start point who are pro is it what is it is a two thousand five two thousand seven then uh and tell where it ends is your thousands OK rise\nSo generate millennials or anyone in Ninety six set and the millennials were the ones that were responding to this thing in mind that old than a generation already has moved past\nAll of my technology when one person responded with a tree just saying I'm a billion years old and they were probably thirty\nShe now I'm not I'm all in you\nKnow Mr by year I was born in Nineteen eight I'm not one either [laughter]\nMaybe three but but he and my son is a gyms here right in K ... but he would know how to burn a CD because\nOf who is mom it yes and then dad as we've we've made CDs and he's been down in the studio and things like that but then\nIt may it got me thinking about other things that millennials and\nGuaranteed generations ears are not going to understand or ever use correct one of the first things that I think would be is is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now\nIs television commercials my son watches everything on you to write he doesn't know what cable television is it's all YouTube but then we hook up the ... and we're going to watch Sunday Night Football and it goes to commercial things like what's going on here so we just kept us can we've asked for this you know what that's a problem\nI mean I mean you 'cause you're you're absolutely right because in in you know where he\nHas never really had that the a commercial or if he does see a commercial that only Fifteen seconds yes and a half minute commercial there is a skipped\nRight once he watches five seconds of it All right I'm In fact when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like and I'm sitting there going\nHow do you fast forward and she's my father is but she does pay don't have that here you don't have a WPN and yet can skip the commercial I'm like oh my gosh how are they living what is going on\nBut see it with us it was just a convenience that's nice let's let's let's DVR something has kept the commercials but with the younger generation it's an given\nAnother thing I don't understand about my son is he'll say I want to watch a movie and you'll run and get his eye that we have a sixty five inch television and our living I'm not bragging it's huge he doesn't want to watch it he wants it in his lap and his hand on a small little I bet\nIt's so interesting to me and you know what though\nThat it is fascinating and and as he gets older you'll see different technologies and how they're using it\nVersus how you might use it and I want bigger I mean I'm a huge TV and I see those eighty five interests but they have a fries like trying from drew in over the now\nIn generation okay they're they're not really watching YouTube anymore they're done with you too yeah and how are they getting their entertainment that videos on Instagram Snapchat\nBut you're not going to find an illusion program\nThere are they you know what they he watch all those friends are watching some boxing match on YouTube okay so if it's an event\nThey'll go to YouTube yes but if it's you know no longer they sharing viral videos and I think we've talked about this for like each channel having its own app and so with my ... my my ... my inlaws have cable so they've given my son their passwords so he can look at the Disney Channel and

a yeah that ... thing you know Facebook is you can buy as well ah she's\nDone that in the past but it doesn't always drive up you know the ... like you would expect it to her\n... you know the other thing that she can do is that if you have a mailing list your youth you know where you're doing email marketing off of\nIs that you can tie that list into Facebook\nAnd so what that means is that because Facebook has everybody's email addresses that you can say you know here's my list of email address is find them on the site\nAnd then show them this ad for a discount coupon and then that

retailers are hopping into action Walmart is going to be trying to take you away from Amazon dot com is how they're going to do it [noise]\nThey offer free to day shipping for millions more items and they do right now ...\nAnd they say they're expanding it's free shipping offer for purchases thirty five dollars and above\nAnd you don't need to pay a membership fee to take advantage of it that's what Wal Mart kept saying because they want to remind you that Amazon Prime now costs a hundred and Nineteen dollars a year\nAnd Walmart says we're also making returns a lot simpler you can either print to return level from your online Walmart account or go to the nearest store\nJust pack up the item bring it to the Walmart services desk and they're going to return it for you right there on the spot you don't need to uh put it in the mail anymore they're going to start rolling this out in November\nAnd speaking of Wal Mart or a friend of mine doesn't so whenever he goes to Walmart when

few ... do you have to use your target credit card and it's only on orders over thirty five bucks case so everybody say they'll wait maybe this is something we can do to compete against Amazon Prime\nTarget says we have another idea they have the drive up the surface okay shoppers can place through orders on line\nAnd then you have to drive to target and then a target greeter is going to put your online order into your car\nAnd it's going to be available at a thousand stores I never understood why that is even an option white somebody at target thought that would be a great marketing idea when whatever you're gonna buy at target\nIs still to drive to target and then you have to find somebody to actually go get shorter and put it in the car versus just go into prime now that Amazon dot com and having it delivered that day\nIt seems to be able to grocery stores a local grocery store chain here in Phoenix, Arizona allows you to buy your groceries and go pick 'em up who they fight
