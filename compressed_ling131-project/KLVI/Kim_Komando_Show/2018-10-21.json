minding my own business but\nYou didn't I didn't\nHave an acquaintance too recently\nAh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a very when he was in the military and Europe okay ah and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born in ... and the people and his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on her and she would I could buy a no avail us failed miserably\nOh man so you're gonna wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years older so All right so she's Twenty years old\nAnd that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um you couldn't really\nSay anything about her like on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a a Facebook account that looked like it had origin each a January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social you know not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can\nTell your friend more about her or you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or what all\nAll of the above okay uh she does it for for money or they're not rich by any means ah ah the family just ... but a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nOh I'm sure I mean all of a sudden you have a kid coming out of the blue right and you're like okay\nI I'm just a bystander and all that well here are\nGood friend I mean you're worried about right and you want to make sure I was\nI was concerned in a rightly so ah\nI don't like she anybody get hurt a ... and and I heard you talk about the day before in a different stage but it can get a lot I used to ... dot com yeah the book goes all ah and I'm coming up with ...\n... you know there's also family tree now where okay\nYou might be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nUh and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer or a glass of wine okay because Germany click and other places are and then of course there's the surge which is another place for you to attract but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman is that\nYou know I'm surprised that that you know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media because that would be\nThe easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out\nThere I don't think he wants anybody ... oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know [noise] why do you have a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that that\nShe is his daughter and I don't she's got very good background and I think she's just out to get which you can do it\nAnd say well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find on line\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's gonna be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nA and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she ask for money so that this way you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember it or it sounds like he's probably not even going to tell you now that I think about that\nWell we're not that close like I should I'm just a bystander and all of this so there's a connection to uh [noise] uh other people uh that I'm associated with it and everybody is concerned for him a and it's taken a toll

I don't want to name a possible out a possible sponsor a future sponsors so I'll just say there's a place it is called bone marrow Brett\n[laughter] I was talking and code and they have their yesterday [laughter] amazingly\nDelicious food yes get the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had\nBooked every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of an era I developed the seven foot wall what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you but if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do that though if you're\nJust taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samsung Pay\nA lot of farmers market I bought spinach pasta whose twelve dollars for one thing of pasta\nThey asked they asked for a tip on the app\nThat you tip of course not okay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole and\nYou know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is for it and what I Love about the call is she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional she's on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen in in for somebody in her age to have this type of business that came in and it's something\nShe uses square and to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent\nOr twenty percent so I told her I said you know I said you got this all rock and she's like what do you mean and I said you\nKnow research has shown that whatever you put it in the middle that's what people are going to tip and\nThere'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call it which is the goal of all businesses are you'll have people out of more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so you know you're married you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old\nLittle pictures up there the kids you know and they you know and they're trying to get to they need new you know they're getting ready for college I don't know what I'm there cheekbones looking really hungry [laughter] whatever it may be\nI said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nFee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and\nSome people are gone like\nThirty percent but the ... isn't that different though because that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut it's the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great so when you're a bone marrow\nDo you tip yeah really I Do that's why they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay here's the reason\nWhy gay many many moons ago I\nWorked at ... which is a bar like Houston right and and when\nYou wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that I\nUnderstand but that's not their role at\nSo if you're at target\nWould you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the\nRegister no of course you want but ... but ... but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said\nIn and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThat ... percent point eight hundred dollars or something and they had to tip jars\nHow are you lived there were a basket there'll beach in California that's just south of half moon bay\nAnd is it is a beautiful there\nWell today the fog Israel and a little bit but it's really nice should be maybe in the low seventies um but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nAnd now let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband how just because we have to honor\nThat and they uh they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is helping the bus\nForty five foot\nAnd behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you guys over this way everybody has the picture and\nUm I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we are in our last month and a half here\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been RV\nWell great things I mean every day's an adventure in what we're doing um\nBut I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have ... you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator Airbus\nAnd if you're ... decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and the RV places are few and far between up there\nSo systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard or was that we have to take off the side when does it take off\nAnd have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change them I ... back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it off it was\nIt was it was an ordeal et cetera and bought a an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator\n[laughter] gosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] I [laughter] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to loosen up because how has a technical question that I bet you you will have input on so how give us a question\nOf basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early day adventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see if we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D. P. side which is a file transfer sight\nOf that we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and drag that twenty two gig video a back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital uh we decided to call the gym commando show\nOr write a lot of our listeners and a lot of our viewers you have your own small businesses and you're probably familiar with square is the way that she processed transactions and take payments\nWell there's a new one out it's called terminal from square and it's kind of a cool thing you should know about it now works with apple pay Google Pay Sam's on pay and also NFC process is payments over why five print that were seeds\nOr the square reader attachment also for the smartphones transaction right to point six percent plus ten cents the device itself costs four hundred bucks let me tell you if you take payments on the go it's hard to beat square\nIt's got all the angles ... covered at a square [noise] ankles covered [noise] to matter Andrew it took me a while you laugh at that one I took a while though\nOh I Love for more of the explanation as a joke on the actual joke\nWell 'cause nobody got it everybody's like has those at goldfish square angle he got it All right you're going to love this drone\nYou may not think about going to an apple store to buy a drawn but now the apple store they have a two thousand dollar drone for sale you're ready there's bad boys called this guy DO are one right the difference is that this guy DO basically finds itself\nOf course DJ I ... the other words you know you have to do manual controls and you've got to actually like know how to fly the thing\nThe sky idea it was like a robot or economists camera uses a series of sensors and it will dodge trees follow you around capture videos and photos now the drone can be also control by your apple watch which is the reason why the apple stores now have\nYou can't see alive preview of what the drones filming but you can control the flight haven't follow you pick out individual people for the drone to follow in film actually kind of cool so you can have a smart camera smart drone follow you around all day and take your photos and now you can really drone on about yourself about your narcissism\nNot laughing at that one [noise]\nOn come on that was really good but this is like the first products of all these tech smart products that I actually want the drone flying drones phenomena no it's actually really cool\nI mean that you can throw a drone up\nI mean it's only going to be in the air for twelve minutes I mean the batter doesn't left up to now product and so and then it will follow you around and take pictures but you know that's expensive uh two thousand dollar drunk but\nIt's really really cool imagine like if you got to my my kid's birthday party if it just followed my daughter around took pictures of the whole time at the well if it was you know really short\nParty has said she says she can't walk very far ahead 'cause she's not even one so it might work for her it was really cool it has its very\nBut two thousand I think that what you think the drones going to be a year from now\nA thousand dollars maybe even less I bet you us okay finally if you're trying to keep tabs on your caffeine intake\nThere's now these smart coffee cup that's right listen and you're going to know what it's all about amber has a couple of temperature control smart ... ever ceramic one they have a stainless steel plastic travel and the whole idea is with these smart bugs that you can choose your desire temperature and the bubble keep your coffee tea whatever\nAt a certain temperature for two hours okay\nBut here's the deal now the smart mug has an app yes with a companion up you didn't know that you needed an app to go along with your ...\nBut now this blue cheese link allows you to know your daily caffeine intake because the data's pass to the health app that will alerts you if you hit your recommended maximum daily caffeine levels because you're already this drinking\nToo much coffee can cause a lot of problems [noise] or that's all I got that's all I got remember the last story when I said that's really cool and that's a product I'd really want yes reversed for that for this\nOne you know a lot of people are worried about how does it come to know how much caffeine in a cup of coffee well because\nYou have to actually say on the app that this has coffee this she this is a Starbucks ...\nWhatever that is Fifteen dollar for up to ... Seventeen after two [laughter] yes exactly especially if you're an apple versus Android\nNone none none of the cubs to my house connect to the Internet so how much does this cup cost\nTwo hundred and Ninety nine dollars on a ... and ... and then of course there's a subscription now there is a monthly fee for my cup\nYou know I haven't I've given up on the smart water bottle\nI don't know if you've noticed I don't have it around me oh we definitely notice and gay I mean I was I had high hopes\nFor the smart water but how many weeks three weeks to the law I don't think it lasted that then you know what if you want to take the over under on anything that should've been it especially 'cause you wouldn't stop talking I mean you have like to have a lot of conversation about it was really cool\nI mean you know that this thing would blink whenever I needed to drink water\nAnd then it would keep track of that yeah they can't keep track of it when I'm sitting in your closet and it doesn't really work okay I mean I Wish it were that doesn't really work but\nIt was a hundred and Ninety dollars for a coffee I don't know I made that up it's probably not too and it's probably Ninety dollars All right here's a hundred and fifty okay close it's still outrageous stupid\nBut you know what somebody's going to buy like somebody's gonna buy that two hundred and twenty nine thousand dollar diamond emerald encrusted I ... apple watch for\nKind of a drinking coffee no sorry I only have one bar a cat\nRight now [laughter] ...

there's the ex are going to say the ex are really\nSomebody well here's the deal it has an edge to have screens facial id and has a larger Bezos around the screen um here's the bigger than the access or the even the access Mac six point two by three inches\nIs versus five point seven by three inches\nA but the big differences the building material the excesses on steel and glass the ex are they cut down the cash the money that you need to spend on because of the lumina but it does come and fix scholars have you on that black white red yellow coral and blue\nAnd it actually has a smaller screen even though it has a bigger footprint or hand print I guess you'd say so it's worth the money well start at seven fifty ramps up to twelve hundred if you don't have the\nCash for the access I guess it as the screen is not as good um it's a lower entry point to getting an iPhone so if that's what you can afford that's probably the best bad for you or buy a used iPhone ten which maybe even a better choice\nAnd before I go back to your phone calls and also our money tip about great gadgets that are worth the money it's a Halloween right just a couple of weeks away might be saying how do I kind of get my house all decked out probably in the smart way the tech way well a couple of systems you might want to check out one called the silver a new smart plus range\nAs some bulbs Eli de floods spotlights flexible\nLighting strips outdoor garden life and you see the here's the thing is that they come with their own apps that you can program all this and also works with Amazon relaxing the Google Assistant and also apples home kit\nThere's also the smart puts garden spot many don't worry about writing this down we have some more information over a commander dot com but then you're going to need to think I'm all up and then you're going to need to add some spooky sounds and so that's where he labs\nIt has Halloween living scenes and she will Halloween which is an avid Hugh haunted house those are some\nUh lighting and music ... so there are ways that you can still step up to a game and get that house ready for Halloween with all those lights and sounds and back to the phones we go with Charlie and a great bend Kansas Charlie\nKill great to talk to you thanks so much for your call today so it was going on\nI mean we've got a um a small theater group so what do you put on three employees are year than I than an old movie theatre here in ... and\nNow how cool is that\nIt's also a ... to ... we just sort of a good on the on the phone call and there's a we get our keys to the church to call them tractors to all these people and we get a law or the people so we got from the cage floating\nAll [laughter] running all over the county everybody's got to care [laughter]\nEverybody's got to go to this place when we were having a hard time controlling it so our idea is to one of the doors and you'd like to put like a digital type law\nSure that we can program with coats and give the hotel now is the truth a lot to be able to set the stage to automatically explode or twenty four dollars or ... or ... or whatever is needed for that and the second to this\nLittle light or a little guilty to a program like the on site but it was ...\nAll such such nobody will stop it all the time\nRight well you don't live ... you know the good news is is that the technology exists\nThe even better news Charlie is that it's super simple to use okay awesome and so when you buy the smart lock is that a couple of ways you can do it uh I actually have on a a ... house that I Am\nIs that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay and so\nWhen somebody books through ... I can go and I can put their name in and I can say\nThis law is going to work on this I on Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre okay\nAnd you put the person's name in there and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise]\nUm and you can program this remotely program is right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the leg lock if not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nIs that you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things hub or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lights for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charles what I'm saying is that once you get the hub you start thinking about OK", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "21"}
