going on um well a little confused\nUm we're traveling to Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\n... an app so and I'm using ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry either [laughter] there's good his fat different is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basic okay is that when you're on the public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com has whatever may be\nIs that anybody can just pluck that out of the year so and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that is going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us is traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out okay\nAnd so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where are you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany oh how fun yeah can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this was like the coolest thing you're going to totally love Esteban when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pick who daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and it's augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nThere's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the museum which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right question songs and you know if you could do a food toward any of this that it's been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's nowhere to BPA\nAnd then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use and it is free or like for example when I was in London last month\nAnd so it does slow things down a but\nIf you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go to your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile\nPassport beard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else and get them out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back there's four hundred and fifty people

show or Andrew and I discuss various topics of high intellect in\nValue and I prefer to that by saying Andrew wants to talk about well Andrew wants to talk about I did I say Hi intellect and value did okay um he wants to talk about Kanye West\nYes but it's more of the tax side of the Kanye West we're we're not getting into politics\nNot at all at all love I'm Adam whatever who cares but the Internet was reacting to Conyers phone\nFirst of all we learn Kanye West uses a cell phone because he took out that phone and it's an iPhone and the unlocked it to show the price of the United states gifts okay when he ... that he was on camera\nSo everybody got his pass code correct okay can you guess what is ... let me give you a hint very\nSimilar to yours well you know I have I saw a badge them alert to you okay I saw that headline that the pass code was\nZero zero zero zero zero zero correct six zero which you know that used to be\n[laughter] until ... when did you change it this morning or do you draw the line [laughter] and\nIt's it's a lot more difficult for you to break into one one one one one closed seven ... seven seven seven seven far from zero to write much harder the other thing that the Internet was criticizing Kanye West for tech wise\nWas that he had his phone in a case yeah I Want the big deal about that it's not cool\nIt's no longer cool down your smartphone in a case so who's saying that is\nIt's not a cooler these people that are put her emotional and kids that are being because those of us that have to shell out ... you know a hundred thousand Fifteen hundred bucks on a phone I don't want it to shatter if I drop and\nThe criticism is is that you can get tempered glass on the front and you no longer need the case on the back unless you have a mold for you that's going to charge you had there's no reason to have a case\nWell that's what the Internet was attacked and get other stupid okay here's the other reason why you need a case they've corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right very pretty good mine's pink mine's black okay but the reason why it's pink is so that when I throw it into my black per\nSe I can find\nSo that's why if you got one like me I have a rose gold iPhone it'd be easy to find in my purse\nFew I guy with a rose gold phone and the only I for some and blows bad I brought a case on it anyway what does it\nMatter so we were talking about Conyers password yes zero zero zero zero zero zero there was a call for everyone to try and hack his social media accounts so they wanted to use\nEmail addresses and logging and then just tried to pass weren't password one two three because odds are that's what his past where it is so then came out the stories about horrible pass for us to have and I learned something which surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter] I've never heard about password walking\nYou never heard a password walking never that's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter in your past where\nMost popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are good at the top row and the bottom row and you walk\nWith your fingers across ... and then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose they'll go down three right back to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V.\nTo W. S. X. cause has been pushed to row and let me tell you something if you were just look at that as a password he'd be like that's a darn good pass for exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary got word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know or some some a haiku\nYou know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords oh I'm so don't I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset like what was your or second grade teacher his middle name\nUh\n[laughter] well that's the way to to step verification is so great especially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football\nAnd ... and only use it for famous football every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password 'cause it's been six months and they used it but if I have an a Yahoo apple on my phone they send me a message through the ... and I can get in\nYeah and that's really the off yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we look at people who can plan to go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not trying to set up security\nAre going to tell you something now my space in Lincoln yes they bowls since two thousand and sixteen if I have huge security breach\nOr you know in their ... can you guess in the category of brands one or two of the most popular passwords that were used in the mornings and\nThis is really a tough one I don't know these two stories are connected I think they might be and I buy the blonde hair\n[laughter] my space and linked him yeah just use it as their password but when that Mustang that's probably the these are brands are so Mustang Ferrari people like to use car names as their passwords playboy\nSpeak to a a video editors actually thriving in the gig economy\nOr then our next command on demand that we put out this week is about the deceptive technologies that are being used to fool your senses and why businesses and celebrities

Illinois hello there Thomas\nHello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that function something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYeah that's part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go visit their an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer the shit here's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday perfect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in text it ended up being thirty five pages long about fifty to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now there it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available or icy\nIf you're looking for a particular app you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo ... did you not yes we used to fly you shutter flies at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book do yes and we got it and 'cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word I called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular ...\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay uh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form about those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they re communicated back and forth on fiber they ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task putting in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and\nOr drop me a note through the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know\nThat you send me through the website and I've

sir\nI got a three part question right here I'm In Boston it's okay to ... all along reputation management I guess my first let them be like well with me the best oh yeah that I can find for small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it those old or a I'm a software that you ... and then the the field that search engine optimization ethical would all fall out\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\nWell the problem now than what some of it is obviously what most of us have is you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bad reviews balance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know are the people have experience it's usually doesn't go online and put post there the\nPositive experiences with you at your business [noise] so what am I here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do it by something someone to neutralize the negative responses that's happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type\nManagement farm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody to do the job when you've already done the job right\n[noise] right and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for all the\nMedical it's like ... grade the current okay all lady they use excel\nOkay so okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nPhil anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you\nKnow if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you say you know can you help on line and\nJust dropped somebody up there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can\nGet let me finish the other thing you can\nDo is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they\nWill spotlight your business\nYou'll have more tools available to you\nYou'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore so\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to\nAccentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "14"}
