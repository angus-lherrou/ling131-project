they have those in t._v. guys anymore\nI Know who won the TV I don't really like\nMy wife used to sell TV guides when she was a kid\nOh yeah everybody at TV I everybody at Reader's Digest oh yeah I mean that was just\nCommonplace but anyway oh of course let's go out and talking about Michael First or would like to hear that that's going to be the big story nationally certainly a lot about a hundred miles now from Panama City so it's not always an already feeling some impact they're already getting a tropical storm force winds impacting the coast\nWith a hundred and forty miles per hour and that's actually a Airforce one just went through just while ago I used to getting a little bit stronger so we could go a little bit higher before deputy south but uh\nIt's it's really up you'll be a bad situation the question is will it in a populated areas those beach resorts hair and Panama City\nAll all the time does everything there it can be really close so late this case scenarios for the past just a little bit east there and keep them on the western side of the hurricane what should be rich or shot but\nIt's got to be a big problem there in Tallahassee also got to get hammered because they're going to be definitely on the east side of the hurricane passed or the west are coming up to not so big problems in Florida\nAnd will make landfall probably around two three o'clock hour time it'll be up later on states only about a lot of seven eight hours away nine hours away from landfall a parole so we're looking at a cool guy already seeing a little bit that this morning I have sixty eight degrees upper sixties lakes to\nNo fear banned the showers and Conrad luck getting that represents the actual front which will be moving through as we work through the day so a good looking forecast because we're west of the hurricane was normally when\nSo thirty percent of the showers this morning\nBut after this morning no rain at all for tonight route Sunday or how long has it been going stretch like that and uh it's about time and now that certainly is going to be good we can forecast to lots of blows in the mid to upper fifties or many locations tonight tomorrow I only in the upper seventies you're a good good stuff\nIn our forecasts and let's take a look at the highs and lows McAllen, Texas again dominate thanks Ninety seven degrees\nAnd the low temperature now I've never heard of this place even though I've been in this area for work I thought the Aspen Springs Colorado naturally thank us around asked but mhm you wouldn't be wrong if you thought\nOh OK down around put goes to spring you know work but goes to springs is\nWhat I can you know a lot that's where a little beaver and red Ryder air from\nExactly there you go that's right yeah you don't want everybody talks about the red Ryder a you know a gun that you'll shoot your eye out with but nobody remembers that red Ryder was you know a famous famous cowboy him a little beaver there were a comic strip as well as a movie\nRight right and uh I Know some of the true grit was actually shot\nJust west of aerial John Wayne I'm back in the day in a shot that shot some of the a video of the background there around those uh spring it like I've been there several times Rogalski up there on the mountains of but not not run Aspen stuff\n\nAway from seven o'clock news talk radio Kelly I\nAbby Finkenauer campaign ad a\n... vote on the horn and soybean farmers\nA candidate explains just want to sell their crops and make a living ... should be fair but they shouldn't make things harder um this is the uh this is the situation where Trump's tariffs are sparking battles once again a but there he's going for more ethanol based gas\nOr which is going to make the oil companies mad\nBut it's going to make the corn belt people happy and and this happens anytime a anytime you change anything nobody likes to change anything my famous stories that when I first came to kill the act a Paul Harvey news was on at seven thirty\nEvery morning and so up ... the station he says look I Want I Want to carry that that she is in a seven thirty news so let's just take Paul Harvey ... to seven forty five I said\nYou really want to do that is well you know we at the time or the NBC network and we had Howard Cosell sports at seven twenty seven which went right into T as a news if you'd let it\nSo we changed it to Paul Harvey news and of course uh the overwhelming cry from the audience was on blade people screaming people calling up telling us they'd never listen each other again they blow us up and and finally I answered the phone one morning and little old lady was there and I said yes ma'am\nShe's sweat Paul Harvey why did you change it and I said I ... you work she's I don't work a housewife I says well then you know it doesn't make any difference if\nPaul Harvey is on at seven thirty or seven forty five you're at the house she's just seven forty five is one I put my washing\nThe drier and that was it because we're all creatures of habit since nobody likes nobody likes them anything change\nBut anyway there is change and it's a brewing and uh there's going to be a change I\nI Do not think even the Trump will take ah the ah oh she's already said that he was a total and he was he's not going to do that now it's as he is starting\nTo mature more as a president he's holding his tongue somewhat I he didn't say a whole lot about the Kavanaugh situation\nRarely blasts through that rally well actually what but Russia made it very very good point all he said was yet how why why and where that is all he did eight in ...\nHe still discriminate Russia I think it would have been better off saying nothing\nWell maybe so and maybe not I I think that to his base which was IDs base here very he's concerned with you know screw the other side because you're not going to get that anyway they hate you they're going to burn up your pickup truck if you've got a Trump stick around the back like the guy in Washington\nSo you know you play to your base well and that's why the way they play to our base that\nIs what makes him popular in that he does play to the base and he doesn't try to add to it yeah I mean he definitely plays to his base\nKnow they they used to try to I remember when they are consultants or used to come here and some of the things that they said were really really good\nAnd some they'd say you know to acquire new listeners\nYou need to do this and I remember telling the guy said that if we if we go after those new listeners are going to lose some of the ones that we've got here and that's what we don't want to do you play to your base and and and in the hopes that maybe you'll catch on like a honey and well unless you get more\nUnless you can get more listeners in in that I think is sort of Trump's issue is can you expand out a for instance can there be a a can there be a red wave this fall candy you expand\nThe only only but only with the Republicans did vote for that stayed home and didn't vote\nRight yeah so that you gotta get moderate Kenny when those folks over in expanding\nDavid Lee Roth is a sixty four today Tanya Tucker is sixty rat pharmacy
