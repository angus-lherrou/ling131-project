government is spending way too much money and because you much for the president's corporate tax cuts taking in a lot less in revenue federal budget deficit sky rocketed last year to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars and Uncle Sam had to borrow even more money\nIn an effort to lower drug prices drug makers will soon be required to disclose just how much they're charging for all those drugs they advertise on TV\nThe ads will not list the actual prices but will show a website that will liquidation sales could begin shortly at some of the one hundred forty two years and k-mart stores that will be closing down before the holidays the retailer file for bankruptcy yesterday\nAnd industry magazine says Burger King has the fastest fastest food at least at the drive through customers got their food in three minutes three seconds on average McDonald's four and a half minutes\nA new report says global warming could cause the price of beer to double because of the impact on barley and thirty one million Americans are expected to buy a Halloween costume this year for their pets\nAnd the price of beer has now been tied to global or global warming\nWell this may not come as much of a surprise to a lot of people I mean already we've heard the global warming will make chocolate wine coffee and some other things cost more so why not be here the problem according to this journal called nature plants is that\nBarley a key ingredient in beers particularly sensitive to the increasing bouts of extreme heat and severe drought\nThat global warming causes and researchers say the loss of water could cause barley yields to be as much as Seventeen percent lower this year that could make beer prices double and other places like Ireland where beer is already expensive triple\nDoes any good news in this report it that there's no indication that hops aren't any danger All right\nSandy ... okay I'm I'm feeling better about that uh five fifty two at a new drug five sixty a tale vi\nA barrier to budget deficit is at the highest level in six years we managed to run that up the higher than ... you know every president gets elected saying they're going to do something about the deficit\nOr what was it Bush was going to do something about it a Obama was going to do something about Trump's going to do something about it it just keeps getting higher Treasury Department reports the deficit for the two thousand Eighteen\nFiscal year that ended September thirtieth not as much we're in the whole this would be how much you're in the red and the check book hitting a new all\nTime record in two thousand Eighteen seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that's higher than any year since two thousand and uh well so [noise]\nNot good news of course the only way you solve that is you stop spending and if you stop spending somebody doesn't get their hand out in the they're not happy or you don't have the military of is not prepared or whatever so yeah you just keep keep spending and keeping it can you just want the interest is\nOf seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars like our economy sometimes I just wonder what sort of show game like a shell game sometimes

the project better for all nine Seventy seven twenty nine twenty nine\n\nMy turn I was just reading this is interesting uh you probably already heard but the judge has caused the Stormy Daniels defamation\nSuit against a President Trump toss it out\n[noise] toast on yesterday there will judge ultra ordering the porn star to pay the president's legal fees to go to court records which I don't think it's a bad thing in in some of these cases when you get frivolous lawsuits\nAh I think it's it's a encourages fewer frivolous lawsuits if the judge turns around and says okay you pay\nThe case stems from a Trump tweet they'd call Daniels who claimed to have had an affair with him a total con job Trump has denied the affair the judge us district judge in Los Angeles said Monday the comments made in the president's tweet\nAppear to be an opinion protected by the first amendment ... so this is not I guess the entire case and she has a mother\nA cases against the president but this was a\nThis was in response to his tweet that she was a total con job\nAnd there are questions about First Amendment rights when you tweet\nOr what would you say something of that nature the we didn't question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United states the ruling reads the first amendment protects this type of rhetorical state but\nThe president's attorney ... victory or the amount Daniels needs to pay will be decided at a later date a no amount of spin or commentary about Stormy Daniels or lawyer can truthfully characterized today's ruling in in any other way than a total victory for the president his attorney says uh\nDaniels' lawyer or do they always say when they lose says he plans to appeal a Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford which everybody should know by now a claim she was approach in two thousand eleven by man who threatened her to keep quiet about the alleged affair with Trump\nUm they've released a schedule is supposed suspect the next day the president tweeted a sketch about a nonexistent man a toll on job\nPlaying the fake news media for fools but they know that\nBy the way she's thirty nine which I gather is probably pretty old for porn stars most porn stars I gather get in that business when they're you know in their um teams of legal age and twenties inside so the one thing you can say about this whole episode\nIs it's probably the publicity is probably ... started her career to be honest she's probably profited at thirty nine now we're talking about her and I guess nobody was talking about her before\nShe claimed she received death threats had to hire bodyguards and the ... century eccentric cetera a ruling by the way and this is what I thought the ruling does not affect Daniel ... primary case against Trump\nAnd his former lawyer Michael Cohen seeking to invalidate her two thousand sixteen nondisclosure agreement so it doesn't affect the main lawsuit basically a federal judge has said isn't truthfully no surprise that are\nThere yeah people say things they can tweak things and that's part of the political process and calling in a con job\nDoes not mean that she gets to sue him and quit coming to the court was silly stuff like this and I'll teach you a lesson because I'm going to make you pay his lawyer too so that's a that's the sum total of
