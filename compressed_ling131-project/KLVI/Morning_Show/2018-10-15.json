you know being number one as opposed to a number of eleven well number one is okay yes that's as far as I'll go with the numbers this morning gotcha thank you very very much meanwhile\nThe folks who did not listed during the storm\n\nTerry more tells what they do in the aftermath of Michael another deadly hurricane long said he doesn't understand why some people do not he devaluation orders\nIt's frustrating to us because we repeat the cycle over and over again\nDuring a D.C briefing long noted that storm surges are often far more destructive than the wind and rain from hurricanes\nWhile we cry for preparedness you know we want people to understand how the storms attack communities you know they're classified by wins but storm surge causes the most of my loss of life and it causes the most amount of destruction you know or that the country well forget it\nAnd those communities make plans to rebuild long made a plea for better building codes\nAre when you go back to rebuild these areas that you do so in a resilient fashion and we don't rebuild to the same standards that we have locals in state government start to implement real building codes across this country and unfortunately in this country we sing and not learn the lesson\nWell and we do not learn the lesson about the evacuation either and and that is so sad uh people just wanting to be macho or just that do not understand the gravity of the situation\nWell and I think there's two things that work there in number one young people do need to understand the dangers of staying also I think that ah the media and weather services everything can't be the worst storm ever now the case of his most recent storm you'd really really was\nBut so many times we always hear it's going to be horrible you'd only cry wolf so many times about to a certain extent the meteorologist in in the weather service they they can't really tell you how hard it's going to be\nBut I think people are just uh sometimes say yeah this is what you said last if he's like elections every election you notice is the most important election of your life [laughter] okay what is the last one it or is this what is\nThe first one as this one so must\nYou must leave now really a ... I think that's part of it and part of it you you you nailed it as a gal is macho feeling and the and a and and also then you have the issue is when you leave a maybe not letting your back in which then makes a lot of people don't want to leave just get back in the truck their property\nWorse Taft Texas oh you got me that's that's one on me Taft taxes uh apparently for men shot and killed at a child's birthday in Texas who do you see\nThe video on that very tragic yeah\nForming killed another one did\nAt a child's first birthday party what the hell is wrong with people you go to a kids' first birthday party I remember both my well all three of my grandchildren and their first birthday it was happy my ex wife was there\nYeah I I thought we'd joke back and forth I mean everybody's foreman killed at kids first birthday party when he gets\nTo be twelve or Thirteen\nThey'll say what was my first birthday party like well for men were killed at it\nThat is is very unbelievable twenty year old man taken into custody father also suspect hasn't yet better rested those killed sixty two year old man and three men in their twenties who were his grand sons\nObviously and not a family was argument at the back yard party in the town of Taft which involved distant relatives\nAnd I I don't like him you know I don't like them either I Know here we're having a party there you go wow unbelievable I'm\nSears declaring bankruptcy and no big surprise\nSurprise that takes the question's going to be Ken any of them survive and of course more immediately for us having a Sears located in our area can the seniors in our area survive 'cause that's local job yep\n[noise] they haven't earned a profit in eight years assets of one billion dollars from eleven billion dollars in liabilities of ... million\nFrom fifty billion from fifty billion to ten million\nAnd you know they they are not advertisers so I don't know a lot about ... local Sears stores 'cause that maybe what their problems too but I Do we have more than one a birthday present or civil one in Port author and what an orange I don't know I don't either\n... birthdays anniversaries let's get to the first time I ever shopped at ...
