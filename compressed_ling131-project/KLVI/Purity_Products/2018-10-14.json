John welcome back to Texas outdoor news how you doing this morning\nI ever again guys thanks for having me\nAbsolutely absolutely but hey listen you know you Everytime I look at the ecosystems of Texas and I think about your district um is rather unique in rather instead of being square rectangular kind of runs off at an angles uh got almost like a\nGerrymandering in in the congressional district in it\nYou know I don't know I run the northeast up near the red river all the way down toward a Bryan College station kind of cut through a good portion of the Lone Star state I'm coming out of last hunting season good weather play a role in uh in in the hunting season that we're entering\nYeah I think it is in general terms you know we had a\nHair uh east Texas you know in my sweat are so I don't think whether it was a problem you know as the as we went into late winter early spring you know plenty of moisture so we thought were going to have a you know really wet year uh within you know as we move towards summer you know quit or for much of the district\nWith the exception of north of eyes thirty which seem to catch every ranks our all summer long so there are nice and less up in the northern part of the district\nYou know and then when you go south by thirty or even more you know south south Tony all away to College Station and this kind of depends on you know one of the cloud stops and what you got any rain we're still much of the district\nYou know several inches behind a ... but uh uh\nOn their side of the coin or their side of the fence and other people that are head of the average too so I just got to kind of depends on where you're at\nThe overall what what do you look at your their population in your in your district\nOh you know continue to increase based on you know our survey information not dramatic increases but just over the past many years is a steady\nIncrease in and their numbers you know are in spite of also increasing pressure so low that in itself to me would be an indication that the overall ... pretty healthy\nLooking at a recent weather events as we started into fall and then of course we've got\nA supposedly for cash them or whether I'm full range um would you say that we're looking at a good match crop are we looking at fault for jobs that are sprouting now ... what kinda what kinda forge is natural forge is on the ground for dear\nSo my predicts on you know the corn crop you know is is good two very good you know again depending on\nYou know where you're at what those time showers and stuff that I Walk under some host oaks that you know very view that corn and then you'll go just ... trees and they're just you know loaded so uh you know\nI think it makes me laugh sometimes it hunter's kind of get disappointed when called cross good because you know the court Peters not as good or dependable so [noise] uh these we've had some really time the rains here lately so for production by so green up there's going to be good as we're here in the early parts of the\nArchery season and ... so I I think were set up pretty good habitat conditions what\nWell and I am to John I think it's time for you to get up on your legs like a man and get out there and get amongst them uh and you know do a little do a little still hunting or with that mass crop though are now what's the status of one of my favorite big game animals squirrels\n[laughter] squirrels and the big game animals that missed like why are they are in a mate smaller rival make some bigger you know you go yeah\nSo a squirrel certainly a underutilized you know many of our or especially our public areas here in in the district you know we get more school hunting pressure from non residents to\nToday you know this morning when I got up you know is in the fifties and and the guy should really consider going out and sitting in the woods do a little school so they're apple opportunity we had you know good mass production the last couple of years so that equates to or city quite to war squirrels so the opportunity should be quiet for\nA you know I Know you are as a a long time waterfowl hunter and we when we put the report together for the October ...\nIn Texas outdoors journal so lower legs and ... areas were down um but um that was boating well for what a production of of CD type hum\nA grant says or or like a duck duck weed and stuff like that there are things shaping up now we're catching the water to a flood some back areas\nThat you know some of my local lake or I Do most of my copy fish and stuff is still a couple of the low not necessarily a gray water fell like but uh as you go up on that I went to court or again you know the the those lakes have filled up or have put some water in those Warsaw plan for\nThe last part of the early ... season or the guy's a visit with were reporting a very nice numbers the ducks and an excellent habitat condition\nMany of the stock tanks which are certainly sleepers in the dark world across Texas 'cause most people don't pay that much attention to that\nOr you know surveys and everything in the case you know significant warfare I used to cross the state on stock on them so they shouldn't be and and much better condition than they have been so [noise] you know we get some\nYou know miserable weather for our friends at north we ought to have you know a nice ...\nYou know John looking at a program has been going on for a guy I guess decades or in your area or the or the turkey restocking what are we looking at as far as our turkey is now\nWell it's getting a little better now as we weren't we all have a real obvious\nSuccess or they two years ago [noise] ... some real brands and some ... uh\nYou know we don't expect much from those first your stocking but we got documented production and same birds and getting more trick reports so I Am cautiously optimistic that not going to say where you know turn the corner but ah we're gaining momentum and uh\nAs far as just general hunting success for the spring season you know it was it was slightly better than the last couple of years the average ... little bit lower than the long term average you know the guys\nYou know still was shooting all you know a few hundred eastern Turkey's a year or in this part of the state but ah as far as the restoration efforts are like I said I'm very cautiously optimistic and we had some really good success last year or so\nOn some of the wildlife management go opposite Joan or working in managing specifically for ground nesting birds for turkey um what I have learned is that benefits all while alive but it takes a pretty good chunk of ground neighbors really need to talk to each other a minimum acreage is what ten thousand\nYeah we'll wait do a an eastern talking eastern turkey stalking restoration effort yeah when we want to put together ten thousand or so that takes in this part of the world you know\nSome good neighbors or some cooperation\nOverall you know a larger landscape but uh [noise]\nWe continue to get interest from a land owners are hotter than and", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city":
