when the deer started growing handlers\nBack ah say march April the timeframe\nOr how how are things shaping up in your district\nWhere water early on um we had really timely rains and browse habitat was only really good shape or wasn't till we hit you know late in the summer that we really started to dry out\nWell you know they say Texas weather if you don't like it wait a minute has the worm

tiny which turned out a little drier and even got into some of the severe drought indexes environments but but closer down in an academic just a ... we never quite got into that extreme drought that they did further north but overall I still think we're in good shape I think that the browse held out fine and then you know we've got some timely rains uh\nTowards the end of August and September of course and things really shifted I think the mascot turned out fine and certainly the or the browsers fun as well\nYou know with all the different creeks and the repair in areas that we've got in your district\nUm that that has to be some really thick country and that's where some monster a monster white pills um you know are are are hiding out when we have ... like this and water comes up a little bit is there a certain displacement that that moves critters into other areas that may present an opportunity for hunters\nYeah it takes quite a bit of water to really push them out of those bottom

success from this\nUm I have heard and I need you to confirmed that a bad management strategy or if it works for ground nesting birds that works for white tail it works for a pretty broad range of a critters is that right\nWell thanks so you know it's a\nIn a case of a ground nesting large I think that there's a threshold back in the old days they worked and block stalking [noise] uh you know
