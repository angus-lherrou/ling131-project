guides biologist for South Texas Pleasanton David coast David welcome to Texas outdoor news or how you doing this morning\nAmerica how 'bout yourself doing well doing interviews David or Daniel I'm Sorry I said David I'm Daniel is Daniel ... ahah yeah so\nI don't know that again this gets to stay in this era let me ask you this ah one of my usual brittian questions but technical guidance biologist what is your job\nBasically we can assistant landowners on a ... cat management and managing a lot of times there again species but we do a lot of other things as well but that's a big portion of our job\nYou know coming out of last hunting season we were on the heels of Hurricane Harvey um gets on your survey did you see much of a um decline in hunter participation and and the decline and I'm harvest because of hunters are taking care of their primary homes\nOr early but it really impacted the season especially they they get back down here later in the seats and they still came down to hot after they got everything in their personal lives squared away get so they didn't get some artist on that but yes in fact the harvest straight somewhat\n... worth of weather that we have because it wasn't widespread in South Texas um what kind of a start\nYeah I'm On it we're growing seasons in the spring what kind of conditions that we have\nWhere most of south Texas a head ... rain fall or at least decent rainfall in January to set us up for the spring and then the spring was dry okay and so uh it was pretty spotty or most of south Texas in the spring\nUh it got worse and and the western portion of south Texas throughout the summer they weren't extreme drought if he drew a line probably from highly nine down highly sixteen a step west of that was was pretty dry the spring and summer\nEntity to that in the summertime we kinda got some rains in June and so the eastern portion hurt a little bit better as far as available moisture in the summertime [noise] but uh most of south Texas in spring it was pretty spotty rainfall did not have as a stellar spring\nYeah Daniel I'm ... and this is the age old question okay 'cause I've got a place up in the hill country and I've certainly I I and I have hunted down in South Texas but I go okay hill country let me see and I got I got oaks and I got the ... and I got grass and all this stuff and I go down to south Texas and I go [noise]\nHow do they get bigger 'cause I don't know what they eat you know if you look at the heck is it hard here are hardy or because of that or what\nThe answer the one good thing about south Texas is a are available brush not\nGenerally airport for Forbes whenever they can get um south Texas is a semi arid environment which means forms are highly dependent on rain fall we don't always get the rain down here\nBut we did have a lot of brush and so a lot of the available brush has very good nutrition and also a you know it it's good habitat down here not just nutrition but recovered space and everything else as well so we did have a lot of diverse brush a face and that really\nHelps that but here population out especially when it gets dry when it gets dry ship purport to browse and that helps carry them through a drought uh in addition we have a lot of ... which creates a lot of beans during a drought and that can really curious to what you're out as well and and again this year really helped us out being crop\nWith a range of late then we had we had\nAn onset of um ... of all forms of that have been coming up\nOh yes sir all of south Texas looking great right now\nI'm a Forbes grass a viable her ... cover ... it's an excellent shape so uh what is going to happen it's just going to make life difficult for hunters because we're not going to count that corner very well you're not no record Peter\nBut and the IRS terms and also quail in Turkey and in every other games the the habitat is in great shape\nOr what I saw um a a report on ... that I'm a Robert Perot's was saying that uh some of these birds are maybe trying to pull off of lake hatchery all getting any uh like reports on them\nYes sir Yes sir I Am a and again mainly I Would say to the age of sixteen on the eastern side of south Texas I'm Still hearing reports of a little bumble bee is a little baby quail are being born it's late\nAh now there's slight they're not going to have a a production ear are generally that happens from you know we get rain April June that's their highest productivity time but they're still going to try and work seven to produce ... at least on the eastern side of this uh of of the south Texas\nHere we usually um a lotta people wait on Quil hunting until after ... and so by the time ... late January in in in the month of February to the end of the clothes a coil season though those birds ought to be up to humble size but also don't ... hunters don't need to put the pressure when we've not had a good I'm good hatch right\nYes her in and Quil hunter's kind of self regulate it there's not a lot of quail out there that generally don't how much or late they take a lot fewer birds\nHere let me go back maybe\nNot a problem on over harvesting a quail or you know they can over our past that if a few people ate at heart but state wide it's generally not a problem\nHere before we run out of time going to go back to 'em round June when the phones are being dropped what kind of on a recruitment and survival did we see is you were saying we were kind of Brian that summer period\nYes or a on the western side of south Texas or it was\nIt was better than I expected a given the rank all we had it's still going to be a ... to an average ... crop\nUh and then on the eastern side I Would say it's about average no doubt so not not too terribly bad considering the dry conditions are the one difference we add anything to get nearly as hot as previous droughts we had so I think the fall it's fair to a little bit better\nGot you one of the ... we got in South Texas a about turkey what kind of hedge do we see a have a decent pulled recruitment\nA turkey production was I Would say corn this year across south Texas or however we were going to have a lot of Turkey's the hot because we've had several previous years of get production so there's a lot of adult bird out there so I Would encourage everybody to get out there in in hot and they share production it just was not that good", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "28"}
