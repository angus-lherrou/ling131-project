segments\nDo we do this time of year with all eight or ... district leaders really enjoy working with these gentlemen over the years and um some of them are getting getting a few years like I Am on me and one of 'em is uh my buddy Kevin ... from brown with Kevin how you doing today\nI'm doing well bill is always good to talk to you\nAbsolutely hey listen you know when we talked about a month ago for the forecast that appears in the October issue of Texas outdoors journal I'm obviously we all we start talking about rain coming out last hunting season and conditions and um\nYou know in talking to you really get an idea of how big ... and how big your district is because there is um some drought condition setting in and and you made a comment that there were parts of your district\nThat had conditions that folks were reporting we're I'm worse in twenty eleven that that that's kinda scary\nYeah it it uh it didn't last long but\nI think that different or was it we had many more days of a\nMuch higher temperatures and so you know you get you get the wind and you get a hundred and Fifteen screen a hundred and ten a hundred and Fifteen degree days and X. men you know a month and a half two months since any significant rainfall things really go downhill quick\nYeah and and that's kind of what we saw well because\nOf the drought condition because coming out a way I was telling the season in in your part of the state so we had some drought conditions show or\nDidn't fare too well for the beginning of amber growth on our on our white pills it\nNo it really did and you know we didn't have just a a a a super winter um it was it was fairly dry\nAnd then a spring didn't didn't provide us any relief and in fact you know it was it was in the in the nineties in March\nAnd so the heat and the and the grass started really early and ah and I think we're we're seeing that in a in not only body weights and an aunt lived development that fond crops as well\nSo [noise] yeah it was ah it it's taken a toll\nYou know there is a term that's used by you biologist where you talk about foreign recruitment phone survival I'm just real quick give give us all inside due to the differences are those\nWell you know I'm One has to do with um how many fond make it to 'em you know a certain age six months or a year's worth\nOf age but Fonda crowd whenever we generally talk about a foreigner crop it's it's you know how many fond are hitting the ground how how many how many how many fond are being born and so [noise]\nUm there's a couple of things that goes on a you know and in winter and early spring if that does Arnie in good condition if there's there's poor range conditions\nUm a lot of those bonds won't even be born ... there'll be stillborn or you know have problems and then kind of what happened\nThis year was um [noise]\nFor the most part we had quite a few fond man born but conditions are so bad when they came into this world that are ... and didn't get better during the early part of their life you know they didn't make it the first couple of weeks or months that their life and so there's\nThere's two ways of of ah not getting on Chino to that to that adult stage and and that's that's kind of what happened this year\nGot you you know you're part of the state uh I've enjoyed hunting up there for years and years and years and uh there's places up there that just half a nominal a coil hunting when we've got quail but uh again drought kind of caught our ground nesting birds particularly our our ...\nMan you know the the I guess the peak of of Bob likes um patches and and asking activity as an engineer and\nYou know early part Asian and we're right in the middle of the heat and drought and so uh and had a lot of hot day and a lot of grad days after that so kind of like a fall on the chicks that were hatched um just just didn't make it very long\nWell a couple of years a couple of years ago though didn't we have a few years where we were shown a rebound now how does a bad year correlate to what a mercurial rehab from those are better ranchers\nOil you know a ... a short lived fired and so all life expectancy is less than two years on average and so I'm really dependent on\nLast year's crop of birds to to carry over and so last year was was not a great hatch either\nAnd so we started off with with the euro adults to to produce those chicks and then we had a really bad hatch and so this fall as is looking pretty is for for oil honey\nYou know sitting down here in Houston when I watch a weather radar and every now and then I'll see a the radar light up in your part of the state and I get excited going come on rain on Israel\nTo wear a or doing a rain dance out here\nAnd it was just in the last thirty days since um we did the report for the magazine have you gotten any ... any signs that maybe we're starting to see 'em a maybe a wetter trim coming\nWell we did a not long after we talked to a lady just days it it started raining and uh actually to\nTo look at most of our country now you'd never know that we were in a severe drought you know back to three months ago um we get some ten plus finches a while in some places and so for the most part the current habitat conditions\nUm they don't really tell the tale because things look really good um but but it's what happened you know during those critical times are back earlier in the spring and summer that it's going to be affecting what hunters experience in the woods spirit hunter hunting season\nAre you a school me well and that's the next question I Want to ask um given the conditions are given the moisture are we seeing unfold Forbes come up or is that pendulum still ah over on the hunter side um we're we're going to be moving all more this year\nWell I think it's a mixed bag hum is we are getting a lot of of fall Forbes and uh and that's good um you know in an ice cream crops are are\nAre spotty or to the point where you know some areas of the district the the biologist says than it's a bumper crop of like ... and others it's it's a bust you know so um that's going to be\nDespotic so I think in general though hundreds you're gonna have to they're going to have to hunt pretty hard for that trophy here um I think most of the trophies are going to come out of the the older age class here rather than a you know younger dear I'm In really good years you see good\nConditions and in those younger deer can really excel but I think it's going to be a bed and asked me an average to to maybe below average year for the young and middle age class there so so there's trophies after you're just going to have to look for an older dear I Believe\nGot you one final question we got about thirty seconds before we take a break um twenty eleven were pretty well put that in our review mirror we're talking about age or older age going on so we still are seeing some on six may have seven and a half year old dear that I'm I'm maybe we're not impacted by twenty eleven\nI I think we're I think we get that in our rear view mirror I'm sure they've um you know this this year may be one that that we need to look at you know three four five years from now say you know it was that was the cause I'm just like twenty eleventh\nVery good All right Kevin listen we appreciate the update our first guest Kevin mode north Texas district leader
