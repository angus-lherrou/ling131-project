that's me\nMy ... a real quick it's just a quick question I Know you know prior to the election Trump getting elected sixteen you know there weren't a lot of people that were just like you know\nOvertly coming out the sport as the as the debates went on you know kind of hard to determine and he went on the attack was your show you know ever since you been on here I remember ... when he ran for mayor [laughter] anyway\nWhen you know you're you're skeptical and march made it work what do you feel like in this upcoming election\nThat there's folks like yourself that\nYou don't make you didn't see things that he'd be that great and President Trump turning around dreams off all that what's your what's your opinion on\nA you know here's the pro\nUm\nIt's hard to have that conversation\nI have come to the conclusion that my opinion of Donald Trump is not particularly important is just not um\nAnd for me to express what is a very complicated\nA\nI did not wish for Trump to fail those not Michael I believed\nThat Trump would be an awful president I Believe that he would be sort of a Jeff Flake a guy who got elected as a Republican governor as a Democrat I believed that in good faith based on his past\nI didn't ... it was it that I was ignorant of the life of Donald Trump I had done a lot of research and I believed that he would be awful but I hoped he would be good\nAnd the reason is I don't let my ego get in the way of the much bigger issue I'm going to be dead and gone and my children are going to be my age and I want them to live in a great country\nAnd I don't think that that's a fait accompli I don't think that it's naturally the case that this country will be great thirty five years from now just because we've always been great I think we have to make good decisions\nI think that it's hard work to stay at the top you see countries that rise and fall\nIf if you look at the the change in fortunes in China\nIn India for instance\nIf you look at where Japan was in currently is well Vietnam for that matter or\nCambodia country's rise and fall based on decisions that they make\nAnd I want our country it'd be great I'm fine I'm financially secure I have a great job or I get to do what I Love to do my family's all healthy knock on wood I mean I'm pretty lucky guy\nSo I don't need to be right I Am delighted that I'm wrong about Donald Trump and I say it often\nTo me that's the measure of a man can you admit when you make a mistake that's the measure of a man most people will readable most people will will will backfill\nMe out of hand\nA man\nMan\nOr the time that racism in America style man it's time\nThat black people stop beating up on other black people who dare to have an opinion it's time that the stupid black people stop bullying the smart black people\nIt's time that the clowns who've been owned by the Democrat Party stop attacking black people who don't get sucked into being a Democrat\nYou know there's plenty of black people who are investment bankers entrepreneur mirrors doctors lawyers business owners pastors who have their own opinions\nBut I Know basketball players mon I'm already mad at you today you know that pushed not bother me I'm by the way for anyone wondering Ramon offended me earlier today\n\nThe barest a lot of people but it's not made me do that right now so I'm you\nBlack people who claimed black lives matter that's not what that means that means thugs who tried to kill cops shouldn't be killed by the cops who defend themselves\nCan't we all just said what is the truth and stop worrying if the leftist mad most\nPeople believe Christine Ford lied\nAnd they know that the Democrats were going to do anything to destroy this guy\n\nMost people know that most not every most every black guy gets killed by a cop was himself trying to kill a cop and has a a a wrap sheet a mile long\nIf you were a thug who stands on the street corner gang banging forty adults in dealing and killing people and the cops pull up to break up your ring and you go to kill a cop and he kills you you're not a victim and I don't care if you're on the or your grandmother said so\nI've had media
