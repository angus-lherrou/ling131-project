I Know there there were great they regret nobody bought they're proud of what they were great they were true to their mission ... sell anything and then their investors lost their their high eighties but they were they were great people because\nDidn't give people what they wanted they gave people what they didn't want and therefore people chose not to purchase their product is dumb every body wants ratings every body wants ratings make no mistake about it\nBut let me explain for a moment and again I I don't mean to patronize if you understand this it seems pretty straightforward but it's important to understand why ratings are important\nTo CNN ratings are more important to CNN than they are to me and let me explain why\nFirst stations like CNN or for music stage stations on the radio [noise]\nMost of the advertising which is where the money is made right you don't pay to consume the show you get it free but the trick is if we can get a bunch of you to listen\nThen companies will pay to have their names said all of you so that while you were in the middle of listening you will hear their name right\nNo matter what the radio that's how it works so they pay the station so the station puts this product out to you free and the station receives money to in addition to the content to throw in some references to car dealers or a electricians or whatever restaurants whatever that may be\nThe higher the ratings more listeners\nThe more listeners the more they'll pay\nBecause you pay more to get to talk to a hundred thousand people than to talk to a thousand people so sure every station every show wants to have the highest ratings higher the ratings are more of the money and it's purchased in terms of water called points and I don't want to go too far into the weeds here\nBut the more listeners viewers for TV stations you have the more you can sell your ad to tide or Chevrolet or Ford or whatever food packaging company or anything else so of course they share\nThe same thirty second ad on CNN [noise]\nThe same at the same created the whole deal that runs during the super bowl\nWill sell for a hundred times more I don't know how much more it's probably a hundred times do you know why\nBecause there is a hundred dollars more people watching the super bowl than seeing in the more people that watch the more you can charge for the same exact thirty seconds you see a TV station only have so many hours in the day they can sell advertising on\nThey only have so many spots at some point you stretch that you can't go any further so the more people that are viewing or in radio listening\nWell the reason I care less about it\nIs I don't have to have ratings we do but I don't have to because I have qualitative I don't have quantitative you see stations that are talking to people that are Eighteen to thirty for what are you selling those people\nDiapers and Coca Cola\nMaybe some beer\nThe people that are listening to our show have money you're older you're more financially secure hats who the advertisers want if you're trying to sell a roof to somebody or an eye surgery or most anything else you go where the money yes\nRight why do you Rob banks that's random money yeah so I don't have to worry how many people are listening as we're qualitative but enough of that John Stewart talking about the president in what exactly he does the gets their goat and this is from a guy who's not his fan stay tuned we'll talk about\nTo do your thing because obviously we're all caught up in this sort of daily come fast I mean every single newspaper every radio station every bit of social media\nGot to make money to well I say you got bills to pay man you've got electric bills you got food you know this guy is he's giving you all\nCash the cash flow and the Trump era for uh\nFor the TV stations over\nThere's going to say that might have been an issue and maybe instead of the nation for the people who are the bean counters that we're
