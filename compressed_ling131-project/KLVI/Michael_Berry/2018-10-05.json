anyway and even if anybody did want to have sex with them they\nHave so confused and disoriented and perverted sex to take any joy out of the process\nThey want to talk about their periods constantly

from making sure that\nOne of our families made it to our shows and I think that's what we pride ourselves on we pride ourselves on a surrounding ourselves with families and\nEnsuring that entertainment or at our shows is for families and yeah man I ...\nThe first time I saw there was a line already form and I got there and then what it was it was all families\nYou know and that was that's a beautiful thing to see you had kids were in the championship belt and bright going in and what I liked about it man I saw I saw\nA kids coming in with shirts from from you guys in a stroller Galactica and other independent stars and ... that are out there so it's kind of like this cool underground things do they listen to the surface of the great things are happening that is a lot of people a lot of\nPeople really are open their eyes when they realized that independent wrestling exist when I when I very first ever went to a show and it was it was hurricane pro originally under a company called Gulf Coast power pro Russian foreign minister of Italy and the\nVery first coming to a show I of course I grew up watching wrestling shied away from it\nOr had some friends take me to a show never never in my wildest dreams what I've imagined that you're not be where I Am today just just watching it and sitting there ten feet away from somebody who's doing something the exact same as I Would have seen on TV the balloon my mind yeah that somebody in a in a National Guard armory or in a civic center\nYes performing the exact same stuff that you see on WWE sometimes at a higher level\nYeah and that and that's the interesting thing to me correct you see some guys out there and I'm like going on like to watch that match on ...\n... you know there's that moment might improve the ratings [laughter] yeah now obviously they're incredible people like a styles and others are doing right the guys out there that the only difference with some of them is they haven't got the backing or the opportunity right as well and that's one\nThing that I that I strive to push on people and you guys like a J styles who spent years and years and years on the independent level yeah even before making it ever to TNA sure I mean I Know guys he's personally wrestle yeah yeah on a level and you know if\nIt's if people only knew that your next breakout star\nIs the guy you're paying ten dollars to sit in the front row and watch that's a that's a cool concept people just ... it's really hard for people to grasp that that that's what we ... we we strive to press that's why a hurricane pro post all the time\nA Johnny flex is on raw Nathan Bradley's on raw this guy that guy this guy we would like to show our fan the opportunities that these guys are getting and what level that they're at sure how close they are to being\nThe next break out and what will happen sometimes like maybe they'll come to a town like Houston and they'll pick one of ... up with somebody from reality rest and the one of the Texas all star someone corrected say hey we need somebody for this particular ... maybe it's the oldest God's about you know that kind of thing or girl because that's what I like now is when I when I first started getting interested he'll like Wendy Richter\n[laughter] and yeah like the ... ... ... and rock and Robin and a few others the kid right but my lord has it increased and um\nIt it's an incredible concept and the girl the female things are tired of what we're talking about we're going to talk about how wrestling wildlife and promoting kids believing
