confirmation\nA large Kandahar\nThe idea of the moderate you know Lindsey Graham oh what a good week this has been for Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham was on Sean Hannity's show the other day I listen to the hand the five minutes and the last\nThree weeks and it was such good ... it was the best five minutes probably of his show because he had Lindsey Graham on and Lindsey Graham was going at it and Lindsey Graham was talking about the swamp\nAnd he was saying that you know what the swamp would normally do is kicked Kavanaugh out of the boat into the water throw him overboard and I'm thinking to myself Lindsey Graham is the most ... swamp figure there's ever been\nBut he has gone absolutely Tea Party populist conservative guy over this issue and I love it\nHe was telling reporters earlier today that he's going to vote for judge Kavanaugh I I Am ready to vote I'm ready I'm ready now by the way they called a cloture vote and the theory goes that McConnell would not call a vote for cloture which means to close\nThe the discussion and vote unless he had his votes I don't know that in this case that's necessarily true and I'll tell you why in a minute but um that vote could be as early as friday I think it's going to happen on Saturday it looks like\nWell I'm going to go through some of the senators that we were worried about and\nAs of right now here we are a Thursday or as of right now it looks like the vote I if I were guessing I Would guess the votes going to be fifty four forty six\nUm there are some estimates that habit at fifty five forty five but don't under estimate the Hail Mary the left is going to throw now that they know that they have no chance of winning\nThey're going to get desperate right they're going to try for a knockout punch and and\nIn some ways that scares me because that means they're literally going to stop at nothing [noise] it it means\nThat the things they're going to try are going to be nuclear options it means that they're going to try things they never would have tried before because it's their only hope\nIt means that all their trickle ration all their their shenanigans it means that things that you would typically

she's very good to me\nShe makes me a better person she's ... she's the kind of person I Wish I was she's kind\nShe's January and she secure in herself she has nothing ill to say of other people she has no neurosis sees she's not in the U.S she's not pride full she's just kind\nAnd so I don't know what it's like to go through a divorce other than feeling like I've gone through a few with my friends over the years and it always seems that a person that was otherwise a nice person when they're going through a divorce\nYou see the worst of um you you see the the fangs come out in the clause go up well this woman who screaming is what I imagine every man out there kind of pictures for their ex wife\nShe's this shrieking heartbeat of a cat lady and she starts screaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation I knew it was one of the Democrats I couldn't remember it turns out it was Joe mansion now this is a tip ahead of time that he's going to vote for confirmation\nRather these guys something can come in at the last minute and I don't mean effect change I I mean a powerful interest can\nCome in and and change their opinion for them at the last minute somebody can say hey you're going to lose you know the endorsement of the biggest union in the state\nFor instance ah are you know they're going to come out in ... but by and large\nIt's probably the case when a senator like Joe mansion in West Virginia a state that\nThat Donald Trump won by ... percentage points it's hard to put into perspective what kind of pressure this puts on mansion ah who's up for reelection it's hard to put into perspective how fearful he\nIs of losing his Senate seat these guys will do anything to hold on to their Senate seat in the thing and he's\nGot to have a lot of people who voted for Donald Trump vote for him a lot of people now even lose and by forty percentage points there still thirty percent of West Virginians that voted for Hillary\nSo he's got to keep from alienating them but they typically understand hey he's got to do some things he's got to not be with us sometimes in order to pick up enough votes to get to fifty one percent because we're not a majority in this state so we're going to let him have this vote but\nThat doesn't mean that every women's group and every university group and the state's going to give him a free pass so he's got the challenge over here that he's got to keep his crazy liberal left he's a you know corralled and and rally them to all vote for him and\nIf the state is truly Seventy thirty I don't think it is I think it's probably closer to fifty eight forty two let's just say it's fifty five forty five he's still got to get all his Democrats and then pick up twenty to thirty five percent of Republicans and that's not always easy\nBut mansion has been able to do that he's been able to build support across party lines\nAs the parties have split as they have fractured it makes it very hard for a red state Democrats for a Democrat and a Republican state because it's no longer the case that you can simply say well I'm bringing home the bacon\nOr hey don't you want a guy in both parties representing you hey don't you want\nTo have power when the Democrats are back when you have a moment like Kavanaugh where the Democrats go slash and burn to the extent that they have where the media\nHas has polarized this issue sol sol aggressively you leave no room in the middle\nYou you you make it so that there is no agree to disagree there's no respect for the other side\nWhen they started accusing this man of outright rape when Michael ... being paraded across CNN everyday when the New York times is writing editorials that are basically basically saying\nBrett Kavanaugh's rapist and so is every white male conservative people at home see this remote when you pull for me the audio remember Hillary Clinton went to India after she lost and she said the reason\nI lost was these was these women who\nDon't think for themselves they just do what their husbands tell them to\nYou know moments like that are so powerful but my great frustration is that people tend to forget about him and the reason is they choose to forget about 'em if most Americans understood\nAnd if you haven't watched any of it yet then I'm envious of you go home tonight\nUh download it and you were just being watched four or five or six of these there's only one season so far in the new one is that the new and starts this week or no I'm Sorry it it starts November second\nIf you enjoy music and you enjoy rock docks and you enjoy the history behind musicians you will enjoy this\nSo they\nThe over arching\nIssue around the Kavanaugh's nomination yes it's a lifetime appointment\nBut there is the big issue of the fact that the midterms the voting is going to start and you know ... what are we thirty one thirty two were about thirty days from election day but\nWe're just a few days from early voting I'm going to bag and I don't do that or else I'm going to bag our listeners every Texan out there to cast their vote on the first day of early voting and get your Ted Cruz vote in\nFor a number of reasons I'm not the least of which is to show the left you see the reason they've spent a fortune on Beto O'Rourke\nIs to send a message to Democrats across the country\nIf we can win Texas we can win anywhere of course the Democrats can win California their politics or lack of course the Democrats can win Oregon of course the Democrats can win New York\nAnd Vermont but\nIf we can break that that red wall of Texas\nThen that means we can begin to take back\nThe new south we can take back those red states we can take back the states of the gun owning conservative rancher suburban night small business owner veteran these are areas they can't crack anymore their politics or to whack\nSo if they could find a candidate a stealth Trojan Horse candidate to send in and they know they can mobilize the left\nThe sort of like West Virginia that ain't gonna get you there you've got to be able to convince suburban moms what they called in two thousand what Al Gore and George W. Bush battled over which was the soccer mom\nThey were trying to convince the soccer mom the suburban soccer mom that ... was the guy\nAnd so that's why they had to humanize him you know he loves music he was in a band he said water burger he does air drumming he's just like you he's got a nickname and they needed to excite blacks and Hispanics and young people and that was the recipe and it looked good\nBecause they got a steady dose of earned media from across the country\nRolling Stone magazine took a break from making up UVA a rape case\nA articles which they had to settle for and wrote glowing stories about him the New York times wrote glowing stories the national magazine of Texas Texas Monthly which is very liberal but he's read across the state and and well respected they wrote glowing reviews on him\nThe newspapers the Houston Chronicle San Antonio express the Dallas\nMorning news day all wrote glowing reviews on him bought a great guy and they never talked about his policies because his policies would turn the voters off they didn't want to tell you he's a gun grabber they they\nActually originally reported on him saying he would vote to impeach a Trump he was the first member of Congress to come out and say he would vote to impeach Trump\nWell at the time he did it he had to mobilize the American left to get excited about the Senate race down in Texas\nAs we've gotten closer and closer to the vote he's embarrassed by that because now the Trump voters some of whom had problems with Ted Cruz because they ran against each other and they were still suffering with bearing the hatch it even though Ted Cruz did and even though Donald Trump did a lot of those voters are now going wait a second\nI don't want the senator from my state leading the charge to impeach my president when he's doing a very good job so that's made people go I'm going to vote against that guy\nThen you've got the Soros money that's come into the state of Texas and that that has really offended people but\nThen you've got this this cabinet case where you know people don't realize how bad it is to live under Democrat tyranny\nUntil they're reminded by having to do it\nYou forget how awful the Democrats are you forget how low morale was in the Obama presidency once he's gone because it's a coping technique\nYou don't want to have to be negative all the time you don't want to have to have at top of mind how angry you were at those people and how they treated you\nAnd it's not until you've gotta Kavanaugh case that you see that delivering idiot Blumenthal up there it's not until Feinstein is up there is not until Chuck Schumer is holding press conferences it's not until Durban doing his thing\nAnd uh you know um\nThat sort of thing just reminds people that sort of thing simply reminds people\nYou know what I got to get out I Know Canada is perfect Ted Cruz is not perfect Donald Trump is not perfect Republicans have a tendency to do something that Democrats don't and that is eat our own we have a tendency to say if you are not perfect\nThen I'll stay home I'll vote for the other side or I'll stay home and that's why we lose elections we should when I've never seen Republicans this United behind an issue\nLike the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nUh I haven't seen that in a long time in a very long time in in some ways well I I guess the Trump presidency did because they were uniting not just behind Trump but against Hillary\nThese are invigorating times and it shows the establishment look [noise]\nWhen you guys that fried look you can win [noise]\n\nIf the garage door at your home or office needs to be service repaired or replaced overhead door company of Beaumont also locations in Dayton Jasper and Lake Charles there's one close to you they also have a wide range of storm and security shutters\nIf you're looking for some extra protection at home or at the office for oh nine eight six six\nTwenty five thirty five day or night so put their phone number ... eight six six twenty five thirty five it seems like everybody I Know that has a suburban or rural property is going to ...
