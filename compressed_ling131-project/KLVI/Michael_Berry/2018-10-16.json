I wrote about was that when you see these kinds of things being said it is inciting people and frankly it's not the direction that we should be going it's not what our country is all about they were great country\nThat that celebrates the fact we can actually disagree with each other we can disagree with our government but there was a way to resolve it your result your differences at the ballot

that you're seeing an increase of this uh you know look I I Would like to see leaders on both sides calling it out\nHere saying leaders on on the right calling it out you're not seeing any leaders on the left call laid out in fact you're seeing some of the leaders on the left inciting more violence calling on more violence instead of saying there's no place for it I'd I'd like to see the

but why the rhetoric to her directly sir\nWell I've spoken to a number of them directly and and I think the ones that I've spoken to\nA you know some of them get it some of them do but ultimately we've got to keep shining a light on this to make it clear that this isn't what politics is about an America it's not what the founding of our country was about it was about freedom of speech freedom

you bastard how dare you say that to this man like he hasn't done enough\nWell after Seattle did that and then rescinded at San Francisco's having their whole ... next month the city will vote on proposition ...\nWhich will raise over three hundred million dollars to add to the already three hundred eighty million dollars per year the city spends on their homeless problem\nHowever instead of a levy on the number of employees proposition C is essentially another income tax for companies that called the city home\nThe new mayor of San Francisco London Breed has said she has problems with the lack of accountability in the measure apparently the proposition does not provide enough checks and balances on how to account for the three hundred million dollars raised oh don't worry how the money spent\nJust make sure we got a law that nobody ever looks at how we spend the money on the homeless it's all how we can get more of it\nQuote by dramatically increasing our homelessness spending without working with neighboring counties proposition C could put us in the tenable she says the untenable inexpensive position\nOf funding services for residents from other counties [noise]\nSan Francisco cannot solve homelessness simply by writing ever larger checks itself\nThere is a limit to what we should and can spend\nOh Mitt all what you can spend on the homeless\nOh no this can't happen there can never be a limit to what you spend on the children on the homeless\nOn the environment there is an unlimited amount because\nRich people [noise] apparently um mayor breathe is figured out that the more money you spend on homelessness which by the way this is true\nThe more homeless you have I've told a story on air before so forgive me if you've heard this multiple times but Ted Koppel did especially used in a few years ago I was in the city council at the time we have to be there\nAnd it was comparing homelessness in Houston to homelessness in San Francisco\nAnd they took to people who were homeless in San Francisco and two people who were homeless in Houston and they compared the resources [noise]\nIf you're homeless in Houston you can sleep on the street which violates

organization then there are some others but star hope is probably the most prominent in ... I think probably the most effective in the greater Houston community so the homeless guys in in Houston they get a place to stay and they get food\nUm and\nThat's it right because\nWe were not big believe you know we're not going to build a castle for you\nAnd then they went to the to homeless people they chose at random in San Francisco and life was really good they were getting so much more in fact the homeless\nThis outreach there it's almost as if they make homelessness inducted into a job\nBeing homeless is like your career can live pretty well off of it but\nI don't tell you that the point that out because you would have expected\nThe city of San Francisco rather than spending on roads and police of\nThe things that matter it's going to have higher taxes and more\n... for the homeless\nIn fact so many goodies for the homeless that some people\nWho were homeless end up moving from places like Houston to San Francisco for a better job if you will the job of being homeless\nThe two people they chose were from Houston\nThey were homeless from Houston the homeless like every other community has their network they pass information the kittens good in San Francisco\nSo they hop a greyhound bus and they get to San Francisco and they immediately show up signing up no questions asked and they have a whole new career in beautiful San Francisco\nAnd what we learn from it is\nThat you can become what is known in the law as an attractive nuisance\nYou can you can induce the very behaviors you don't want by subsidizing them there's a famous public policy study known as the Indian cobra\nEffect they had a problem in an Indian Village with cobra is so they paid you to bring in for every cobra you brought it they found that the more they paid out the more cobra as they seem to have yeah because people wanted to cobra farming started raising\nCobra and getting paid for bringing them in so instead of reducing the cobra population by paying people you gave them a perverse incentive to make the problem worse and\nThere is liberalism in a nutshell\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWhen you're banquet community bank to excess you experienced all the things you want from a business bank and none of the things you don't when it comes to service you can also not hurdles you work with people who believe in relationships gamesmanship because we're here to serve you know some nerve your\nCommunity bank affects us we do everything we can to focus on you forget your\nCommunity bank affects business banking better\nMember of the housing what\nAre you a real cowboy dogs will get your movie tickets on a salvage job approval rating river to probably sponsored by somebody's got to be on the honoring the wind be enjoyed accidentally Mickey dealing in Johnny ...\nMouth watering the exciting when final noxious a chance to win a gas powered golf carts you're much more for a while the American Cancer Society on lifetime really search for you all for taking nine four five seven six or business sep ... dot com and\nThis is Todd ... that's the bottom line Jean Baylor any and are bringing you the latest in financial news and political commentary Saturday from six to seven AM and on Sundays from eleven to be sure to listen daily for our financial news updates during Rush Limbaugh and the Michael berry show right here on this top five sixty Sylvia\nHas pleaded guilty to one count of giving a false statement to the FBI when there was an investigation into the leaks from the Senate intelligence committee to reporters Mm that's interesting\nWolfgang some degree of notoriety when it was discovered that he had been and they may September relationship with New York times reporter alley Watkins\nThe two had been an item for about three years before she joined the paper Wolfe was in charge of maintaining all classified information coming from the executive branch to the Senate panel\nHe served as the panels security director for twenty nine years that's a long time and it goes all the way back to George W.
