would pause he would scream lock her up\nI don't like Hillary Clinton I Do think she's committed crimes and I would like to see her pursued\nBy the criminal justice system because I think it destroys morale I think there was a rot in the body politic\nWhen an individual at that high level is allowed to get away with what I think she got away with but to scream lock her up while\nThe president is talking about the various planks of his platform was at a minimum distracting\nEveryone around me would turn and look at the guy he's having a great time he's under the influence of nothing because they didn't sell in the alcohol and he's been waiting all day for the seat\nAnd I kinda giggled inwardly thinking to myself that gosh probably felt shut out by the political process his entire life to the extent even had an interest in ... he feels empowered tonight now\nDo I wish he'd quit screaming yeah I'd actually like to hear what the president has to say but I can also recognize that he's pretty excited maybe he's all jacked up all Mountain Dew\nHe fell at that moment that that guy up there on the stage speaks for him and I bet\nYou he's never felt that way before in his entire life\nHe felt in bold and an hour and he felt comfortable being able to screen things out\nSome of the other things he screamed out some F bombs totally inappropriate in a place like that awful nobody stopping 'cause nobody wanted to kill the moment he was haven't\nNo I Would tell you when I hear things like that I cringe cringe because I don't want that to be projected as what Republicans are\nNot because I'm embarrassed that he's got awful teeth a cheap hair cut\nIs obviously worked outside his entire life he's probably aged far more than his number of years he's not had an easy life you can see it on his face you can tell it in his countenance but at this moment\nHe's proud of who and what he is and he knows what he is what he is not\nWhat has tended to happen in the past is that the

of of Trump and uh what's the guy's name that he that he body slams Vincent man\nBut Trump understands how to put on the show he understands how to excite had an insight and ... he understands how to rally people\nThere were people screaming at that rally last night that I bet you have never screamed at a political rally before last night\nRepublicans have traditionally typically put up candidates who talk about guns and gun and patriotism and how the Democrats are bad\nPeople and completely bored to tears Trump understands what moves that guy now wherever you\nAre on the educational totem pole socio economic manners culture which are put in quotes high culture refinement sophistication civil civilized behavior whatever you want to\nCall it I Will posed this question why is it that American politics has celebrated the efforts by the Democrats to reach out to poor blacks\nTo reach out to poor Hispanics\nAnd bring them into the political process\nAnd make offers to them not always on the basis of the most high minded ambition not always on a visionary aspirational basis sometimes on the basis that don't you hate widely 'cause he sure hate you but it's okay because these are poor black people that we're finally getting excited about the political process\n\nSo why is it wrong to reach out to poor white people why is it wrong to reach out to the working class white guy why is it wrong when he feels good about himself\nBecause the media are white liberal elites and some of them come from some of those families that they're making fun of they have to destroy the poor uncouth
