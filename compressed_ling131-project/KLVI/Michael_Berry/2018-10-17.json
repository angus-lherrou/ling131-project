watch your dance if it's All right with you because you\nSo here we are two years yeah [noise]\nAnd I will confess I have worried that Mueller who is very crafty very sly very clever very mean nasty man\nThat he would give the impression he was going to indict Trump and then he would do it right before the midterms I had been afraid of that I did not give voice to that but I've been afraid of that\nAnd I'm Still not sure that will happen\nI don't know that he could get an indictment there's an old line and legal circles that are good prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich sort of like the old line at the earlier level and the criminal justice process you can beat the rat but you can't beat the ride\nYou know anybody can sue you\nYou can throw it out of court but that means you didn't get sued\nAnd if you're getting married tomorrow and the story emerges that you've been arrested or you've been sued or you've been accused your future inlaws Meg oh let's put off this election for I mean this uh marriage for a couple of weeks we might be dealing with the bad guy what turns out he didn't do anything wrong\nBut at that moment the accusation will always have hanging in the air well maybe it's true and I've been worried that Mueller would do this\nBut now there is considerable speculation and this is where the game of chicken begins this is where it gets complicated in this is where Trump is good Trump met with roses team recently when air force one\nThe expectation was Trump was going to fire Rosenstein and number two at the department of justice roses scenes one who appointed a special prosecutor it all goes back to Jeff Sessions\nSessions after he becomes attorney general\nHe then says oh allegations of Russian collusion\nWell I was a part of the campaign I had meetings I'm going to step down when he stepped down the guy he would've never appointed a special prosecutor special ... but when he stepped down Rod Rosenstein steps in and says\nWe're going to bring in Robert Mueller\nA close friend of Jim Comey insists the president has fired combing we're gonna bring in the special prosecutor this special counsel and we're basically going to tour meant Trump and there's no reason to believe they're going to stop anytime soon\nThis is where it gets to be like a game of battle did you play by ... as a good game as quality game\nIs a quality gay you\nCall it out then they might an electric where do you have electronic version they had the electronic version [noise] if you put your your piece in a certain spot in their cars aren't it would make up like a blow up south yeah we had to do it like gotcha cute for to be one\nBattle she you remember so you just moved to pieces okay All right well now we've got a game of cat and mouse high stakes cat and mouse\nBecause Mueller if he presents his evidence before the ... terms he gets to own the news cycle for a day or two there's no doubt about that so if he wanted the damage Trump\nIn the most egregious way and I believe he does\nIf he wanted to damage Trump\nI Want to be so good I Want to be that\nAmong the best what I've done a one on one day where that Jack and be sworn in to

behind me and the lectern in the flag the room crowded and Fox News carrying live and the president put the metal around my neck they don't think in those terms\n\nAnd I think maybe that's what makes it special is that they did not compromise\nOr cash in our sellout or pursue their simply being recognized\nFor incredible incredible valor and\nWhen that blue ribbon goes around their neck and the president ties it in the back\nThey have the\nThe the look on their face seemingly life this is taking forever\n'cause these aren't the highest ranking guys in the military they're not used to the

right\nHugging the Republicans have been hitting Menendez heart over the\nUnderage prostitutes down in the Dominican Republic but\nI'm not sure it's going to matter I'm increasingly of the opinion that Democrats don't care as long as they went so now Chuck Schumer is going to drop three million dollars in what should have been a safe Democrat seat\nThree million dollars you know they probably could use some of that thirty eight million that ... has raised mark my words\nWhen this election is over Beto O'Rourke in Texas will be sitting on a huge chunk of change if he only wanted to win\nThe Senate seat from Texas He would spend every penny of it but he won't and he hasn't and the reason is made though knows he can't win a seat the more money they spend the further he falls behind\nEnd up losing fifty five forty five it might even be fifty six forty four he'll lose about ten percent\nWhich he's down consistently by seven points or more and then you have to factor in the turnout model remember that when they show these polls they don't just randomly interview six hundred to a thousand people\nHave estimates on what percentage of people are going to be Republicans and what percentage of going to be Democrats that show up to vote [noise] they have estimates on percentage of old people and young people that are going to show up to vote may have estimates on city in in rural and so they go find that many votes that many poll respond to ease\nBut what you can't factor in\nIs the people that they model will show up and vote\nIn the yard signs don't vote rallies don't vote\nYou have a rally on the campus of university which has been hitting hard over the last\nMonth and some people are coming out of class camera ancestor Morgan says to\nChloe hey what are you are
