Ratcliffe says that Simpsons testimony is at odds with the testimony that Bruce or with the department of justice gave last month quote\nThe reason for that is it Glen Simpson had previously testified under oath to the house intelligence committee that he never met with Bruce or or discussed with Bruce or the Steele dossier prior to the October application that stuff\nPfizer application in two thousand sixteen or the two thousand sixty and presidential election [noise] that is in direct contradiction to what Bruce or told me under oath last\nMonth I Am not surprised Mr Sampson is taking the

if they did what I suspect they did they committed high crimes\nThey committed crimes at such a level\nThat they threaten our republic and I don't say that lightly they committed crimes that must be punished to the full extent of the law and I hope they are let's get to the president on sixty minutes over the weekend\nI think he had a very good weekend and I think he's become very very good at this I'm going to play for you some clips of his interview with Leslie stall and I want you to see how on message he remains\nSome people when they get into a meeting like this Leslie stall is a very talented journalist she's very good\nShe will mix one part familiarity with another part respect and almost sort of a false I'm\nA false praise and then come back with a short of overbearing school ... attitude that demands you tell the truth it would be a mistake to underestimate how good she is that what she does nevertheless\nTrump went into that meeting absolutely kept his cool that she tried she really wanted him to lose his cool\nAnd he didn't and he stayed focused and where it matters I don't think that that Donald Trump won you know Dianne Feinstein over to his side I don't think he won the ... of the Democratic party over to his side\nBut I Do think among his base in middle America\nI think he comes off very strong during this interview let's go through some clips of it she begins\nBy asking him these sort of deep questions that that Morocco bomb it used to love\nYou know what what do you dream about what is your fear she's trying to make a headline out of this interview and Trump looks are dead in the eye and basically says you people are liars is the cheats you knaves I don't trust you\nAnd I don't think most Americans do here's what he said\nFirst president to the United states who never had a political posts before we're never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned\nSince you've been president okay so I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guys and Bob [noise] now I say the babies who did that has the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nIt is a vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at\nI'm going to tell you where the quotes are that they put around his comments which would suggest that they were which would know not which would state that they were taking his words directly and that would be important they wrote President Trump says quote Robert elite was a great general\nEnd quote during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader quote incredible in quote\nWell even liberals in the media came out in criticized what they had done\nEven liberals in the media came out in distance themselves from what NBC had done\nHere is the president's comments now I happen to think as many military historians do that Robert really was a very effective general\nAnd I think one of the factors in his favor\nOn that subject is the fact that President Lincoln sought to employ him in a senior position within the union army in fact he was invited to the ... to the White House so that the case could be made that\nHe not break off and lead his fellow Virginians which he did the fifth but that he lead the union\nHe had a lineage at West point which was nothing short of spectacular um and in a union wanted his services and be the one to keep them away from the Confederate he's been regarded\nThroughout history by military who's historians as a very bright effective successful tactician\nNow there's been in the last Twenty years in an attempt to discredit his military act commitment and that's fine it's based in the fact that it's based in this\nSort of revisionist some of the confederacy was awful therefore anything that went on there\nIf they developed a cure for cancer in a Confederate\nA I'm a medical tent they\nWould have declared that it wasn't such a great I'm a discovery after\nAll I mean that it's it's that bad but the point I'm making here is the military\nIs attempt to smear the president by taking words that I said military the media's attempt to smear the president by taking words out of context is backfiring\nOver and over and over again because increasingly Americans don't believe them and increasingly they give Americans every reason not\nTo believe that here is the president's actual statement and I would I Would beg to find anyone who could disagree\nWith anything he says here you're free to have your own opinions but there's certainly nothing he says here\nThat that speaks to white supremacy or anything of of of the store and NBC had the ... had to come back and do something they rarely do and correct their article and admit that what they said he said he didn't say here's what he did say\nOh I always say that gave us\nA great president who has been properly recognized OK William McKinley has not been properly racket [noise]\nWhat he did and in terms of fray\nIn terms of war but in terms of brain and I hate to say it in terms of being smart and tariffs William McKinley has not been properly recognized but maybe someday he will\n[noise] it also gave you [noise] a general who is incredible he\nDrank a little bit too much [noise] you know I'm Talking about [noise] so Robert Daly it was a great general [noise]\nAds Abraham Lincoln\nDeveloped a phobia he couldn't be Robert Ley\nHe was going crazy I don't know if you do this but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln mom is that I can speak Robert Daly and the and all of these generals they look great they were the top of that class at West point they were the greatest\nPeople there's only one problem they didn't know how to hell to when they didn't know how to fight [noise] they didn't know how and one day it was looking really bad\nAnd Lincoln just said you hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem\nAnd Lincoln said I don't get what probably as you guys aren't winning\n[noise] and his name was grant general [noise]\n\nAnd he went in and hey knock the hell out of everyone [noise]\nAnd you know the story they said the Lincoln you can use them anymore\nHe's an alcoholic\nAnd Lincoln said [noise] I don't care if he's an alcoholic frankly give me six or seven more just like [noise] we started to win grant really did he had a serious problem a serious drinking problem but man was he a good general and he's finally being recognized as a great general but [noise]\nHad\nAlmost developed a phobia because he was having a hard time with a true great fighter and a great General Robert Italy but grant figured it out and grant is a great general and grand came from right here [noise]\nSo they took him out of context but what is more saying that Robert ... was\nA great general in order to build up this victory that that grant and executed above him just a moment I'm going to read to you\nFrom some presidents of the past Republicans and Democrats over the last almost a hundred years as to how they describe properly and I'll tell you what if today we're supposed to believe he was an awful general we sure have had a lot of presidents\nWho went out of their way to tell us how great a general he was [noise] but that's not what President Trump was praising grant NBC took on Trump they lied and they lost

person in history in and I'll leave that to your judgment\nBut credit to the Atlantic a liberal magazine credit to the Atlantic for putting together what some presidents have said about Robert ...\nFranklin Roosevelt president about eighty years ago\nPraised and and as liberal liberal as you get praise Robert Daly as quote a nightly figure without reproach and without fear\nA figure who is like a night and the reason for that because Robert de lead was considered the embodiment of the gym peel gentle respectful\nHonorable southerner FDR called him a nightly figure without reproach and without fear and he said that as\nHe was unveiling a statue of generally in Dallas texas where he also called him one of our greatest American Christians and one of our greatest American gentleman\nOne of our greatest American Christians and one of our greatest American gentleman it was very important for Iraq Obama to say that we are not a Christian nation\nWherever we once were we are no longer a Christian nation\nThat was once a time when presidents would say that we are not to say we are not welcoming to seek Hindu Muslim Jew Buddhist agnostic atheist rushed to ferry\nDwight David Eisenhower kept portraits of what he considered quote for great Americans on the oval office wall Ben Franklin George Washington Abraham Lincoln and Robert he ...\nHe told the United daughters of the confederacy that generally was quote a great and noble character and quote and generally quote remained always a pure soul\nAnother Democrat John F. Kennedy\nLooked upon leaves wartime service as a quote gallant\nFailure you did not win but he's sort of bravery Lyndon Johnson another Democrat\nCalled Robert The league quote a great son of the south a great leader of the south as the man he stood as the symbol of valor end of duty\nI'm Sorry that's actually from Gerald Ford Gerald Ford said as a man who stood as the symbol of valor and the duty\nThat was in a bill that he signed restoring Robert he leaves US citizenship\nJimmy Carter a Democrat said Roberts Lee was a man who understood the values of a region which he represented\nHe called him a great leader Reagan called Robert ... an American legend George W. Bush addressing the United states military academy called Robert ... the perfect West Point graduate\nSo the media criticized as Donald Trump for saying that US Grant the feeding Robert he was a major event because leave with such a good general\nAnd the media says oh I shouldn't do that when nothing less than West Point considers him\nTo have been one of the finest and his father before him by the way\nThis isn't a confederacy issue this isn't a in an attempt\nTo battle for the honor and dignity\nOf those who opposed\nWhat Lincoln's union represented this is simply another example\nOf trying to twist the words and actions of people in an attempt to swing an election to sway the opinions of people with dishonesty the same\nNetwork that used doctored photos of George Zimmerman's head\nWhen Trayvon Martin bang him on the floor on the on the asphalt\nIn an attempt to kill it\nAnd finally in ... in fear for his life his head busted opening gushing blood had to pull the trigger\nNBC doctored those photos so that they didn't look like his head was split wide open because they wanted it to be the case that Zimmerman wanted killed Trayvon then he killed him without provocation so they actually doctored the photos\nWhen you reached the point that you can no longer report the news but that you actually all through the news\nIn order to win your point\nHow can anyone trusts you after ... how can anyone ever trust you\nAnd so then the media is left considered on trustworthy their stories being called fake news nobody believing anything they say\nAn angry at UV idiot who believes Trump and not them and yet they keep engaging in\nThis nonsense and yet they keep thinking they can get away with this nonsense\nThey choose not to report on ... and their violence they choose to portray you or people in the Republican Party as violent mobs they won't let it be called a mob when Ted Cruz and his wife are run out of a restaurant where they're doing nothing more than trying to have dinner [noise]\nAnd I think it's going to cause them to lose [noise] think it's going to cause them to lose [noise]\nAnd I want to get to President Trump's interview on sixty minutes I think he was very very good coming out\nA way\n[noise] what are your best after all of his through ...
