of a press conference over all of this\nThat his office had received a ball well hadn't they did receive some literature was almost as if he was trying to inject himself into the news\n[noise] there

but\nHe's at MSNBC now there were misspellings on the packages there is some dispute\nAlready some debate as to whether the ... these were even opera bull bombs there been several folks with some purported level of expertise who have suggested that these are very crudely constructed bombs\nThere's been some theories that these bombs were never meant to go off that these bombs were intended as an elaborate ploy to garner media attention well that of course that's off around the speculation affair round of speculation may I say as\nTo who would gain from the appearance that a lot of bombs or that bombs were being sent to a lot of prominent Democrats\nUm earlier in the week there was supposedly a bomb placed in the mailbox of George Soros I don't know if these were bombs or not I don't know if these bombs\nWere designed effectively to explode and simply didn't does strike me that at one point it was six I Believe it's more now and the FBI says there are potentially more packages en

made it up it's not mine dish but I Do think it is a good idea to be circumspect the president was giving a speech at the White House earlier today\nAnd the speech was intended to highlight the work that millennia Trump is doing to war what is frequently referred to as the opioid crisis he she and he first addressed\nUm vis a sensible a bomb scare and he said\nHe was what would be called very

them there in an auto accident you name it happens and then you don't get to vote in your vote counts it matters especially your vote\nBecause you're the smart voters and we don't have enough of youth

this is in the greater Houston area\nWent to the Jersey village polling location and about eleven this morning nothing unusual everything went very smoothly I did not vote the straight Republican ticket this time I could not cast my vote for the Alamo destroyer George Bush instead I voted for the libertarian candidate may I suggest you advise the voters to do the same\nWe should not disturbed that hallowed ground\nYeah my problem with telling people to vote anything other than straight\nParty ticket is that it gets lost in the translation so while I think George Bush has done an awful job I Would rather when the seats that matter the most important seats that matter and deal with him in the future so I'm asking people to vote straight Republican\nRamona and I went and cast their votes today and we're very happy to do so\nUm when you say remind was there anything about\nOur voting experience that you would like\nUs to share this for the women in front of us were very attractive I don't know how this happened but we had um one woman in very tight yoga\nPants I mean restricting a circulation sort of tight yoga pants and tennis shoes I'm a very muscular I'm toned should I say I'm probably thirty eight year old black woman\nUm she she wasn't talking to anybody though unfortunately we kept trying to make her eyes and make small talk um the other was the what do you think that role was Hispanic\nWoman that was too in front of us\nYeah um she's very attractive and and for some reason I said something inappropriate that Ramon chest asked me for I noted to him that she had beautiful hands in addition to many of our other features\nAnd he thought that was weird but you know what to each his own\nLisa writes czar I live in Houston I listen to you mostly on the podcast

out they have been able to stay on Saturday So you should go out and\nThat is correct thank you Dave I'm for those of you in Texas anyway I don't want to speak to other states and get it wrong\nIf you need to vote on the weekend um\nYou because for whatever reason you can't get to the polls during the week Saturday is seven eight to Seventy in Harris County anyway I Know that to be true and then

longer to be completely honest [noise]\nUm how long but Fifteen minutes I think it was less than it was ten maybe ten um\nIt was really easy um I always get a lot of emails from folks on these voting machines and you know if you're convinced the voting machines are crooked corrupt wired when that's your business or you know I'm Sorry that I don't devote enough time for you on that\nIt is true that it's tricky little machine\nAnd it is true that you need to go slowly I admit I get a bit of anxiety when it comes to the machine because I Want to make sure that my vote is cash correctly and I suspect others do too because my vote matters I take my vote very seriously it might just be one vote but I take very seriously\nUm my choice as to who is going to fill the seat and serve in a row and I want to make sure that my voice is heard properly so I Do I I go through very slowly and I cast my vote and then I go back where it gives you a chance to review it and I go tedious\nLee line by line by line Ramon you don't because you were waiting outside and you\nKind of rushed through it you're that kid that turns his paper into early and went to the whole thing and then cast my vote and there's a good feeling I stuck my I voted sticker on my forehead today because\nI wanted everybody to know\nAnd I think it's important I don't want to get hokey but I I Do I find it to be a very important Mike Europe\nYeah hey Michael how are you doing good hey let me tell you what I was thinking about\nThis most of the day before I went to vote and I'm telling you I think the whole situation is just a little bit to clean it's almost like it's a part of a psychological operations plan where\nOne of those ... then that thanks so if a caravan didn't work now they try this and you notice that everyone is very prominent and they all ended\nUp they're supposed to target at the same time but what concerns me about all this is this is not effective I I I fear that it might be a democratic operative where they you know knock the prominent people that know about this but\nThink if this is not effective Nancy Pelosi said it a week ago you know some there's going to be some collateral damage I fear somebody's going to get hurt at some point and this is the same party that try to blame then got on a video tape for a while [noise] interesting\nSo do you think it is a democratic operative who's doing this but not for NATO and at the highest levels\nI think that's exactly right I think there's some ... ability to kind of built in\nAnd I think that it's probably somebody who's young and likes to think they're big on strategy but those of us who've lived a long time and I've seen some of these things work\nIt fear I fear that if there's always the next step in the plant that that doesn't work then something else is already lined up and it's just\nTo clean to have these individuals and a twelve days before election day getting these packages all at the same time and I think that if in fact\nIt was I'm not out there it will have in the rap on Monday because the police and the law enforcement people looking at that are really I think they're that good and coming from the military background as myself I really think they're that good but if the if in fact an operative where political\nA game of some sort where no one was ever intended to get hurt I don't think anyone is going to get arrested don't think they'll find out\nDo you think that they would have said and say that last line\nWell I I think that if\nFirst responders and the Alcohol Tobacco and firearms people in the ...
