monster\nA meeting Dr Frankenstein me being the monster him being Dr Frankenstein sounds like you have no idea what you did to my work but I don't mind the fluff yourself you know [laughter] but um [noise]\nAre encountering scared that you know scary stuff in the woods being humans and uh you know there are people I ran into so I told this story once before on the air but it's it's been about two years probably me and my dad back in two thousand and three\nWere uh in northern California\nI'm way up in the south of trinity national forest and just a beautiful country I mean just it's so beautiful up there and we think we have big trees here money's there there's there's a small time stuff the big trees are small time prepared these giant first and red woods up there and we drove through a tree I mean it was it was incredible up there\nAnd so on top of this mountain were doing some call and got my night vision out there and check out this valley\nAnd I'm doing some big foot stuff up there and it was having a great time me and my dad and um some do it in ... where I was at I just thought it was because we're so isolated in the middle of nowhere we didn't have a gun we didn't know you could carry guns in the national forest ... state\nSo here we are in the middle of I don't go anywhere without a gun you know what I mean so like you know we're going and we got we're in the middle of the woods without a gun and I'm like [noise]\nBut I had my night vision on and I'm looking down the valley I mean the valley just right below us I'm like a little wedge probably two hundred and fifty yards below as I see a light beaming up toward us I'm like I said dad is somebody down there\nWere in the middle of knew where like if you go to like if you drove from here to Saratoga okay and there were no houses\nNot one business that's the distance we were from a town of two thousand people that was the big town in the region so a lot from here to Saratoga was not one business not one nothing no dwellings just woods\nSo it's a dad as somebody down there and I and I said I don't see a lie to look into the light beam right now but about couldn't see when they could I put my night vision back on to see the light beam and see some of the movement is oh my God somebody has night vision and the infrared lights because of night vision you can use infrared light you can't see with the naked eye can see with night vision equipment\nAnd I immediately knew this was someone else doing cripples illogical research this is someone 'cause I heard there's a lot of drug trafficking in growing in those words out in that part of the world\nSo I said we've got to get out of here and now we're up some recording devices and stuff like that we even heard that you know they didn't know what we're going to get the NIH but I've been told there are a lot of el ... billing and at that time of year when I get some cool sounds and you didn't know what we're going to really encounter you know so I take all the gear we saw that in a rental cars or H H R and um\nWhen I got the gear and the car run a logging ruin a like a logging trail the intersected a mountain road and the road continue to cross the Trump attended across the road soon as I got in the car light beams about a half mile away on the other side of logging road came on\nSo I clicked to what was going on somebody down below that of radio somebody the other side\nSo we took off and by the time he said when asking if I was not an never smoked in my life so silly hit the road and um we we ... ... ... a big truck came behind this\nAnd I at one point I was going to eighty miles an hour down the mountain I kid you not ongoing eighty miles an hour now in the mountains and there's lanes on the mountain for cars to pass a gotten attorney lane just in case of thousand hurry\nAnd they they were trying to hit us a kid you know they were trying to hit us and uh we got down to the base of the mountain and finally and they we took off one direction I turned off turn back around with up the mountain\nAnd uh contacted the forest service when I got home and just ask about how much is it true about the drug running up there and I was told\nIt was really prevalent I tell them the uh told him the the section of the forest where we're at just just out of curiosity and it's a big reason this product probably at three hundred mile square mile sex and he said that's the worst one and all my costs nice and I said let me ask you a question I plan on coming back next year\nIf I if like if I buy a hunting

woods ranging from dues with potato sacks and their heads are very flashers and um people doing the various activities and be a fun way of talking about a real danger and also even a real danger of like being careful with\nChicks and a ... and stuff because of everything from West Nile to Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the dreaded Lyme disease and all that kind of stuff\nThat's the scary stuff folks that is the very very very very scary\nStuff so I thought it'd be fun but for the next segment\nTo talk about what I think are the scariest movies that take place in outdoors settings or without doors or my favorites at least in this area\nBecause in some funny stuff that happens with animals and some of these movies so I go back to one of the all time greats okay if anyone knows me very long they know I'm a huge fan of bailout will go see me at least they got to go to ... grave in Hollywood\nAnd someone to put black roses on the screen for appropriately Bela Lugosi if you don't know get a clue that was Dracula I mean come on and many other roles my favorite roles actually he's of ego or incentive Frankenstein but\nIn Dracula there and transfer vein you write transfer ... is a is a state in Romania and in the first in the ... epic castle opens up\nAnd their spider webs and there's a bat flying around and there's a possum yes our Virginia possum walks across the floor and
