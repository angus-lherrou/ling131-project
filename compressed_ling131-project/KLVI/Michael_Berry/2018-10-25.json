free Darryl\nIncome rose Europe [noise] Michael\nIn regard to this illegal um alien invasion coming up from Honduras and Mexico ... there was a very effective way with regard to the Mexican government\nAnd it doesn't involve us falling into the trap a bad optics of truth so much to us troops so much is breathing on an illegal immigrant that the mainstream media is already starting their cameras up for\nThe first one is the first idea if the international water and boundaries commission we kick Mexican Government off of it take control of the Rio Grande and threatened to cut off or water\nIt won't cut it won't cause them any immediate arm because it's so wet right now but all those citrus growers on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande will start getting real darn nervous\nThe second idea is a ... which is the Mexico ... in the Mexican nationalized oil company\nI think it's now the other G ... summit but yeah yeah but\nOkay they own a fifty percent stake in that show refinery on the board of Houston\nAnd they bring my and heavy crude up there haven't refined and then show so I'm get refined products so why don't we seize that refined product and put it in the gas tanks of all these vehicles and planes and whatnot it's\nGoing to be used to provide services and deal with their citizens\nDarryl while I appreciate your frustration with the caravan and the seeming unwillingness of our neighbors to the south to handle their own responsibility\nI Am not in favor of seizing assets of foreign or domestic interests that will have a chilling effect\nOn the investment that comes into this country that is that the core of our wealth creation we don't want to get into the business of government seizing assets willy nilly and why are we going to\nSeize assets of financial interests\nOver five to ten thousand migrants on march we'd find ourselves seizing assets\nQuite a bit in fact I'm with Rand Paul on the issue that we need to stop seizing so many things\nWe confiscate people's money we we take their funds on the basis that they're supposedly in drug deals are in the cartel or a terrorist or whatever else they're all sorts of Americans innocently having their cash seized at airports or various checkpoints throughout this country that they never get back\nSo no I won't be for that this is not very difficult for every one of you who has been a parent or who once had one you've probably used the following line you can do what you want when you're out on your own but as long as you're living under my roof\nAnd I'm paying your bills then you're not going to fill in the blank\nSo very simple concept every parent has used it and every one of us as a young person hurt our parents tell us that you don't get to do what you want to do as long as the parent is paying the bills and you're living under the that roof\nTrump very cleverly said the Guatemalans if you don't stop these Hondurans from coming up here\nAnd we're going to simply freeze the one point six billion dollars you receive that's not so difficult you could do that to Mexico you could do that to Guatemala you could do it the Honduras this is not a problem that should require the United states military now may eventually because the crap\nRolls downhill this is not a problem that we should have to be calling in to talk radio with clever ways to deal with it should not require\nNational Guard troops military troops are the seizure of assets\nIt's a problem that other governments need to solve and if they can't solve it we should use our diplomatic ties there's a reason we have embassies there's a reason we spend so much on a State Department there is a region reason we expend so many\nThere's so much of our resources maintaining diplomatic ties\nThe flow of funds from the United states in two countries for humanitarian aid and commercial interests sustains those countries they can't survive without us\nYou simply freeze that for a brief period of time and it won't take long until the Guatemalans\nHave to get down to the dirty business of dealing with a mass of people it's unpleasant the Mexicans don't want to do it the Guatemalans don't want to do it the Hondurans don't want to do it there are clearly outside interests imagine if you would somewhere between five and ten thousand people pumping\nJust think about that I'm not being sillier funnier or try to\nThink about this for a moment it's not a cheeky comment necessarily ten thousand people taking a dump anywhere imagine what a public health hazard that is\nThe reality is many of these people are carrying disease some of that airborne on the ah by flies on the top of poop\nHell you can't find a place for ten thousand people to take a dump at an outdoor festival how's that
