going back into hurricane damage and stuff um [noise] one of the things that happen with a hurricane to hit last fall was water the water gets sucked out of some of these days when one cycle the wind comes inside manatees will get stranded\nAnd uh we I wrote a blog about this moron who posted this fantasy of killing a manatee\nWhen that happened and uh that guy's probably still out there somewhere in his grandma's basements I'm In er and he never comes out in public ... you can't see probably can't identify this guy's probably never been in public in life but he has somehow he got ... down there\nAnd he's down in in in this in his basement and he's sending out all his raging hate\nBecause obviously this guys you know\nA isn't married or anything and he is very bitter about life and he's seen a manatee for some reason he said I got to kill that\nWe've got to kill that we just got killed that day or this guy is like the dude on deliverance you know the ... the one that got a whole ... one of the two it's that you can't have a normal people don't know what was that still kill a manatee but sometimes catastrophes bring the worst out of people\nSo looking back at the storm thing there's one ... and this has always been fascinating\nIs one aspect of storms that is a positive and nature and that is red fish production so red fish in the fall\nRed fish I'm coming to the beach is
