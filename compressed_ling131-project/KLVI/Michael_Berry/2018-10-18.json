arrested earlier this year for assaulting another woman interior secretary Ryan Zinke he's press secretary Heather swift after a budget hearing before a house committee\nAdam ... who is the public and gubernatorial candidate his spokesman Parker bride and set according to Fox News assaulting the female campaign manager of the is opposing campaign is disgusting and has no place in our system this mob behavior from the left is out of control\nEncouraging violence as many prominent Democrats like former attorney general Eric Holder have recently done it's having real dangerous consequences\nStark has since been fired from the Democratic group that was\n[noise] employing him\nThis thing continues the Democrats continue is your article today I don't remember who published it and it was about how therapists are reporting\nShe doesn't crack forty percent\nReal clear politics average ... thirty eight point three to daily ... twenty four point seven\nA whole lot of Californians who have not made up their minds and probably won't until election day\nSo that means that only about sixty two sixty three sixty four percent less than two thirds fewer than two thirds of Californians have made up their minds\nI Will tell you Twenty years in politics and reading polls\nIncumbents tend to peak\nIn the early polls because their name id is that close to a hundred percent everybody knows who they are\nIf you see an incumbent in an early poll with high name id Ninety percent or above\nBut doesn't approach high numbers in terms of percentage of votes they're winning that is a signal that a credible candidate can potentially beat them\nWith Feinstein she's widely known she's been the senator of California for four hundred years so they know who she is\nAnd yet they're not saying they're going to vote for her\nNow they're not saying they're going to vote for her opposition either and he's a Democrat bar more liberal than she is but if they're not willing to commit to her it means they are willing to consider an alternative\nAnd that's a third of the voters who are willing to consider an alternative so if you got thirty six percent still out there floating\nAnd you're at twenty five percent you got to win twenty five out of thirty six which means you gotta you gotta win two thirds of the remaining voters\nBut it's possible it's not crazy because they're not with are already\nThe polling was not even on likely voters it was on adults and registered voters survey usa interviewed twelve hundred California adults from friday through

that fight she wasn't in the Kavanaugh fight her heart wasn't in it but she had to be if she wanted that cabin I'll Fight she would have started to fight earlier\nShe would have been more strategic about it now I suppose you could say well\nBy waiting till the very end she got the most bang for the buck most folks are suggesting that she's not the one who actually made it public\nAnd I'm not convinced she necessarily wanted to make it public I think she had a pretty good sense that it might be a loser of an issue she was boxed into a corner\nDamned if she didn't damned if she didn't\nBecause if she doesn't bring the Ford allegation forward when it showed up on her doorstep she was the one who\nFound out about it then she catches heat\nBecause you sat on this you could have protected this woman who's a victim\nBut if she does bring it forward which in effect as what happened\nNow it's hung around her neck she made a clown of herself she big clown her so she ended up looking like a fool\nNo I don't know California the fruits and nuts that are California Democrats I don't know in their minds if she came off looking better or worse for what she did 'cause I don't know how the I don't understand how these people think but\nOut of twelve hundred adults that were poll from friday through Sunday nine hundred and sixty four of them were registered to vote seven
