E. X. eleven Ninety out of Portland, Oregon who live in Washington state your last day to register was yesterday your rule is twenty two days\nBefore the election but you can vote in person until October twenty nine I'm not actually sure how that works\nUm I was going through in looking at the various dates of registration and I saw that\nSo for our state of Washington residence\nUm because that is unclear to me if you are not yet registered or your registration may have lapsed\nChecked that on line there will be resources to each of you depending on your state's I'm as to when exactly you can vote spent some time on that don't just ask somebody I often get asked questions in passing on the last day to register\nAnd there are often um some technicalities\nThat go into that we will begin early voting before what I typically referred to as election day and I encourage you to early vote it's always easier there are typically more places for you to vote early\nThere is a shorter line than on election day and then if you get posted out of town or out of out of the country or you're sick or a relative or is is sick or it's raining terribly or for whatever reason then you don't miss the opportunity to vote so I'll give you early voting days as we get a little\nBit closer of because I Would really like to see Republicans hold the house the Senate when some governor's races and we

trial going to go home and going to reverse the economy going to kind of stay on the water [noise]\nWell [noise] that's a complicated question\nI think that the single most important aspect of the Trump presidency will say return in investor confidence and I returned to consumer confidence\nThe problem is with the quantitative easing that during the Obama years and this actually goes back to the months just before the Obama president that the Obama inauguration\nThe fed pumps so much money into the economy and there was a period of time there that banks were basically getting free money\nIn order to to bolster the banks you were giving the banks free money\nTo then go out and Lynn what can you imagine it [laughter]\nIf if I told you to open a a burger joint and I came in and brought you all the supplies and and everything and covered your labor and all you had to do is sell the burgers I think most everybody could succeed in that market\nAnd so that's what happened the problem is once you open that spigot nobody wants to close it off so you had an artificially depressed\nInterest rates that Trump was Trump was ... I mean the Obama was getting the benefit of\nSo even though the Trump academy is better than the Obama economy was\nIt's an artificial comparison because what's happening now as you're watching these are the the these um um interest rates start to creep back up\nAnd first of all you don't want that to happen before the election and that starts to scare people the cost of borrowing money which means the cost of research and development\nThe cost of opening new locations the cost of investing in capital those sorts of things increase which slows that economic activity now for some reason\nAmericans have not been as willing to reward Trump for the economy that he ushered in as they should be\nI think that's probably partly due to this very divisive media strategy I think it's it's partly due to a very aggressive ah anti Trump movement and so he's not getting the bump that I think you you probably should have\nExpected him to get I mean look we're seeing historic numbers\nUnemployment claims down first time unemployment claims down which means layoffs or reduce the number of people are seeking work they can't find it or or down expansion in in the job force the stock market hitting historic highs\nI think the stock market has now hit a hundred highs record highs during his presidency\nNow think about that that's like hitting a a a four hundred foot homerun or five hundred foot home run it's not just that you hit a home run the next day in order to out do that you got to hit five oh five and then five ten and then five Fifteen and this economy has done that\nSo people have had this overnight increase in in wealth\nAnd that is due to a stock market that's up that I think reflects a lot of aspects\nThat Trump is responsible for a president can ever claim all the success or failure of the stock market during their president say there's no doubt\nAnd he was trying to encourage young black students at this mostly\nNot solely or exclusively but mostly black university trying to encourage them to vote\nAnd he said quote don't let these old white people decide our lives for us\n\nHe said don't let these old white people decide our lives for us\nTed Cruz's forty seven ... forty six they're basically the same age Beto O'Rourke really Robert Francis O'Rourke which was how he was known when he left Texas and wasn't running for office and he was at Columbia University\nWhen he wrote that review referring to women bother anatomical parts for which he had to apologize last week so Robert Francis O'Rourke who is white is the candidate

encourage you to go to Michael berry dot com and see this for yourself\nYou can't believe this is happening in the United states but it is and it's happening in downtown Portland where the mayor Ted Wheeler continues to ... to a post tweets about joining with other mayors over renewable forests\nAnd energy and third world countries and recycling\nWhile his city has been taken over\nLittle life at

Missouri when when when towns are taken over\nThe business owners board up and sleep well that's what this antifa has done it's the Occupy movement to point out that that that this is the group we're talking about the same types of groups and they're carrying sticks and clubs\nAnd they're standing at the intersections and ask cars unsuspecting drivers drive up they roll their windows down like what do I do you've you've blocked the street what the and they tell them where to go you get outta here you go over there but that's but you know the ways or the the Google Maps just telling me to go
