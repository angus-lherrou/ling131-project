now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with mental that\nThat's funny say that they do you hear the other panelists the white panelist laughing 'cause black person just attacked a black person Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read that's what he said\nWell that's nice isn't it say\nThey won't have a white person said that they'll have the black person say that and that's what blacks to that silk crab in a bucket [noise] if you don't know what the crab in a bucket theory is or phenomena it's not just a theory it's a phenomenon\nBecause it's a fact it happens\nBlack people know what it is because black people who witnessed the crime in a bucket phenomena is that black people are like crabs in a bucket\nIf one of them starts climbing to where he is getting to the edge of the bucket to get hold of it and get out the other crabs beneath him will grab him with their pinchers pull him back down\nSo you know a Isaac Newton famously said if I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants\nAre no Ramon not one set of footprints let me promote pleased about interest when I'm trying to uh say smart stuff\nIsaac Newton was referencing the fact that\nScience builds on what comes before it everything is in one way or another derivative of what happens before it and that's what Newton was recognizing\nAnd whether it's Kanye West or Jay Z or anybody else we're products of the art if we're artists that came before us if we're scientists we're products of the science that came before us\nScientists today don't have to devote their careers to figuring out Archimedes principle\nThey don't need to spend their time understanding gravity and gravitational pull pi has already been established\nThey have a scientific method a rigorous means by which things are tested the global warming crowd out to try this\nAnd so you start having all these things already I mean if you're a writer you start with the fact that language has already been established the use of language to language turns of language turns of phrase\nAll of these things but there is in black pop culture\nThere is the inability to add to what was before because of the tearing down so many black artists have to spend their time re establishing their bona fides and there's a reason for that\nAnd if you want to use slave analogies here's where you can use them here's where you get into references of house negroes here's where you get into references that I Do think go back a long time\nThey go back over ... over a century ago\nCentury and a half some cases more this idea\nOf a black man daring to have an opinion outside that of other black people\nAnd the reason is because if blacks stark having their own opinions\nThan the white liberals won't be able to count on a hundred percent of them and the white liberals have built their coalition\nOn needing disarmed me and when the army desserts\nSee that's why that's why they they put somebody behind the army and shoot the disorder\nAnd that's why you would spare three men per hundred to shoot the disorders because if one starts peeling off it will encourage the others and before you know it you've lost all hundred of your infantry\nWell that's the way it is with blacks and that's why the white liberals are very careful do let black folks think for themselves if black folks start thinking independently look I don't expect a hundred percent of black people to vote Republican\nBut you can't tell me it's healthy for a hundred or Ninety nine percent of blacks to vote Democrat you can't tell me that wouldn't be anybody black that would like Donald Trump and I guess that would be okay if they weren't popular in pop culture and ... has been so here CNN's pale\nTell you what is what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to

Sally the Republican there something of a bad assed veteran from what I understand has erased\nAll of care students to name as early lead in the race to replace Jeff Flake and this is not McCain's seat this is Jeff lakes seat remember the governor there put the former Republican senator in that seat for now\nFlake fortunately is retiring flake voted against Kavanaugh I'll remind you mix Sally is now up she was she was a losing\nShe's now up forty seven forty one and the Green Party candidate angel agree that's convenient has four percent\nWhat's interesting there is I think a couple of things happening that's a Republican state there's no doubt\nArizona's a Republican state has been since long before Goldwater consistently\nYou have some pockets of Democrats you had a Hispanic Democrat who was plum crazy you had Gabby Giffords who was a Democrat in a purple district but at the time\nShe was a pro gun rights Democrat and she was a little more conservative on some of the social issues and so she was able as a Democrat popular Democrat to win in what was really a Republican district and I believe it is Republican now\nSo but the state is a Republican state no doubt about that\nMuch Sally was in an ugly ugly three person primary race and I think there were some hard feelings there\nI think that some of what we experienced in for instance Alabama where he had kind of a Tea Party candidate kind of a constitutional is Canada national a nationalist nationalist populist candidate\nAnd then you get more sort of a traditional Republican Party establishment guy you get these bruising primaries and we're not done with this this has been going on with we've really seen is a lot going back all the way the two thousand ten in Republican primaries and the question is can you get\nCan you get your folks to come back out in November behind the candidate who beat your candidate in the primary\nAnd it might not be that they vote for the other side they just don't vote for the person who beat their candidate in the primary that's where these bruising primaries are so tough there so so tough\nWe saw that in Alabama Doug Jones should've never won 'em up and Roy Moore had his problems as as a candidate and you you you drove a lot of people away and then by the end Roy Moore was a guy that a lot of Republicans didn't want in their\nDemocrats would suffer I mean look at look at what um Nader did to\nAl Gore but for Ralph Nader running in two thousand Al Gore would have one that we wouldn't have ... you wouldn't\nHave known to the secretary of state was in Florida there would have been no hanging chads that races over\nLet's turn to Tennessee my my prediction at this point unless something dramatic changes my prediction at this point is\nThat Arizona goes to Martha McSally\nThat a Republican holes that seat which would be important\nThe national folks are are are weighing in and helping where they can mix Sally plays nice with the establishment so she's not a candidate that the establishment is going to turn on kicker out of the boat so my guess is they pour some resources in their toward the end they really focused on her military record which is impressive\nUm they focus on keeping that seat Republican and she's a woman if it were she were a man that she could be hit by a woman as you know we need another woman in the Senate but she's\nNot so if if I were to say right now I think Arizona holes that seat Republican Tennessee has been an interesting seat during all of this Marsha\nBlackburn the congressman appears to have pulled out in front I I don't know how you pronounce this guy's name breeds and I see it written but I don't I don't know how you breathe a son or breeds and B. R. E. D. E. S. E. him it doesn't matter\nBecause Martha Marsha Blackburn is going to win that\nRight now a Fox News or let's say a New York times had a live poll the New York times is doing this deal where they're calling people and as the calls come in they're posting them which is an interesting kind of a real time it's almost like when Frank Luntz\nDoes the the ah the the surveys where they have you know six or eight or ten or twenty people and and they have the meters\nAnd as they vote you get to see you know like you get to watch them watch debate and see what they like and don't why well there's things pretty neat what what New York times is doing I just don't trust the New York times but they've got um\nThey've got Blackburn with a ... point lead\nUm they've\nGot her with a with a sorry an Eighteen percentage point lead fifty seven thirty nine Tennessee is a red state it's a Republican state this is Bob Corker seat\nTennessee has been cursed with to squish\nRepublicans Corker and the ... Alexander and I think Tennessee is a more conservative state than the senators they've had they've\nHad Jeff Flake style senators and I think the state is much more conservative than that I just do once\nYou get outside of Nashville I don't think Nashville itself is is terribly conservative as most big cities art and it's a big city full of artist so I think you've got a bunch of\nYou've got a bunch of granola conservative types skinny jeans wearing a liberal folks who liked to act like their country but they're actually Austin, Texas or San Francisco liberals anyway I think Marsha Blackburn wins that\nThe national media has fallen for the issue that that uh\nTaylor Swift has broken her silence on politics and she's done what the mob demanded she's gone with a Democrat interestingly a Democrat who in two thousand five had some serious sexual harassment allegations in his office\nAnd she did this just after the Kavanaugh hearings so that that's kind of an odd choice and by the way the guy she went for said he would have voted yes for Kavanaugh because he sees riding on the wall he's looking at the same polling number we are except he's looking at a lot more polling numbers\nRemember these guys have a lot more polling data up to date sooner than you do so by the time you\nThe poll that says hey Heidi Heitkamp losing in North Carolina I mean in in North Dakota\nHeidi Heitkamp the Democrat incumbent is losing in North Dakota and the people of North Dakota want Kavanaugh by the time you see it she's had it for days she's had time to change her opinion or change our public positions\nNever forget how much polling data these people have access to in real time they pay people a lot of money to do focus groups and see where they should come down on these issues\nAnd they don't make a statement on it before that and I'll tell you this I'm Glad Susan Collins when with with a Kevin all but I guarantee you Susan Collins was looking at polling data\nThat showed that the people in her state one cabinet\nThat doesn't minimize how difficult it was for her as a woman\nTo come out in favor of him especially when she was targeted so heavily\nBut\nIt does mean that the support is there and and they can talk about Susan Rice running against or they can run Taylor Swift or Susan Rice\nOr a Lena Dunham or whoever else they want to drag out\nThe fact is the fact\nIs Susan Collins is popular in Maine Susan Collins voted with the conservatives and the state of Maine has a fierce streak of independence and they don't like to be bullied by\nOther folks so when Susan Collins comes out and says they tried to illegally bribe me\nWhen stories appear about them sending three thousand coat hangers to her when she has to take back alley entrances to get into the Capitol when she talks about how awful it is banned and she's been intimidated and threatened\nMaybe Susan Collins is paying people to do that because you are absolutely\nPositively ensuring that she's going to be reelected I'm kidding she's not she's not a paying people to do that but she is having to put up with help from the left and if they think they're going to bully this woman into ... she's no she doesn't sit down when she pays like Jeff Flake does she's not going to be intimidated [noise]\nAnd she's going to be reelected in twenty twenty
