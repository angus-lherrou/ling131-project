the site that his death took seven minutes runs a physician doctor Salah Muhammad al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though\nThe kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as my palm pale met Wednesday after being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air do on and the Turkish foreign minister\nAfter ... rubber arriving from

said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nHop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged

recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception ... who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British

don't understand is if you don't threaten to pull out of a deal\nAnd you don't threatened tariffs you're never gonna get the deal and nobody ever thought in the past ... asked for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across the country doing better and that that's what brings us to this election\nAnd I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from the Democratic party that's going to improve the lives of Americans make us more prosperous or secure I don't care about I Want I Want this country to be with us for us\nHe also did something that the mainstream media is not reporting on the twenty fifth of July the declaration of a cease fire in Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to\nPressure on China from Europe he's affective Lee and people are really reporting is pretty ... joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and he's treated ... grievances with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show ... owned by me back I think you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive so that would tell me by now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're\nBanging on his door begging that they can get those back\nDon't question yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and uh we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're\nJust to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled uh it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it done shortly thereafter\nAh because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very core of but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government are and what is best for the American working family so\nAh and that's why it was all ... and by the way you know I was ... doing a lot of traveling around the country I was in

that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage you mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position I did what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for all of us don't talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that literate that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now\nThis is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri\nAnd one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding hiding and masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking constituency in Missouri the\nDemocratic Party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri are kind of see you basically have to mislead voters elected a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our law is you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute capital was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then went all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you've got these anarchists middle class of managers attacking to Minnesota GOP

McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable and they play loaded on your show last night and she said the number that quoted she says well it started

never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away\nFrom candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV [noise] Shaun Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud will will walk by what were courting the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own their own their own or it's not\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it is is a direct quote for staffers next a roast about how she's going to impeach ... can tell the moderates to get over it\nAfter she gets elected ... words and she's calling me a frog stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting to expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get\nAll of this out than before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you now what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you
