Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handled Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing the president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the Gulf great\nSo that's why it or don't told Trump to bring these guys and I should have known I should've known Geraldo told Trump to get Kanye West in there and Joe Brown\nAnd tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know that Geraldo did bring up a or something I forgot it\nWas Kanye West who told George W.

James O'Keefe is going to join us and the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there\nHim and his campaign and his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency but the very purpose of getting elected and they say it's not once but\nThey say over and over and over and over again I don't play a few later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero truth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh where do we get to the tape on cinema today or\nYou know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but go when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer the first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time\nBecause that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nRepublicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs up post chops and never come back well in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what ... what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nWhen they tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation\nOf the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that has created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what ... was saying and I'm like why do we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of Alice marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense a grandmother apparently she'd running a horrible economic difficulties like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal just\nThe system anyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the hours Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nAlso talked about the neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only\nBecause the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program it just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be\nAnd you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night and not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done at this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human\nOur human family in telling her being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America you know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed\nAnd we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time\nAnd somehow in this era of political correctness it's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and a noxious vicious viral thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when negroes don't read flat phone turns out to train tiny west and the racial draft now all of a sudden ... because he put on a mat hats and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro of the of the Trump administration's\n... was an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you had there a man who's clearly not okay to president who's willing to point that was a combination of stream of consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health on the question of other pointing ham I felt very good point and to me\nI never something very fragile about ... and sad about tiny pulling out of the phone and translate Taipei in his country outside I think for their own some somewhere picture of a ... I mean just to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television make at that but I Can't think of all I heard\nA thoughtful play by play and political and now you're not thinking is that with his ... on our life\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually for bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\n[laughter] this is white supremacy by ring true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most of the various practices and yet of black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been ... by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and viable I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable to anybody this I don't know Kanye except I talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd he is a pack on that vicious horrible level\nI don't even know what to say my friend Heisman Trophy winning football great Herschel Walker\nHe's called out CNN Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West than he questions is on their behavior and as a guest or a referring to was quote the oh leave all want to repeat what you just heard\nTelling him well you may not want to get involved in this of Republicans lose they're gonna blame you blah blah blah\nThat that's just not how he rose to ... if we if you fight hard and you give something you're all and you don't win at least you can look in the mirror and say you did everything you could do because there's a lot at stake that's not going to\nBe the end of the world of the Democrats where it's just going to make every thing harder and more divisive and more difficult and it's going to waste our time and slow or progress\nI that that's really the truth and it's important that we keep the momentum are you're better off than you or two years ago are you a safer more secure is the economy better off on every measure we know the answer to it\nBut watching Democrats unhinged is pretty amazing right we've got tapes on yes read as soon as running in ah Tennessee and cinema in Arizona will play those next [noise]\n\nThe Greer [noise]\nShoes I'm rich Dennison American pastor Andrew

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you know just the market went down ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they wouldn't want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations and what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the ... on also Joe Donnelly is now down right in writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nIf you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfavorable among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nTo these house races you're talking about\nMost of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house\nBut I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite as far\nAnd I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it yeah I Do\nI think they're really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I Would kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York\nUh I've noticed which is a pretty hard core left wing state even a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat problem is not me in the end of it stems cells are streaming shows but those are\nMade it to me that there are actually are conservative state certainly noticed that it's not it's\nSimple no one Hans within a fast life oh no I'm\nA I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be governor governor the you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo I Am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice you have it like to run for it\nI think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug I'm very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kit for Franklin square you're still you're still am when you're working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax they have jobs but by the way it Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg read or heard it oh yeah\nYeah I I I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him 'cause he's moving so far left chat it's unbelievable he's gotta get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as John says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice for a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back where the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world\nAre we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you\nDo oh I Want democratic candidates at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal rights is absolutely going to shouldn't go period and start\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times are good on the radio as you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time what should it be it should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nWell I think it's got to be not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years\nIf you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if you believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh over all of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nLike that probably less than half of my junior my junior senior year I was tending bar till four thirty in the morning a
