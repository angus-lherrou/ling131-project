near the first time I know we have three more minutes long way to go oh this is exciting ...\nOr you know and not to be negative or anything about it is what it is is that a tough time on third down conversion tonight or this afternoon them uses they won for eight hours down convergence filled the defense is doing its\nJob they're doing a really good job you know one in eight on conversions that's incredible uh\nI think than his and you know you're on the same you since I'm On right now the only chance you have and making posts even which is their expectation you know every year you know being a big Sam Houston you know pretty much the golden Jim conference for football limit in east then I mean I wasn't going to saving nice 'cause\nYou're a little more you're more hours on that one or you don't like the network yeah there's not going to\nSay that but you know isn't there can be some frustration on the dime on right now and then you know that's cancerous that's spread it is and ah you know we can start seeing and make it from the stakes get nervous 'cause they're kind of plan on staying on Mars playing with the wind at their back right they have nothing to lose\nMove forward with regard to the football program and you can hang on here you up on a bus or for that five Seventy or to get a long way to go and he started getting that long way to go right now is you get the football we are set to go to the second half year old man Cal Gillum with us probe will suffer\nStadium that black conference football on the campus is a little more university\nRe costing the kick it off or Sam Houston state\nHere's your approach and the ... this is going to be fielded asked the goal line by his age aisles brings a lot of the ten Fifteen and it'll be hit pretty hard all around the Eighteen yard line kind of a little indecisive ... there was a when he caught that football at the goal line he might\nHave thought about down in it but he didn't really know where he was on the field I think yeah I was you know that situation especially you know going into the when it's a tight\nGame [noise] you don't want to take any chances in law especially with the new rule where you can you know inside the five yard line\nAnd one thing about it as we like looking ahead of the ... the winters are back in the fourth quarter and a good thing first album are from their own a Seventeen yard line to\nWant to carry another big run out over the twenty twenty four yard line making a big big tackle their they have used in state unit in there for the better cats linebacker hunter brown if not boy models is often running\nYeah Sam Hayes in their front you know they're starting to run some non now is I'm back is getting closer to the scrimmage trying to account for that run game AJ Walker now to cure easier right at the line of scrimmage at the twenty five you bring up a third down and three for Lamar hurdles runs that hurry up off in\nShorts Jackson as a tide in coming into the receivers Isaiah Howard rough and leaves the field and used them early voting off the box\nAnd they are third third down guys in the box and read all the cardinals here comes\nDarryl covert pitches it good pitch on the opposite out over the forty yard line goes Kirkland bank for all of our first down\nAt the option may have been really seen too much in the first that and I ran really effectively thereby covert with a a good light pitch you know and and then use it didn't have anybody could have been man [noise]\nGood game\nAs a forty two yard line first down Lamar just started a third quarter cardinal leaf seventeenth or seen\nWanda there was a fake the ones that hit the tide and maintenance like now the New York I mean he said hold down by the top of the helmet at about ... thirty one yard line\nAt a time when you said earlier you know when you're running the ball that opens up a play action and that's exactly what they did a good route ran by Mason sites really discuss it well\nGotta barricade down on the near side line and that yours is actually right there\nYou you run run run run run run that little play action there are we are tied in wide open yeah hit them back to\nThat was a really good flight I coach God and I think he's really got this and he's in a defense on their hills I guess it's good play called solvency nice Daniel Adams a junior from Jasper high

[noise] is it I mean it's a glorified bar fight at Tom\nThirteen minutes twenty six seconds ago here in the third quarter was the Lamar and uses the you know Mars course here hey that's a big position lead you know\nAs as something that they really really need is a buffer going into the fourth quarter is you know eventually you know the banks are going to get made on either side of the fall\nOr you know you want to have a ... on the scoreboard to you know as a safety net [noise] and the interest of 'em\nAre does here uh hopefully they run the ball you know\nLike they have many you know he all security now that is a big thing when you're getting down and read them all security ... when he runs the ball gets gets me nervous sometime gets the job done no yeah more often than not only thirty one yard line first down Lamar Thirteen Fifteen to go into the third quarter\nCan I add it up a mild one of the right to tackle inside the twenty down near sideline tripped up inside the fourteen yard line and is hitting the line of scrimmage it full ... got to flag down and\nOut about the eight yard line in the far side players\nShoveling one another or are they are how are the victim or against
