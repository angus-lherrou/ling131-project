Fox News sources telling Fox the FBI's supplemental report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is expected to be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as today\nAnd you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation\nYou know what I Want to get into what this whole means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is\nThat obviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption\nOf innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger\nCountry\nAnd I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nOr tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and\nWell he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate I Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions\nThey're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that\nThey in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned for witnesses and for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this\nWas enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and\nYou know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in you know that we learned about Mr ... mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor\nSorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking\nFormer yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and\nOn top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided\nRather quickly that that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties\nBut as you said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys in these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person a backup or story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news and yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in Brett Kavanaugh I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls\nOn a nearly weekend basis\nLining up in the halls to gang raped women young girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nIt's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nHe Felice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight why he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nThey need and has the Haitian because there\nA lot of allegations and I mean for its really are about how he behaves bringing in drug\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor\nAccusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination former boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the poured\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voice any fear of flying even\nAll aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look these are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said there were four people that could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story\nMost don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen\nSo at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nIf they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people\nTaking a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I I mean professor Ford has now told their story multiple times and\nI got to believe and assume that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise]\nUm you know it's just I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that mattered\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves\nAnd we'll see what happens in

Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means but I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when

mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins an end flake or or Murkowski in like once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah I mean

sudden you're accusing somebody\nOf something and it gets printed by the New Yorker and the New York times of all places well they spend an entire week calling dozens of people and they learn that the accuser is calling former classmates asking them if they remembered what happened because the accuser saying to them well she's not really sure what happened\nThen you got the whole well they were putting drugs and they were drug in girls almost on a weekend basis I went to Penn of these parties myself\nAnd and he's one of them and and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were

standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top and the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases no corroboration\nNot the case of professor poured not the case of Mr Ramirez and not in the case of June\nLee sweating it know co-op corroboration\nJoe diGenova Victoria Toensing a with us the gentleman Toensing welcome both have you back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all those\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rapes somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody that's that's what the media's going with John I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nOr the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers to help you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a wild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what\nWe didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then did not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris I'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating neck in particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we\nHave now examined every single case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview but they are today anyway the\nEyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\nWell I think um what has to happen who's truly sweat Nick\nIs that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate\nIt has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee and the confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that this ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiated for her story there is no substitute education permits Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied them like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told or if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I ... there was genuine surprise that remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes\nTogether a\nRadical left wing activist a resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats Deborah cats by the way who said well Paula Jones only spent ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I ... I saw a genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice of you if you offered that I didn't know I mean we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules\nI I'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something\nThat really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says occurred and if she had gone to those people\nWhat they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe\nYou know because we're talking about we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now push this so far\nInto a ... ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning I I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react\nI Would assume was probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made\nStory corroborate rubble is non existent shot us in happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys and it just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next\nAnd then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean hey listen if you have sunspots
