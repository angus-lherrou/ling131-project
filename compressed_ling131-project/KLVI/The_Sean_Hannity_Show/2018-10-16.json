although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans are

sign you're basically our governor saying\nOr legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is tax that Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction what\nPeople want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nYet and I agree with you and they had on counted on the way the thinking gotta get out of California can't afford to pay taxes and the ... yeah\nI mean it's unbelievable look I why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey\nAnd Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going

Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll the only state I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response next to hurricanes now remember that that have hit there in the last year where where Scott has really showing the if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's for Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama 'cause remember Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama in two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager [noise]\nAh for Mr Obama at that time and he said yesterday is and why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with our DNA\nNow he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say and many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nAround her and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand doesn't twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is but her she literally personally changed\nHerself to minority status when the U. Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate\nThis is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren really reveals proof of Native American\nAncestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that\nSo yeah sure him to see who the Democrats settle on ... and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project very pause tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times or obtained a copy of it and Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below four percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings\nThat was that was reporter by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible when you're Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with Kavanaugh as well even the CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive\nHey that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great again or keep\nAmerica great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like it didn't two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground than anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but you know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making the recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her uh if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state taxes red state tendency red standing\nBy the way that he rep I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember ... better or got more money than any count my gosh they're eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know I I think they'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans in Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... of unseated cruise but\nFair and balanced and and he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break right back your calls on the other side of big Hannity tonight tell you about that in the minute including pastor Brunson is going to speak out his first cable interview tonight at nine what it was like in prison in Turkey and much more [noise]\n\nCardinal nation largely son Sam Houston said this Saturday at three PM season sponsored market basket NBA assets without federal clinical plus our sponsors credit union rally feel offer\nTwin Peaks universal quaint and boy you can reach us wherever we know how the cardinals tackled a bear cats from Sam Houston the officers repair this Saturday use our our video app on your phone during the game the entire cargo season is brought to you all your fans it's five sixty eight jailed vi\nMonsoon dynasty Rapaport hurricane Michael now blamed for sixteen deaths in Florida Fox's Mike Tobin reporting from the hard hit town of Mexico beach police\nShe was working off a list of people on accounted for and as of yesterday said there was only one person on accounted for well today they found a body sadly a ... and the police was pending notification getting ready to say that the list of those on account for was exhausted Michael\nMade landfall as a category for storm killing at least twenty six people in four states Wall Street rebounding from last week's big sell off\nAnd address and Dr phil average five hundred and forty seven points of twenty five thousand set and I ...
