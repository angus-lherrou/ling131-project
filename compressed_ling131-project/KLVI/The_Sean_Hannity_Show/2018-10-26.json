kill jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach the president so\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop pull a few of the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in in Virginia ten were barber concerts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point\nThat had all the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in the center of ... I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolute ... so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows he'd become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nJust split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house I think of the committees that are going to change\n[noise] think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera\nGuess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll\nGo check his taxes the leak all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters\nWe get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house that that is correct time could jak thing ... whenever they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nI think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret it's not so much Donald Trump that is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races the negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition\nIn a district John absolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical ... sets of Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to them but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC as putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I
