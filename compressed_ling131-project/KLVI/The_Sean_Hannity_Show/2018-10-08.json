changed her story well Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a whole maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say a these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding Dr Ford there were nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there was so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses\nAnd but I think some of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil cases are good men was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep I can that if a top ranking FBI official word a confirmed that\nThere was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to\nGo after Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean reg ...\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russian hoax and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean

trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some of the keys documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the appointment of Robert Mueller as this\nSpecial counsel and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually prove a I think that can be a lot of life can be shutdown that gift the documents would've been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday and this week\nWe're going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the roof or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow do getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere ... there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you\nYou've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work\nBrought you that you often would be the brief by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yeah I've been by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they liked you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy to share\nInsights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime at and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that ... does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare\nEverything that the Russians did versus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the end see ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a Rome people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at that I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd listen first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... ...\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at\nThe time ... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception what are they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged\nRight ... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back I Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you\nKnow using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some recourse for you\nWell I'd definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that\nYou should write a book what it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ... I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you ... do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and I'm going back many years again\nAnd we had talked about how many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spend total over the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean\nIn terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of document production etcetera right now that's a whole different level\nWhen you went before a mall or what was
