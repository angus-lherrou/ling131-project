New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning and the things that he's saying because\nWhile the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people in quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but it'll be ages no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that\nBut for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them there's what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nNow I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI\nI don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and McKay been struck and page but the FBI is is ... ... people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and you just it's dumb to ever talked to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look in his company's coming and low right now is just to try to destroy the Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate\nAs their with their debts get it it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of\nWhat the FBI guys to say that that that somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the St Louis to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI can't and ... how much they kept force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of the old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that there there's like protection\nUnder that morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even sure it was him she said what positive he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands but if that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her\nI I I mean ... even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what go for the FBI can talk to her\nUm they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly getting a whole new wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those three oh two we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said in those conversations are Carrie Severino is where those chief counsel policy director\nJudicial Crisis network thank you for being with us carry we appreciate your time we're in Washington DC

give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the pork and corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um

supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar and so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to take away\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you'd dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do a there your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into\nOther allegations but it'd be a fall one vote short you up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh we legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump has tried they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\n... for its plans are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope\nIt would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that that will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of them doing it right now uh so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher it's about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive so I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but\nI think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can\nI find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota sport Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo to being a party line vote with Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nI think ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made a gun and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about cabinet\nBut they have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you run for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage it has to homophobic Xena fold Islamophobia\nYou're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children and it's got to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff [laughter] it is as predictable as the day is long and now with Supreme Court nominees\nThis slander has been taken to a whole new level do you have a nice throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\nYeah she earns even then it becomes your coffee to the market basket to some of these\nThings and one or the independent voices southeast Texas\nHaitian listening to count vi on Google to say playing these top five sixty kale vi on ... radio [noise]\nHard as we continue with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as we continue also from DC I'm senator look where's this go from here you mentioned earlier that in fact that they're not going to be good people that ever want to say yes to get positions like this I wouldn't say us who wants to live through this\nWell I think the the contrast asked a question here said there's a report out today or poll out today that at the FBI supplemental background check doesn't change things\nSixty percent of the people leave the judge Kevin ... on the bench so if it if that doesn't you know all I can say is it the stakes are high who would follow Kavanaugh after this they will destroy everything we stand for Republicans if we legitimize this it only happens to why is it always just us\nThis is a time to fight back stand behind Kavanaugh getting the votes he needs he's a great judge and destroy what I think it's been a process that will destroy the country\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions or you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been mirrored in slandered or by all the right people just so yeah I mean people that hate me too so I ...\nI don't think you'll find that I don't think you had a fine or moment in all the years I've known you and you know we've had disagreements over land a keg ...

I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her\nHer country with incredible honor and distinction and and Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a recipe is simple that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nAll that it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hauled and you see Republicans and important Senate races now and dead heat in all of these states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to do stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your\nIt everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things\nThey're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me I just don't think people are Americans\nAre going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we've been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever the vista nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor Ford there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nTo to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eyewitness said that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker is that something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe that they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look let's be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of the Cade I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks whatever the Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful\nUm he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you a pin the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhy do you just put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\n[noise] one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes\nI Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote\nBecause that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back in the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator or in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote\nAnd if our side does show up and vote I think this could be one of the most historic elections than you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would the rest of the oil behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker the houses in Nineteen

he does not recall a Julie sweating it another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nSo if you cannot get a single person given to you named given to you that would corroborate their story to actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing\nNot not in significant facts but the most significant facts remember the story was about\nAlmost on a weekend basis and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys lined up the whole ... ... so they could gang rape them\nWell I'm Me gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party you don't know if he did anything to the punch this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this\nIs beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation\nIf they had witnesses if there wasn't a changing shifting story if there wasn't dramatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because\nThey want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other thing there are victims people I Know in my life of sexual abuse\nI Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil these people are\nPredators they need to get off our streets but you've gotta\nHave some cooperation to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process and simple common sense\nOr do we believe in guilt by accusations because in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case\nWhat you see is a lot of smearing a lot of smoke a lot of blood shunning but no evidence", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "06"}
