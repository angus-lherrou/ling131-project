for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care and it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep\nThe prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shots\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from\nNancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare

we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let the men nor can he because

terms of ... this is a very consequential election and I looked at item after item after item on\nAnd I see that we're going to be in the Senate and my guess is we're somewhere between plus three and a number I don't have the courage to say 'cause it's too high now but I can see the\nWay have you ever not had the courage to speak your mind that just is not true while you're listening but look I'm urging people to be cautious and and act like you're behind because I think we shouldn't take anything for granted\nLike I Believe that Marsha Blackburn is going to win I Believe that ... going to win in Missouri I Believe Heidi Heitkamp is done I Believe that Braun is going to win as long as people don't vote libertarian in ... Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban for Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and I actually look up to a different levels you have then goes on in a very on state where the Democrats should be safe but his personal guilt or when the\nSenate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority finding him guilty of a whole range of things and some very very unsavory rumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll Kevin to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else and help them get back in the New Jersey because we got a few can I'm really really good candidates Jews are great to see you know very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare\nCan help develop and sound practical working alternative to government run health care\nAnd um she didn't even have may well between his own bringing people out to vote\nAnd the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez and they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nOr how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over one of the things stay home and then they feel about run out one voted\nWhich you have to have ended up not having voted by election day you're not doing anything else that day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um\nWhere do you see the house going\nWell not functionally ah I I my personal range is reaching a bottom of about two oh one which would mean below sea ... and hiring them around too\nThirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy could end up his speaking um and I can't I mean all honesty I have always been candid about this I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nKnow I Can't either I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house um that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nAnyone who does not bode has effectively voted for an she should be no one should kids themselves\nIf you don't want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd then you'll have to house\nAnd people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services to the single phage\nIt tells you how crazy their party is how how could you know again she's smart lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services um she go down unless you to think of\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all you don't like to know why should sort of a I'm not going to not voting is in effect a half vote for him and she shouldn't be that should be [noise] um I think that's\nGood yeah I'm Still a ... there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for reticent in Tennessee you're you're voting for Schumer\nAnd I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody he wanted to some of these claims or a moderate Democrat\nAsked for for for a leader who say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of course and went on from that she goes you know I sort of have to do that fine to treat them throwing level if they said you owe I'm really kind of a moderate Democrat email I got to vote for ... defeat them who's giving out here\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence that this is a team sport because the radical end of the Democratic party's in control of your body that their leadership is just utterly unacceptable and that I think we have an obligation to ah\nI'm feeling it in common was launched and that is the killer a synagogue moves crazy a was intact deeply viciously anti Trump is not a pro Trump put all kinds of suggest any parallels between the gym memberships in order to them ...\nAnd that's why you get to ... why you know of people believe that large elements to lose media on opposed to the survival of America when which might be a better way to describe them and just being you know\nAgainst the people are they're not necessarily in people but many of them frankly I Believe our enemies of the survival of America's ... known it and we don't have that debate and get out in the open I think could ... who's lost his mind I'm just completely missile understands with nature of not seeing some\nCompletely understands any comparison a President Trump to any of the great to ... or ... you know Hitler judging Stalin mountains in London a mouser you're doing is just totally disgusting\nStatement on of a false showed\nThat people should just knocked down and the people who say only be held in total contempt mass murderers\nWho the exceptional Mussolini or the other was literally a mat much smugglers and that when I when I saw a ... a much mood who wrote the two thousand Fifteen 'cause he would rather go to Joseph Stalin than vote for Donald Trump and he's he's a good insurance limos we've you know how much information\nI just thought to myself these people are so the range\nBut you can't reason with them they need psychological out\nWell I think it's obvious they need psychological help there's no hope for them at all Newt Gingrich is with us eight hundred nine four one Sean are toll free telephone number well they get some calls in here six days out of the important midterm elections will start in New York they all knew seven ten wor\nUh the talk of New York New Jersey Long Island what's going on John how are you say Hi

health but I mean let's put their money where their mouth is and let them adopt these ... these families so that they can earn their pathway to citizenship instead of just walking across the border well thank you Mr Speaker\nI'm not like I think that's that's that's a pretty frankly it's a very reasonable statement of where we are and how we could approach it uh in terms of birthright itself or there is no provision fourteenth amendment [noise] once you're handing away Rick orange people who were born outside the jurisdiction of the law\nTo be considered as citizens and she's very including the beach on it when the Congress of the time when it's clearly if you read the ... the constitutional amendment ... very clear and what it means uh I\nPersonally think the president's far better off to moved ... challenge and Congress\nTo repeal it rather than do just as a presidential executive order because there was an executive order the next president who could reverse it but if you\nTurned it into a law there'll be a pretty hard law can do to change and once they got adopted and it's a healthy debate for us to have is a country because it comes back to exactly the same challenges the kind of it are we as a nation\nAre we allowed to define who is in American are we in a position where we can say to people who are not American you have to meet some test or to be considered a to B

Iranian are bringing you the latest in financial news and political commentary Saturday from six to seven AM and on Sundays from eleven to move we should listen daily for a financial news updates during Rush Limbaugh and the Michael berry show right here on this top five six nuclear [noise]\n[noise]\nPresident's denies playing politics with immigration at least the Brady Fox News reporters asking him a short time ago whether he's using the thousands of migrants heading north from Central America to scare voters ahead of next week's elections\nIt was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president get we had a democratic nominee for president when Orange County and found out that Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they had zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting 'cause most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls can or the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four safe democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats\nAnd all these thirty some odd toss ups are are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm can money ...\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest point it at forty nine years that you know in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it it Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living a at a forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nToo where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life\nAnd I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the house it's just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds a history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job for the people ... and you're\nA state and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic\nI think governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment or to be from California and representing California either or for\nReasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly get a new set\nA it is getting more and more for the ball to live in the state and we need to have it get to a point where that pendulum swings back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the ... you will ever happen swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and high taxation\nOf states like California and New York Illinois New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is the unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that at the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats than in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best of luck Sunday and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nIt's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out

to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was calling to talk about the health care\nWell I've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe're going to ...
