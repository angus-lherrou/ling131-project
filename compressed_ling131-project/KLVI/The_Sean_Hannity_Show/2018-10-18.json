desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence\nA which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative when you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance\nIs conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society with so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of\nWhat is now if you go back to Goldwater or fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American throw work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and in the end I think that just further isolates come\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because\nUh if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that

think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver\nFrom the public statements that these folks make the American public demands transparency and they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we talked about this\nNinety nine page report on fire the court a abuses that a ... director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts and engender by law enforcement officers to invade the law they there is by the way one author or as in you that no one really has X\nYeah and that's a fight the quarter review there is a court that just above the five to where it will also under their rule for\nProcedural motions there are three judges to chief justice of when you right now
