category five so powerful it could hit Georgia as a hurricane\nFrom Panama City Beach Florida straight to Augusta, Georgia and if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect to that point it's probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline tap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there and the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge these destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher\nOr over a million power outages we expect occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak rainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into\nThe Carolinas so uh everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina if you're in North Carolina you know you can make their preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in in harm's way today this is this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the into\nNorth Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas they're going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may have twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nPhony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense now\nHe was now are supposed to testify but those three people now\nLisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or\n... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but\nThe testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse is over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying did he or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page why why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to fine tune warrants you\nKnow that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the dot CA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just saying things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in ... when the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially at five application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tax confirmed that there is no there there\nBut anyway then they started ... media leaks strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip\nRod Rosenstein will testify Greg Jarrett damn bungee know much more all coming up stay with us\n[noise]\nHow do you address in hurricane Michael making landfall near Mexico Beach Florida this afternoon as a category ... storm with maximum

system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant\nInformation you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar there is no war it there's no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it\nOn a domestic crime that has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought it was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ\nThat would literally be weaponized seeing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people\nAnd that I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate him put together a flimsy dusty a with Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer warrant application but not one for\nThe original application and three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified that corroborate but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified my swearing you know we'll get into this you know with chairman Mark Meadows of Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about\nThat this is what we do we have a constitution for a reason\nThere's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant the bar is even higher when it comes to a Pfizer surveillance warrant and what has happened here is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal ever\nNow we've got three people on record saying that Rod Rosenstein well he has a plan hatched to surreptitiously record the president hopes that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and he won't even testify under oath said no and Congress's letting when I got to let him get away with that Trey Gowdy is going to let him get away with

David to get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys an application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for dot the aid that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim call me he's the one that signed the size of warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd are now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't wanna have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein and say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nAh as the impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and\nCongressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee I'll interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nAnd the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness to your lead in at Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have to\nRule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure\nSystem as simple and easy to use\nIt's incredibly intuitive and by the way there's no hidden fees no contract know installation fees that just go to simply say Hannity dot com today and you're going to say ten percent protect your home protect your family simply said Hannity dot com will take a quick break come back we'll continue also more coverage of hurricane Michael pounding the panhandle\n[noise]\nFind our round up as an action you do not want to miss it as they do a vinyl our free for all the Sean Hannity show\n\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this immunity Medicare\nIs is a family a group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you eight five five Ninety four Bible at eight five five nine four B.

... well I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of coal me the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number ... holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it your list interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that\nUh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final Pfizer warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nHave not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see the notes to take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with the FBI remember Mr ...

those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve adult\nSo the so called trio too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more importantly the
