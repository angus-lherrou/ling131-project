I Hope that people are Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort or with the Republican camp up by two\nAnd so we're following that race pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana I can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee she'd been a longtime friend of this program and recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television and we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives I mean because of gerrymandering up a big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats so we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share and NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made it was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIt's just simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire\nAnd fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources a phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions dean\nTo clear as they should have the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not\nSomething that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great with therapy for the world and I got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs around that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I Want to get in Michelle Obama was on the today show earlier today in an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans\nLet's go to holders comments and Hillary Clinton's comments you can't be several with anybody that disagrees with us listen\nTo show her all over my wife went really tight scare me [laughter] so you know when they go low we go low we read\n[noise] different radical ideas about\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that ... can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be civil of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil you gotta be kidding when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised hell you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want him to be afraid to their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional\nWondering Michelle Obama say anything when Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist mobs and they are moms\nAnd this this is Rand Paul point out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed in all of this if they allow this to continue but the rhetoric is coming from the ... so called leadership and by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a saint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nGo out and get your friends your neighbors to the doctor whether the whether they're Republican or you're with them I'm not at the foot listen burgers on Fox News also is a missile itself against the Sean Hannity do feel\nThat when someone is cruel or like a bully you don't stoop to their level you know our motto is\nWhen they go low we go high\nNo they're going lower than they've ever been and that's what we witnessed with judge Kavanaugh would know due process no presumption of innocence the most outrageous allegations that were thrown against this man and people still are I Believe I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat's a party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic fairness constitutional due process and the presumption of innocence that as an pain\nAnd we saw what happened to him but we see it every two and four years don't we and we're seeing it now and it's happening and you got people like let's see Maxine Waters Cory Booker Eric Holder yeah getting their face kick them when they're down you know follow them in the gas stations and grocery stores\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what's your stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house he endorsed [laughter] that twin

of the timeline and what we want is all you want to bring you didn't ask me questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this but first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going to go where when and on the policy yet the healthcare immigration pact or or my opponent is a color your liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you say they're pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and never come back talk big time during your right\nRight now it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nA she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running out in the resistance and out and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court ... Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the lap I think the er the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona a male love in Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there\nWas an if people want the full list the we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com\nOh so that people can check and make sure that that ... their congressmen or woman is in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days Congressman John\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting the because of the things that the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there that that left today is that they apply capitalistic when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who support the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary Neely says\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab\nHas taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nI mean the list is phenomenal did this the other day some but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced economy going for quaint two percent lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage to come over North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way\nAnd twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do those things\nCan make America why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together there's no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we've got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understand that he's not campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein enacting FBI directed his after the firing of Khomeini Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and the and McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves or the Russia investigation as as the caller is sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what\nDo you mean by that uh they brought\nYeah well I just go back to the way your frame that you own ... dot com it sounds like you're in Iran over its like at the specifics but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people\nBecause we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason and now he won't show up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying no to the American people and he when he just sat in your remarks\nThat the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong at that President is not good and I'll let him go on with the ...\nYeah San ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Muller investigation because of his involvement when his wife with\nHis his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should disqualify him Rosenstein is right about that but the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo\nFor why companies should be fired one of the things mountain was looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of calling me\nYou've gotta be kidding me so that guy's going to oversee this so both of those conflicts and so that that that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other and like you both right neither one of you should be involved in this special counsel any type of oversight\nI don't want to thank you both for being with us a congressman Brad the seven\nYou had your own ball non bird evolve supplies last call Lucy ... and for all nine ... thirty seven forty

they change from the Obama years what are they offering besides I hate Donald Trump\nWell like I said we had we care about any case we care that\nI we got a bad line again at the Jonathan what is it\nYou know something that you just said a second ago about how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter\nIs the fact that we're here and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that but we we have rhetoric in Washington DC that is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if\nThey are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college chains are number Supreme Court justice is ridiculous stuff like that and it's\nHow do you become a party that

way we live the constitution due process all these things\nI think people would be shocked at how much they are trying to get us away from the founding fathers instilled in to the constitution it's shocking\nHow how do you run on the idea that I Want you know the tax cuts the largest in history putting a thousand two thousand dollars and and the average family's pocket in this country that's real money for real families\nThe first pay raise they've had since like Nineteen Ninety in terms of real dollars and ... they call it oh those are just crumbs but they want the crumbs back yeah I mean how do you want the crumbs back how how many more Americans are going to lose their doctors their plans and pay you know\nA hundred percent more yeah and and that's over the course of a year in
