talking about the Pittsburgh should've gone synagogue shooter um we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert\nBowers and who he is he was a very ill an anti Semite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know took heat for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dumber the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all this as we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rose a very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody uh the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning I mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood\nI go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the the ... he was considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects of not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's cuts and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it's just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is going to become political\nAnd\nIt says you can count the seconds ... there's an interesting side note that there is no throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turn against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with Farrakhan and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we've had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nThat any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as anti Semitic bone in his body\nIs that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room with Mr Eric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling Farrah Khan members of Congress doing the same\nLinda source or another hater\nOr get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate\nIs that a bomb a nation what climate is he a way to sort of press releases about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ... praises\nResume or day uh terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a friend she's it praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um if words matter and those things matter a great deal\nAs it should be expected when

president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the

know and then they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and seen a photo but you know it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks till\nYou know seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up\nA Republican headquarters in Florida um we saw the terrible shooting in Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican Congress but yeah I have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota\nUh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch

should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should we saw about a\nWeek ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that let people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them and who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership and Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries\nAre from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner a and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks\nFor serving your country thank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and I haven't read the whole calling me up with my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question right on the market I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or for somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's ah basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... president for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd there's a lady out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again they'll great great mysteries is is\nWork of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people that the and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with which anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic American sovereignty and come in\nAnd if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself and don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a with a necessity it does seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humble and according to legal immigration procedures period the stone simply walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to get in the status if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm married and lives I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he says and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be\nGiven the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here are coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with the sun shine we don't want to hurt and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to the game I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being caught in the in the middle of this I'm simply used hub of really as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nI've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall and fencing and I can look across the fence and\nOn the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know a million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego and if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and\nAnd ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there as things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people but we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety there\nWithout question of what you've just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the ... that we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about\nIf you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion and we obviously cannot believe that we have to maintain control of\nKnow All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank

hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words there are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that
