sweating it was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it\nEven saying that well she gave us for names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she ... tracks on a story at what point does the man you know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously re Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go office civil discourse in this country\nI Am ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his dealings with passion indicates\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair his righteous indignation his his to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand you digital camera I Would hate to have that kind of\nInstrument Hi ... how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did a when you're previously wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question\nThat ah Christine Blasey Ford\nWas it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me so he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different or individuals\nOr she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\n... garden\nAt ... and contrast that with his response on the mark from a column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially legal she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself and it was a mashable reporter because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said with Diane Feinstein did is\nUnfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it\nAmazing to me or that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in\nCollege as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard and some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement saying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying\nIn fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again the statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and\nNobody else I mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer nobody told them\n\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you say just as I Do uh the the sweat Nick ... while the other sweating allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said\nAnd it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times this doesn't hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term if the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will

just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic\nParty culture where

and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite while this guy is dead and\nOn top of that then we've got this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how

news networks um thing about Michael I have an ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre there was nothing to the story [noise] um and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm since the story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want or expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in

Ford's planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers it'd be I don't\nI doubt if they're listening I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short list the hypothetical we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have allied salvaged have a process uh fate and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election use in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care as like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nA them ...
