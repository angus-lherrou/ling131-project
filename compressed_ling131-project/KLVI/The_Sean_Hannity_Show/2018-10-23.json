left that you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to total cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force it with a former

of a rage in a sense of\nThe legitimacy of the modern of American government which left passionately believes\nUh I I think that you're right that that's a factor the reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment\nIs these historic events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics it was historic what are we going to get\nA solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be mayor and parents were assassinated and lied and manipulated and browbeat and into backing down so that was that was a historic moment do have an effect with X forty or fifty

and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus

sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us and ah and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense or you know are often times phase is contagious and faith one can rub off on another phase breed\nBasically you guys getting my grilled Telhami Hannity you

with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view that I Do what we get to settle out at the ballot box I have\nHave a fear and when I say fear with him we got him myself that one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response would go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself what I had to wait another man of the ... that's why I say I'm a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up only me the only would come out with my wife told me would come out and then it would go by what my response would go by but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will do everything I can do to walk like\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but\nMost people don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people\nOur other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did well\nI look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges if the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison\nRight now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest\nOf his life but they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated you know some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am ... so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you've got to say that I have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is going is not what they told us that waking up\nAnd you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating at twenty or thirty percent of that fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message is recording tell him as a message to let them having the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here the media constantly bright and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get off the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this David if if we all believe\nIn in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability and our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the word or\nEducation from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within that tells you that God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people\nAnd that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he\nMeans to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left as authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white or read that book is a racist sexist massage in this Tacoma ...

country fight for this district a tight thanks for having me on to appreciate the shout out last week on TV as well great to be with you\nWell great to be with you look I've now identified the fifty races that I think will be the tipping point but the balance of power in the house\nAnd if people don't want to turn on the TV two weeks from tonight and hear the words speaker elect polo see well you're somebody that needs to win this is one of the top fifty races I'm following\nThat literally where the where the balance of power is going to be made in terms of who's going to control the house look I think we're going to do well in the Senate but you know off year elections are historically what they are and they're tough\nBut I Do think that you have a great chance of holding on to this seat because you've served the people in North Carolina oh\nSo this is a blue moon election for us here in North Carolina there is no governor no us centered on the ticket I'm at the top of the tickets so you know well that makes mom really proud of the same time uh it's I'm at the top of the ticket and so we got to make sure that people come out it for us uh Shaun this is a turnout turnout turnout election people just\nHave to get out and go vote a we've got all the way through November third and then back again on November ... plenty of early voting\nUm you know we've got a lot of good things on the ballot in North Carolina this year I'm I'm very excited I think we're going to win this but we've just got to do the work and we've got to have people turn out like the president knows how important that says he's been in the district um he's coming back again to the state here friday night\nThat's a sport my hope to be colleague mark Harris down your Charlotte but um yeah we've got a lot of tough races this year there's been a lot of articles written about North Carolina Thirteen\nBut you know like you said I'm a this is a clear contrast race I'm a conservative member of the Freedom Caucus I'm In a tough district I'm a small business center my ... she's one of the largest Nancy Pelosi donors she's against the tax cuts and JOBS Act\nShe's getting a lot of outside money from ... pack Tom ... the peach Trump guy uh promote violence superPAC that's come all that money is flooding and right here to the middle of North Carolina so it's a tough fight one that we can win but it's definitely a clear contrast up\nBoth the cook Political Report an odds maker Nate Silver and tightened their assessment of this race\nOr and the cook report actually listed this is North Carolina what you could explain the exact areas are that are going to be impacted by by this um this district anyway is among the five congressional districts across the country\nThat it said had shifted more towards democratic candidates and yours is gonna be a a bellwether district and you're going to come in I think your polls closed what seven thirty but I remember correctly on election night\nUh they do and so we're going to fight all the way through the end ah look this is a district that goes from Greensboro down to solve very over to Moore's veil\nUh this is a this is a great a district but it is one of the topics toughest districts and the state is if you look at those numbers it's an are six or so it is a real fight we knew this a twenty two months ago when I was sworn in
