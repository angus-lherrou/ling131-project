targeting high profile Democrats including former president bronco by Margaret\nExtremely angry upset unhappy about what we what this this morning and we will get to the\nThese mobs don't stop what they're doing now and the mobs in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages\nPipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on\nAlmost ... you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse you got to clear the hose you can't let these activists you\nKnow getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious but what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video up Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then just rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second you know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't this disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where\nPeople are dying now you have a few famous people that have had\nThese suspicious packages that had been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well somebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt\nI don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand

one to CNN New York headquarters ... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious package sent the Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're

civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watch it had happened to all these Republicans does any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life\nYou know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she put on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent\nThe Fox news and she literally had to spend an entire\nEight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today but\nI Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that was it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's dawn wall to wall with reports of suspicious packages and you\nKnow that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you\nKnow I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice in letters were actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel\nOther top officials in fact that story got so little coverage\nI barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that had happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve ... nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations they barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin in ... the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing but\nYou think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone\nElse has been silent about left or right when when we found out that the that's the least this shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that but the media today and their their reaction\nTo this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting lead partisan\nIt just it they're so quick to blame ... President Trump Fox News talk radio you got this NBC reporter saying that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of an extreme as fringe but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News and talk radio\nIn the last month over the most serious issues of their supporters has been definitely will get to that and what Thirteen Days away from the most important election mid term in our lifetimes [noise]\nHow people are gaming the system to get out of their rent\nAnd getting picked up from one place there had another place\nAnd how police are cracking down on cereal rent a Thursday on fixes it that\nYou can count on us [noise]\nFamily to take your question\nTo the candidate for a long for me to\nBe on the podium electric [laughter] hey FEMA [laughter]\nYou can count on\nFox\nNews to learn and Kathleen ... for threats of political violence of any kind to have no place in the United states of America president\nTrump can jamming suspicious packages and explosive devices into high level of Democrats activists and CNN contributor in New York one of the packages addressed to bill and Hillary Clinton at their suburban New York home\nWas intercept it we are fine thanks to the men and women of the secret service authorities also investigating suspicious packages send to former President Obama and democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters and Debbie Wasserman Schultz has already said devices in the packages were similar and crude\nPlenty of excitement in Simpson veils South Carolina where the one winning mega millions ticket was sold jackpot over a billion and a half\nDollars no one coming forward to claim it yes Fox News [noise]\nThis is Todd ... that's the bottom line June go around and are bringing you the latest in financial news and political commentary Saturday from six to seven AM and on Sundays from eleven to be sure to listen daily for our financial news updates during Rush Limbaugh and the Michael berry show right here on this top five sixty ...\nThere's something special about this time of year it's a chance to get out on the open road\nSpent some time with the family had when he died we know that these moments are what make life special and they're even more special and a new vehicle like a new twenty Eighteen cheap renegade with up to forty three hundred dollars off MS or ... during the day\nWas we got plenty of certified free on vehicles under the valves and yes that includes dry\nFor all nine to nine six thirty five hundred Morsi ... dodge dot com for more we need\nMore clear out here\nThank you for making April Colbert insurance agency a boom on the enterprise readers choice award winner pot\nThat said five five Texas fifty five Texas super food\nDot com thank you for making April Colbert insurance agency Bomani enterprise readers choice award winner\n[noise]\nI'm Harold man for tail v I knew it was a preliminary autopsy reports the death of a lover too man is consistent with drowning\nBuddy of twenty four year old cool with Colin ... felt Sunday afternoon nearer dirt pile in the night before the block who cooks like wrote in Lumberton three days that was reported missing water flew to found the sinuses and a kid he possibly growled find a lot of some results are expected\nTo be complete in six to eight weeks the investigation into his desk continues Port Arthur police are investigating the deadly shooting shooting occurred\nAround one forty five this morning a laundromat and the twenty nine or ... twenty fifth street the fifty six year old victim was transported across to the local hospital ... where he died detectors or using civilians from laundromat to try and identify the shooter any one of\nThe nation from eight to ... to go to south east Texas ... three three T.

didn't want to be like you know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected what's\nSo amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and\nWe and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff the same so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters and play that they are progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's got to be settled liberate once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse over and says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that our party has pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known to be true but my point is to have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and\nHearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to move the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOne for this is not a good choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred\nAnd a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that Phil Bredesen hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well day so\nIt's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's in a hurry to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do\nIn Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something I'm Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and ...\nCourt these folks then how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nI think yeah I I I think you should give it a little man I\nI you know we've got we got something happened in the southwest in the southeast and the thing that's remarkable about these states we've already have them we're getting a little bit more we still have undercover\nPeople in play is the ... in it and they're supposed to represent their states their constituencies but they say they don't they say it's all about Schumer it's all about the national wave we don't care about
