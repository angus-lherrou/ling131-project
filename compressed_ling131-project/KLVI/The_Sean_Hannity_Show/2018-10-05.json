more than\nAnything else is the the since here come telling amount of gravity that she gave to her decision\nAnd her speech and the gravity of the moment in an an bringing literally\nA sense of sanity\nTo what has become an absolute as she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from judge Kavanaugh his judicial temperament the questions that he specifically answered her passion about\nUh especially that and I disagree with her on on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice

all comes down to I guess at this point Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski and Lisa Murkowski appears to be a no and I guess mansion could be the yes\nIs our math right on this who else is outstanding at

I don't really get the sense after reading is they've been in hearing what are you saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today or that that really much impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons\nAs well as articulated by senator Collins and what was the most rebutting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade in precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of the seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI I just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction all this we have David\nShown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett box those legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant a ... with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Collins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote\nIs concerned and and I I the best part of what she said uh was re county many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate\nThey'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations and said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent duty and she announced her own standard\nFor considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers no into civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nOr and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present ...\nThat was probably the most impressive by main her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I've said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserve a a serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this did a grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold here now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion\nAnd Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that senator Collins each brought some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know the student to Senator Bill Cohen from Maine I was very close friend of mine whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... he thinks that the\n... paintings of Haitian class here in the ... on you can also without her Yahoo hunger turned him down ...\nCall came on the\n...

going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience\nOn this issue and she had it ... it was obvious she missed nothing she followed every single solitary detail of this process did all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged they've been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this

Nineteen sixty nine four hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama said I'm never coming back\nBy the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy

in eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... been surging lately ah where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabin offset but it's really what it is it's a ... gauge whether Trump voters a short you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited millions of voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nThey act it's got to see that the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked at ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours\nEntering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet or that the Republicans pull him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made their head the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for a for a super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's\nIt's not a big explosion but what it is is ... ... is coming back in and\nGalileo while ... Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process the party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWas shot I mean I don't quite know how to reply but I'll give you ...\nYou can just say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have\nIs that I'm going to lead in the house which right there you can lead to pick up the house and I think from what I see looking at the Senate races\nThey're all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats them from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her I think of America I think it's going to tell a very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going on inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did it to the man for support do you\nAre sitting on the disgusting\nAnd nobody who lie to you Eric poor experimenting Arlen and things like\nThat do you what they did to this man\nAnd how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou probably have the Democrats handle this\n... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I Would have a I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences\nWith the judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct that\nThe way this process has played out depresses me as an American first\nAnd a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying a the independence of our judiciary destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we\nStand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and there's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party [noise]\nUm I mean that's insanity to me\nAbsolutely and and I tell you what Doug does makes the point you have over four weeks\nWe'll have our Florida Georgia Line
