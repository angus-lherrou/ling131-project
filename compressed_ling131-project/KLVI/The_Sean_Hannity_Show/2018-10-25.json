seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for cabinet which was a good vote with the right thing to do um but with that had um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda\nAnd mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good\nAnd we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business\nAnd it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy is the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened to the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you\nSpent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the offer ... took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant\nNot very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court and you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's comment very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because\nIt's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when it town so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices procedural votes\nIs it something you depend on when your system do them you want someone you can depend on and less efficient\nSystems Hi I'm

eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paula in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and uh uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nAre no other stories or you know kind of take the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore\nIt was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf if we in two weeks we have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and West Virginia being and plays huge if\nWe can hold onto the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to happen by the way pre existing conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh ... outlets Seventy in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month the unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack a cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that\nBut it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been ...\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on an absolutely just like we need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that I've got a tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every it we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida real little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller needs to hang on in Nevada\nUh we definitely need Martha ...

he had any second an elevator\nWith either President Trump Mike Pence from Jeff Sessions and when it\nThey [laughter]\nThat's one of us have to come out alive [laughter]\nYour body cabinet [laughter]\nWilling\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [laughter]\n[noise] we in the face of Congress people\nSo when he was elected what I wrote on Twitter was we should impose martial law actually make sure that the Russians were involved in the final tally of like martial law what's wrong with you when you're alone is taking he wants to send an alternative border so I Would have been in the military to the White House to get here [laughter]\nYeah I Am hang gray outraged I have an awful lot about blowing up the White House\nYou know I had a dream the other night about\nThat I was playing golf with Donald Trump when I was standing beside him with a club in my hand and I was you know considering my options when I suddenly woke up and it was one of those dreams when you wanted to get back to sleep so you can finish it and I\nMiss a bird is up against the Sean Hannity still too low I Need you to go out and talk to your friends your neighbors I Want you to talk about whether the or whether they're Republican or you're with them in the\nPress always after he got word showers debate you know I was in high school like a chicken beyond the gym\nYou know when they go low [laughter] they go low we read was different and groaning about how\nThey go low we can't go doesn't marijuana punch him in the face I think an awful lot about blowing

here's here's just they truth that they will never tell they care about\nOnly Donald Trump Russia collusion with all the evidence that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nRussian lies disseminated them to you we the people in the lead up to the election that those Russian paid for lives of Hillary were used as the bulk of information presented to you know for Pfizer court judges\nThat the that
