of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot\nOr new and different\nHopefully better in some cases but are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago if the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well he's kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation is kept his promise on building the wall\nHe hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall but he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall in our record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years\nLast time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series\nHow far back that goes Hispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans\nAlso record low for our veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism\nIt's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there and we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nPelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they're going to now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nIn a while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood thinning of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was that if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dust\nIt was she was his boy\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker they told Baker what\nRod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers house interview\nHe was conveying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one statement says they got along fine but\nYou know Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\nHow you draw\nBoos I'm rich

five 'til the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now\nIs headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land that a category three a and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined\nFort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane Kate if they're in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThan weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hits in North Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm ...\nIt's also the overall pattern when Florence was coming into powder in the uh western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical site clones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese ... see it's maps came out and said look out October fifth\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic face it you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely\nAnd he said well what does that have to deal with as well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap on ... or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know I'd been showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with sports\nThis is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's hitting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nIn a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right after the to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moved up it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nThat is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nI don't know why people you know there are different people different styles and life

right\nRight and you you don't have\nA car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in adolescence MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I couldn't go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table when they were having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida hub the practice of any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create obstacles to access and care and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWater we ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to get it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care I think the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee yeah on the ... topic\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody shock\nGather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody it whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nAdopt ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much we're one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the politician there has in California is to send them an originality just throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice or providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so something a little stretching just brought by ... that access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance that don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month a\nAnd I mean but what it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\nNow everybody's welcome and everybody is priced at the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but well so now we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to get the you know the actual cost of medicine might be\nTen dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance we can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient ... this is a win for every\nA I applaud you guys for what you're doing and the fact that you've been able to\nDuplicate the model around the country speaks volumes about what your real mission is and that is saving people's lives and it's very inspiring
