that's coming to to a head I mean barring a disaster I mean\nIt only is is it's like the brains me of Obama in the sense that he's cool a beta or roar it's it it is they out side taxes phenomenon not

rock as a rock star it can be the twenty twenty nominate a yeah try and get through Ted Cruz ... good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border where the United states from Central America\nI Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen I I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people\nAnd what did Democrats what did they were just that they don't want a solution\nFor the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol where agents aren't so then they give like the perfect\nEntry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful or the president well he offered now we spent\nThree and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nWe need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor and any sense of constitutional\nOr authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence\nEven after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his life well now they want a nine to one\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex Rick Scott has killed himself and don't such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims amazing I'm maybe the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that\nBut you don't want them a little sick of a lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked that talk a good game and just they're lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that's why project very tossed catching reticent on tape and his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cow but he's not going to support cab and he's not going to\nBe but [laughter]\nI just can't believe that
