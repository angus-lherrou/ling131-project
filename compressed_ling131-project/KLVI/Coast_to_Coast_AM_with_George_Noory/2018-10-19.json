hundred dollar silver prediction nuts I got Kevin demanded a blur capital with me today so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars an hour to narrow the cost of production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything that you can send out to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nWe do George or not make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce\nThe reporter the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas in nuclear combined\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution call now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation call one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nSeven Daniel full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals and lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty\nPercent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin would look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off\nThree finished hardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nNow since we video on demand TV channels completely devoted to him the best movies on UFOs into ministry conspiracies sense of science it's called us on TV all access you if we can be all access is now living in the ... who who Amazon ... apple he groom test us ... dot com\nAnd download the human ... absolutely and I do go to you and\nWho do not common subscribing now for universal access at Brussels devices that us on TV all access trusted for over Twenty years\nHow do you know the real Joyce's opposed to being so much to\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what is and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV like about uh how magicians are pulling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate like really really bad\nAnd it looks like we're all doing trickery of some ... I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving the reading\nAny questions I mean you shouldn't say well you know with the mother's name or anything like that why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe retailer on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magicians and and I told them I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons\nMagically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick or you were were you do the switch or anything like that I looked at videos I've slowed them down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal ... I Believe he started out doing magic tricks has many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd that's the kind of well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're slowing down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting\nYou know watches and clocks that haven't started in years\n[laughter] to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nI did a little magic when I was a kid I mean I wasn't I was really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven\nUh which really I think steered me into the field that I mean now I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really\nBe impressed with the trick I was visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe will not allow themselves to move out of a third mentioned no way of thinking so restrictive and limiting to higher consciousness go into a fourth dimension and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and other financial interests are very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because you're supposed to be\nGrowing in a consciousness of the kind of a digging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah indeed now George Will we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers our listeners your birth month in days you might\nHave a birthday and at first name possible short

short would try to get right in there and quickly if\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension is I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other\nPlanets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation and say yes a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and they're really disorders\nAs a psychic is

you said you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right he was and\nThink about that we can wish them well if they're going to

good word goer [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of a generation that went to the cemetery it's a lot you know and I found myself a

Monica mystical practices for your into the rooms beyond the physical though he leads\nPopular workshops all over the planet including\nThree you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network a noted the authors got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nGood debate dreaming weaving with George Foy\nLooking forward to this ... this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West distributed to see her on the upper figure and the psychic medium of mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the tea leaves the old fashioned way and she saw it might that she didn't tell us she went out room came back like face well she was right that when ... when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in the house bill the old my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body a three hour members rather a living on his uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened that sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field are you looking at the the the the the scalpel in the ... not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to living a pack a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate want to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride look up to go into some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and where I Am the sci fi very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that rather than I forget that I've got a buddy in a hospital bed back eventually opt to seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years or so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding that there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something like this\nPerson who could explained to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes with the same\nAnd sometimes when nuts so the gift of these experiences which rings my co dissociation was the buildup to eat the travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding of the world beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the ... moving all the time I'm Brett situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a face\nBecoming sit on my that is a backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you learn it now but you know go and they'll like you and one day all day you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I called\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self the cheerleader and conflict to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut we're leading parallel live this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now it was a medic parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams of venting conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survived physical death is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious\nAnd that's all that's going on ah this is the ancient an indigenous I'm standing as lived in my life and told stories from that life but in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my ...\nCrude but loving family members are ancestors a spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind the science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream events before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S hand understanding\nOf what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience as pop the dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from mine experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience because dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done and minutes you get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in this in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it I mean there's good times ... of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nThe Eighteen wheeler coming down\nThe hill to file on the other side of a blind spot\nFor example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact\nYou understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power life this become very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong in that that other parallel life\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost that time will be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations that people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family\nI'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we have connected to dramas

I was in the graveyard this week and I look at him\nAs an a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or that ice cold\nShe'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head said he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story but very great story I mean that introduces whole themes about you know the energy of the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coven to sudden\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an agent of simplicity but as I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that\nAnd that these examples proliferate so\n... you know ... how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you a caring again to have result your attitude travels ahead of you in life shaping wanted waking waking few around the next corner\nIs a very good reason every setting in life to pause and check your attitude check\nWhat is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nI think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind Matt ... into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality is a dense conscious so\nThat there's no hope of separating mind and that they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of this\nA breeze very exploring we have to remember the body has its own message is a discovery is that the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body the body sometimes seems to know things\nThat are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hit the gusher in my blood is boating and it's on the line you living in tents\nAnd after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland beat the white creating can but the white queen screams\nBefore she ... she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to do that before it took place on the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomena pre sentiment on the patriots symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people the guy was looted you well you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing we know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it you know so medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people\nAnd we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell acted dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams and the sense that you again to remember your dreams you got to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loose that dreaming you'd call it ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way up and back you're going to loosen treatment venture\nIs to start out lose to the state ... what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming in the workshops\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay this romance an adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky twilight state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images that rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the pole to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look at the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program and the method of attending to the dream like symbols\nOf everyday life Robert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams and felt the misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves to ever deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of health and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on the ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know worrying you and\nYour dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about\nTo be very misleading you got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll come

I didn't dreams who made travel into the realms where they are at home ... very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book in my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continue our lives\nWe perceive and dreams so I'll dreams maybe memories of ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again ah when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a ... because it negotiated through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid the price\nOf surviving that in coming back and adding his science and his scholarship to what he knew first and above deeper realities and giving us an incredible model of understanding with all the things we're talking about some of the great admirer of you\nWho wasn't young close who'd Sigmund Freud and then eventually they broke often had disputes\nFreud regarded as his air his ... young was driven was Freud favorite apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although a tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his own rights who made himself is number one study\nWhich is what you need to do to listen to to anything on dream some someone who's not a dream of\nDespite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on in dreams rather narrow theory and he tried to apply to human streams\nAnd you had famously a dream in which he's in a house that is on many levels and in the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is is uh the floor and bones and skills and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to Yom as something to do with you know a mother complex and the desire to see somebody dead ...\nAnd Yom didn't break with him at the moment then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into a coffin of narrow understanding\nAnd that breakup was very interesting was accompanied by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversations with human Floyd approaching that pops up\nThere's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to avoid stopped so how scared and confused and and and and you wrote in describing this he felt something ... and his belly like a hot sun is a new is going to happen again and there's another huge bang for the furniture sounds of blowing a pot\nSo what we're seeing in that episode is something that goes on in the phone this phenomena ... which is the thoughts and emotions we are carrying strongly\nCan have a physical impact on the world around us so it's a very interesting thing in my story about you'll you'll says from the afterlife that Freud has changed his opinion he's a vote on a long way since he died but they don't have much contact together now\nI Love it in your book mysterious realities the subtitle of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm what is the imaginable realm\nI imagine a round is a space between time and

a something that\nWould be near and dear to your uh uh thoughts George I'm I'm basically leading a bunch of people across the cornfield after basically I guess in EMP mhm that was a kid so I wouldn't have known anything about this this wouldn't have made any sense\nThere are no cars that were ... we were what we were all looking up in the sky and seeing these swarms as a I don't know like basically like a near earth orbit kind of battle for a satellite battle or something like that\nAnd ... and we're all kind of downtrodden and I keep having a damn dream\nAnd like a cognitive dream you you saw the future\nOr maybe I Hope not [laughter] and you are not as well and then also and I mean we're going and cross double a cornfield this more scans and and\nUm I and we're we have to make it

my father's place in the north words and\nI look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone upside down with one bag light in the middle for on each corner and I realized that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away um I Know that I'm going to get hit with\nEither a mess or something like ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so
