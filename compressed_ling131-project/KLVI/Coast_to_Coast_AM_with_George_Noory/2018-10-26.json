and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that\nBut I often start with I happen to believe at this point that the past and the president and the future all exists in the infinite realm our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you are seeing everything that is how do you know that\nWould question the question\nAnd often that stop someone\nBecause one can take\nA book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it

out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and dust goes much further\nStarting where the hype rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth and us fear Rickles shape that surround our entire solar system including the ... belt\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at my your files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object but Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply calls the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called era out in the type rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWell when I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing a go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying to mind and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body about five\nHundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune a good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so he has deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is\nAstronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start deliberate first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ...\nWhat about him for rent for it is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because we don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet no and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but\nIt's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system the perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing another direction so it it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like ... it's five thousand times more massive [noise] this is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might come from why use this massive object although ...\nYeah the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet\nHeading were inside of our solar system where Neptune and your interests are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAny that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nA discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do that for conversations and end up because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat even if\nShe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that that could be a planet but when you read like say about the ... true scholar in the translation that we're a card and done\nAnd you look at the carving one thing that always it's\nConfusing to me it's been talking about a Trump planet\nBut in the can of form or eleven got\nHold on right there in the

in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to those you've you worked on the eye PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that stuff's coming\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nations the United states included\nMy adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and Nick celebrating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assume that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which was or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their\nCities become inhabitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you go ... billions of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the central and trust\nStudents agency during the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a it in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we it was for years ago\nTo global climate change

how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars announced near the cost of production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now solar\nIn fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate you have anything that you can send out to listen to their so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Silber\nDo George or how to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce\nThe reporter the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip cool yes nuclear combined\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution call now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation call one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nIt's so important to get a great night's sleep and I can get that with my sleep number bed\nIt really is comfortable as has a certain set into it in mind is kept at Ninety which is nice firms setting for me the new sleeve number three sixty smart but also helps every one from parents to pro athletes improve their daily performance through proven sleep quality it's so important to get that\nSo many couples disagree on mattress firmness sleep number beds let you choose your ideals furnace on each side so it's just right for both of you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "26"}
