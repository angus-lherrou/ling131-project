and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty that's weird\nWell it it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video streams to people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place but there are centralized system is of course so the fact that this was a global out it suggests that there was some kind of

and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer hum\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a\nSomething that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter]\nThere are also fared ...\nFederal um a fruit in lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway ... ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the next is\nWhen the company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for and other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent to use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treated lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan whatever\nHappened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budget um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars\nA year well I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a\nFour year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two\nYear what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but\nAlso really string students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently were\nLindsey a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and it really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem\nReally

[noise]\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three reason engineering and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is\nAh what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall you a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed\nI might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared more for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations in one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWith just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car and\nSo the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars\nKeeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... this if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it on line and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so\nIs these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's the joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because they're credited shots and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans\nBut still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the lending system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids and the sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollar she's crazy so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you George I got good news for you too man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big signs they drop support sealed and he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it but\nUh anyway I I drive a little bit of a trade school\nUh anyway uh whoever they used to work or I got on egg wildly and when a company went under the under the conflict and I'm a private plane crashed on missions to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but a company pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people so I ended up her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably more and you had more experience than most people\nYeah and I looked at the local school there and they were to import dollars that go for oh I I think it was\nThe horse just don't think well you know it's like they're away so I ended up going out and not spend thousands dollars on a very slow or learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price out if it's not\nA let's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sort of hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending\nUm and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew\nThat the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dead\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program and actually get the loan for given a and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sent to the IRS that says this is income for the sheer\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exchanged the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nDo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a that\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bakers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public benefits inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back and take final culture with you in just a moment

they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or

off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week\nI got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information as a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listening a breakdown of all of the costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the video he tried to negotiate with these people every there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think right\nAh and first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy rates back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third and third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise]\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the alone no type of\nAll to you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a\nThird party closing up like like what you described and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public a clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe ...\nWe were to the federal government so so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you've never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think

documentary that I put out to tell the story or off\nYour credit cram a care but she can take your life that story and and really to try in one human trait to tell as as fast as I can tell the story of the U.S government don't want any relationship with the\nPhenomenon or watch every decade now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are actually be staggering the town that has been the biggest single revelation the UFO community I think decade I the only story that I think comes\nAnd I would say this is that the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm an Asian feel but the day and you're like you say Oh yes they said no no since project three ... closed down we haven't been doing this with no in traffic or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try\nTo train on angle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk\nOf mistreatment both they're all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this Robert Bigelow Senator Harry Reid told the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff nicotine because it's coming from all different directions these days\nThink the answer to that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in once and for years people have said the\nProblem is that they can do with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the eight story with with these revelations we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just the confusing mess if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they're landmark story on this on\nThe sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to their benefit one but now the public has been absent people about it thinking yeah well this video and then the walk by and then the\nMillionaire businessman and and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film will get a lot in the course tonight but still a specifically about\nWell I took a logs on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seat and then you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you can sit in the ... said a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this and when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did cite teamed up with Warren coils from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a a recording studio ... you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike alone I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final product no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFor me it's a completely new role to me I I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a\nA a great movie but um you know I I was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to talk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on to the platforms that the young people\nThe watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take the subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but to young people and and another thing\nIs you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference\nWhere he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um\nAnd it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I Want to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization M E T I O\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had what he says in the ...\nSituations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't\nFrankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\n\n\n\nFive seconds almost goes [noise]\n...

you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's tempted Star Wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of a ... intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course the those remarks are very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally saying how quickly we we would set aside our differences down here on uh if if we face some\nAlien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to win the cold or find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out that's right absolutely there's been there's still talk of disclosure are you you know I I'm\nArguing Steven bass and all the time Nick I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects do you think the the things that are happening now our governmental ways of trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I agree with you I don't think that kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people at the world we are not alone I don't think by\nAnd in here they are bringing them in yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that we've known about this or Seventy years that we can be overloaded questions\nTo answer about that no I I think it's more like clay and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up in a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about eight tip them through the classification and release of the British Government ... we are seeing government say effectively will look here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can really you know without compromising\nClassified information I'm ... and ... and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely government don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain Reese\nQuite what if we all dealing with something above and beyond comprehension that it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics which you say\nYou never know you you never know you know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today I'm not sure he knew what the what what he was drawing though when you say\nWell he was clearly a fishing or a genius and have been a time travel [laughter] well I'm\nNot sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yeah but I think\nThere are some some others or you know I had a job in the ministry defense where I was paid to think the I think people so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that psychic work more that has the ministry you did\nYeah I absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nYou saw that any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they will psychics and they wanted to volunteer their services to the intelligence community to help us well you know locate\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines or a mosque by some ... button that sort of thing so we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact scenario probably won't work but if it does the payoff is so big wine on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government of course had three over the years that we know about grill flame some street can Stargate the ministry of defense going into this briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd do the study which which was classified I think secret you Kaylee is only it's nailed declassified and only minutes she defends website actually on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's out there it it wasn't a very good study I have to say\nIt um didn't live in the last ... some of the U. S.\nPrograms and and because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they work so much in silos but they didn't go out and talk to the people that they probably should have talked to I some of the people involved in Stargate and real frame and from tree\nWhat do you what do you think of rumors about a congressional hearing on your phones as well to adopt these\nYes it has I and actually this this is a big breaking news story literally just this week it it turns out it's more than rumors I'm only know from reliable sources that the Senate\nUm service um Services Committee\nHas already started looking at the two thousand four main incident which of course was the focus of of some of these these the classified videos that we've been talking about they've interviewed at least to the pilot and I think one of the radar arthritis\nSo so we have the Senate Armed Services Committee involved we also in parallel half the house armed services committee involved\nAnd if you look at the congressional record for the house armed services committee dated\nA pulled knowing you will see a paragraph tucked away in ... I think it's run through about forty three forty four pages but All right there on the second page paragraph for three I Won\nIt says that the CIA sit ... supply the committee with a briefing on basically what I did\nNick when we come back let's talk more about these rumors of congressional hearings and then we'll take phone calls spinal our just ahead with Nicole bunk coast to coast

talks of congressional hearings would you think could happen it could happen when\nI'm I suspect now it'll be next year because of of course we've we've just had the bruising judge Kavanaugh um ...\nSong ... coming up to the midterms but as I say we know the Senate Armed Services Committee and the house\nArmed services committee have been looking for the ... ... have been doing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the whiter question off you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy para I think it was a has had some discussions with the\nChair of the uh science technology and space committee and the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of don't fight about that I mean that's another point if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolve into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings be as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology and space main committee I think\nThink it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly it was a military and intelligence program and I just\nCan't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and its terms of reference about unconventional threats will if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay\nA mystery it's it's ... so so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing myself and I sit and they said that I'd be happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think it is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that I've actually gone into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nNot bothering us one us no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster is out there doing what they do to get the word out next\nI absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately only got the ... one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with aliens and again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes right you're right in documentary well I I take the same view newspaper articles\nAnd this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily\nNearing agreed on line or two\nThat yeah I absolutely as they will have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and ...\nCommittee interest and I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it it's it's staggering but have before articles I've seen about this or for the immigration one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line or I'd love to see a survey of a twenty five thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety eight percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course all of the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we'd only write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's certainly ... but now I guess my my reaction should be well great like\nGets exactly gets the attention [laughter] absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies say Brian\nHey George morning\nHey good to talk to you again\nHey hey ah first of all
