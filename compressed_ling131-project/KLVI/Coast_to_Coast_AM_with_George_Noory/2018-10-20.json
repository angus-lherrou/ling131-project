colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing\nThat us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in\nViolation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have a not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty\nFive hundred kilometers in violation of that a\nWave tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty two new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it you know that is cutting back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads in about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviet from the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology um that is of course being shared a\nSignificantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok a chain\nThe exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nSoldiers thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off\nThe east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states now practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\n\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nYou know even though we suffer Terry and she still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting pollutant as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just\nCome out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests and in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the\nRussian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for taking time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I got to jump in here will pick this up on the other side of the lines

dominance in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this has caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military\nIt's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they\nCan monitor your own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing ah you know they are a U.S company and you would think that ah they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so now they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about Saudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood has given

proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of has to Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as a cause so sugary situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Mohammed than so solemn and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and had him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese and Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nOn it and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with and of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are aligned with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something like\nThat that the idea being that we we have to

Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea or the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario a it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into says ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the dog and mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a

current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years of very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather\nYou see the Iranians certainly the Turks are sort of our allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and\nAnd put together that country wants a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here not confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou make your to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know it's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had or want her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into a Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run\nA and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants\nTo alternately well the it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO ostensibly use to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practiced secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it a witness Islamic

welcome good morning\nKnow Richard yeah for the near death the last many days\nThey didn't have my ailments are or many and um I\nHad an epiphany they saw something very important\nAll right what did you see\nI saw a guy that for one thing I've ever been so much and I went\nUm you will see a your life are all these different events that you choose just one on that one would ever you could get to pick because you can pick\nAnd your guy will advise you well um you could use some of that life uh and yes you do get to choose and um you ... when you do ... is your soul family that may have been\nA they switch 'em and they switched roles\nUh depending upon what they're learning experiences are so you can't come back with a several of the people that you've been a living or incarcerated from a previous life\nHere's the problem I have sort of philosophically with without a and is it possible that we in reincarnate I suppose I I don't happen to believe it that's just me but here's one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example or to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and pleasing men but we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will advise us in the in the physical to get out of those relationships\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from then they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships or we leave\n'em I I I understand that when when the child is young there's no place they can run into\nA because it's if it's parents siblings and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous um\nCircumstances yes if this is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what we're over calming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also if for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take\nAnd it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern so we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves\nAnd they become a hero in their own life because of the person that they may have abused as they've been abusing\nThey may take them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guys in angels that do help us it is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in guys\nAll right Joe thank you for that a friend is on the wild card line she's in Clearwater, Florida ...\nYes thank you for taking my call\nYou're a three weeks ago I asked your help in winning a new roof\nOh yes I Do have\nI'm coming back to thank you and the coach listeners there were so kind and calling and I

N. F. where the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that\nWe've tractor cruise missile we call the nine and seven to nine or that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it it should concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really crossed the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off\nThe east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north\nKorean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished or when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later\nAssurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\n\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know potent of course have captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nAnd it's just you know for any time over the top\nShy for the interruption I got a jump in here will pick us up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis yours
