want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I just spoke\nHated it I thought well now a as well you might as well get up move around on it all\nAs otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there\nAnd uh I was like whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening\nAnd a wintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like everybody in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck just about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a oh I Am a at the water right and tied up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I\nI got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good\nNeed to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that often enough and the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and um yeah they're to me it then you know I didn't feel any threat from them it\nWas just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know\nA were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backwards or there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know\nOf what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed\nBe thy name leaders are doing that under my\nIn my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where she looked at me and I was an outer ring a word she says are you pray him\nAnd I says yep [noise] and she goes even better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck\nYou know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb when we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that bothers the lord\nJesus in my heart but you had these strange environment by nothing is going to be stronger than the the liked it in me\nWhat do you think

think so no I I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um\nWhen me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul yeah it was weird I I had talked to this only to my
