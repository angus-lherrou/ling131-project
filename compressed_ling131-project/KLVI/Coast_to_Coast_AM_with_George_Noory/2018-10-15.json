if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty and then when I come from any federal judges for the next two years

we were talking about the inventory still in the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dream still up\nA ... for ... says mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nLike on my news website over a coast to coast am on the street there there are elusive papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the top\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nUm ah the review are or who was it was very well known or ... or drop here who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then\nBefore each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty two or three ... so he found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these\n... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpret it what does it mean a it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until\nI took a look at it again now how\nMany layers total and in the forty two story Great Pyramid how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and\nAh originally two hundred and ten originally\nIs there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who said the pyramid\nWas not completed that was that they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... brother ... and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic whom uh his brother about two and she's in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek\nA and of course other people say it was and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of that Ficre layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps is that every twelve is there some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you would you just you know simple mind that I thought each step they weren't just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their parents with the subject called they called it set at\nWhich is the pyramid and go and it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how the conceptual lies a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course no I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen that are decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I think I said that a bill ... to ... um shot a shock to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't an arcade into picked up her\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that costs ... ... it was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper\nAnd why the

are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you that's three hundred ... a a scrawled on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a voyage we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for\nThese must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing bowl and you're right I'm I'm On this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a or specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also listed and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run a over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have\nThere seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know those courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right well then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven\nEight absolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth from Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nUh so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a question I'm thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round facts of the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight or we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower [noise]\nUm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact the tower [noise]\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\nNo row eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be\nA you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy yeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of\nThe lion and the use of the lion at go badly tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go back tabby the erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go back leads happy not an accident\nNo within references of course uh with lines too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite

and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that you could\nIn architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties a remote viewing into an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern\nReconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there's something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter\nA menu alien um they are basically recreating gives a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to\nUh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with a number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know that just simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\n... one more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about a\nA son he awash or I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned\nWhat is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public and I'll take my answer on the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there are now with you\nRegarding talked about so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so I'm the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they've won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is is bizarre yeah how was it was a job of director there\nHe I think he is actually involved or Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved a ... at these not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of mixed\nBack here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it at all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to search them and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said some political right now and I understand that my new it and I respect that yeah I mean there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stand and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back that'll\nYeah so it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot the name was Daniel I think right yes\nYeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of uh\nBoys they can they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good

were which is the looming of\nAny other language or like when you're ... or you can get a looming of a\nOf a\nWhich is a believe a lot of the shows are are doing this for quite a bit so uh [noise] [noise] oh sorry about it a low\nOkay so I think well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is ah the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\n... to ... to ... ... ... it's it's ... for the push language\nKush which which is of course I'd like to buy toilet five years ago\nOr ... or ... or ... you know we're talking about a quite of the way it does for ... years ago\nThat ... ... older than any other language you can put in the fall of the so called ... which was a ... who is this big well it's a cush ... it'll ridge back which are from the coach\nWhich is do you think like I was a little late it was people well the pilot or\nThe ... you know ... or some way or the wall\nI I'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thank you for the phone call\nA minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite thanks for in terms I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so you get politicians are saying that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking\nDoesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared and that's all I Know about it offhand I said what I've read about this before but I don't want to\nSay something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here a bomb we're ... we're going back to a man as a um and the\nFirst and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings yeah\nRight right like in armor and men is uh the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same\nA menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different kings they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another ah\nI have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\n[noise] yeah um yeah I Can't really\nDon it 'cause I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king had five different titles\nUm and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called Horace ... so it was horse in the armor\nAnd horse or a ... so uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a ... you know the designation a nest to invent which is basically referring to operate or Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up and I was like twelve hundred BC is the first time it was used\nThere you go

really am glad that you're on the show a ... I really wanted to ask you for your um [noise] uh expertise on this if you guys have ever heard is there an opening or any access\nBehind the ... year old on top of their head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the paw and the back\nSomewhere like that that has access to an insight chamber of this of the things that I'm holds or something very dear to humanity that we are uh [noise]\nWe are not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWell Jay you're in luck because [laughter] man who's been researching the ... paper about it so I I'm a ... now my new before we get to what's underneath the ball on the left or from the left from Paul\nUh there has been photographs of the top of this being tried in the ground up or what appears to be I have\nTo roll but and I have also read a lot of research about uh the right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year so let's talk about uh the head of this thing's first and possible entrances\nYes so there is that there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts ah ... was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep I'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind pouch but\nUm but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that um\nI can tell you that the uh you know the world's a crucial um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another line pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's the exactly the conclusions are that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book and he proposed this these on logistics base is basically to get the stones up the pyramid and\nThis cat from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be theological and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me or you know your review to paper\nA but she still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because the\nPyramid of cool too it's it's it's hot spaces inside researches in the sixties ... pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know what was your image but in ...

morning\nHere in Southern California my new uh the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid you can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you notice is are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as Egypt ...\nTraits meaning that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do you knows referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of Indy the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\n... as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit er and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off ... ...\nThat the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would've been a you know it's here and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter a it's a very interesting a very interesting theory and others have proposed similar things there's\nEven a here with I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not if you're a median but it's here so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it um\nNow you've got to anomalies and a and one is clearly defined at roe one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI acting so how big would it be\nThe way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be ... may be no more than five feet or something like that five feet by height I'm saying right you know\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and it would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the on SCAD especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year scan was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a uh in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan your show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stacked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph couch and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of that pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not all be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it you mean by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that uh who Donnan buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable states you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know the Jeff to pay the people to experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to things and hope to things that\nIs a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is

they published a paper that you can read all of his papers over on his website Chiapas pyramid\nA dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now my new before we get back to the calls I have talked to you before and I mentioned this in my opening little rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seem to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly then what happened in Egypt after Cleopatra\nAnd we had that ah example of it but it was going on ... for a year she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this uh last week on my other show fade to black which is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us\nThan she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there are there's only two thousand years I'm On this side of of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original stinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time and more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because ah I ... as Graham Hancock a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis uh these earlier people and uh the only thing that survive tore some about these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one with ... uh you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has an easier and that you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie\nUm and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible my here with the

the great pyramid doesn't it Manu Clare\nRight and I was so they have a couple of comments about your question Dorothy so first of all Christopher done or when he was talking with Jimmy a few days ago um I think uh if you ask Christopher done if a if his model his theory\nMakes has room for the you know extra space is a purely he may say yes\nI'm a so I could because it because of these residences engine oil electromagnetic energy focusing and all those things so that's the first part of your ah one ounce or the other answer about ... you were talking about the spirits of the kings so I you know in sort of the same vein I I think\nSo first of all the Egyptians did make rooms\nFor spirits of the king and for a ... to receive offerings basically so we know that ... had a small room in front of his pyramid where a statue of him was placed\nAnd uh it was basically looking out to the little uh you know the cold\nUm and ah have me or do you ask about him you know so he you know or his must stop I actually had as a room a small room and the statue of him was placed in that room and then it was wild up and what was that for it was for spirit\nTo receive offerings of from you know his family and so I think you are I think you're absolutely right and in fact what you're asking is very much in line with what the Egyptian believed\nThat uh uh you know that are just the spirits were very much there there were very much present and they just have to be housed inside of either a mommy or a statue and then it became alive and uh and it was still interacting with a family members
