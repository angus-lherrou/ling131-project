... project\nA groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies he learned as a police officer\nTo the sasquatch legit immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist to give accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell it may have been focusing on missing or one one for the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so areas with a new work it's an archive a big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think Dave is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\n[noise] hey George thanks again for having me\nA absolutely no times on the show and I appreciate it [noise]\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that we had my interest I think it's an old topic that uh [noise] there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going to the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on the first pages of new\nThe news articles and such and I started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like Bigfoot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nIt we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man the giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago when you were first year recap the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the Sierras\nAnd they found each other later in business\nAnd you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter\nAnd they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said it's your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to Hooper which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek were the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nAnd what the showed was that the pipette went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side to the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this this winter was sent to ... and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\n[noise] and during that process of getting the DNA extracting DNA one of the places that they used was ... than a crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this these samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce Melba to a very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explain to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper\nBut if you extract all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten ... tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big but ... hair take us into the break\n\nUm Harry\nNo\nKnown asked me alive\nOr\nDead now held by exes home I was a marine on yeah the\n\nNews on ... the top Democrat on the house intelligence committee saying the recent murder of Saudi journalist ... show gave the U.S and the Saudi embassy in Turkey should push the U.S to reassess its relationship with the king and I think\nThis ought to be a relationship altering event or for the U.S in Saudi Arabia that we ought to suspend\nMilitary sales we ought to suspend certain security assistance or and we ought to impose sanctions on any of those that were directly involved in this murder\nOn the phone your Congressman Adam Schiff on ABC's This week newly form hurricane will uh gaining springs a category ... storm said to make landfall Tuesday in West central and south western Mexico maximum wind one hundred and forty five miles per hour reciprocation\nFlash flooding storm surge in of course a very very strong when\n... the national Hurricane Center this is Fox News\n\nAnd a new start five sixty kill me ah broadcasting from ... studios [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAll covered with\nZone [noise]\nY'all better [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] ...\nWhen\nWe come visit\nThis news goes to goes to ... am with your unit [noise]\nOkay so does that mean against me we we were looking for some songs written about big butt and there are several uh I Would have to\nPut it this way though the definitive big put song has yet to be written that one [noise] why uh burrows Smith\nWas supposedly written by Johnny Cash and that's what it says on line I'm Still not sure that that's true\nBut uh it's interesting tune interesting attempt at an anyway we're talking with David politeness about his new book big wild man and giants archive articles sixty and eighty to Nineteen twenty two\nThere are hundreds of them hundreds of credible stories about a different creatures that look sort of like an animal and look sort of like a man and close up encounters including some famous people\nAnd we're going to hear some of those stories are in a moment we're going to continue our conversation about the DNA evidence that they apply to help to uncover with Melba catch him in just a moment here on coast to coast am [noise]\n... saw had I lodged top ... they'll say look killer decided to stop talking kind of Laura ... is just incredible she said I never ... pins and needles ran my hot when I have the extra auditor and two and a half months later\nSomething amazing which will taste while I was actually a ... a staggering about this was the staging a chick ... ...\nI started kind of sweet ... results coming for it\nA blonde haired caused some excuse the pun ...\nNetworks beautifully owner\nRichard hospital here we're talking about the power waking up your immune system and says he'll this gentleman's hard hats the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit\nC.

[noise]\n\nWell come back we're talking with David polite us about big what Wildman and giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty a describing these creatures people ... whatever you want to call them\nAnd before the break David Was explaining how why he and some colleagues had collected a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to\nVery a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um ... observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\n[noise] well that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it or this wasn't some half ale treatment it was it was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake\nAll of the labs got the same results or it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big for her that people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well big foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nWith incredible strength in size and when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community in the big foot world that is very adamant that they're an ape throws this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people will try\nAnd this article goes right to that point and nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out and when I when I found it I couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it\n\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\n... years later nine years while I can I can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west in in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big what started to Nineteen fifty eight so before then people in other words for ... and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you have collected they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean\nThey they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry\nUm they don't know what else to call them\nSo walk for like a man walked upright and doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like an ape um\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic very elusive a ... I don't know anybody that's claimed who have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the article or are made me chuckle a little bit\nBecause the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old a ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how how's Fred that decided to leave\nI'm going to live and that type of environment\nAt and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nBut the said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference to that you made but he had an encounter it's a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I think it was like yeah\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMay be some exporters wrote about that they hurt in which he encountered so\nBut again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an ex or from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore note that\nThis thing came up to him while he's on his worst and look I'd I actually spoke\nTo him large hairy bike he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a ... foot and it came from the ... church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things happen happen Dickey with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from shock valet you wrote about it and they have a clip from September Seventy sixteen eighty it was a record it in his book wonder in the sky a large black wildlife mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge error covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive um big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter]\nYou know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm delivering for a while I don't think anybody's ever heard of it\nAnd uh his book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this topic it was a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and uh it's a tremendous book people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archive articles sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty

[noise]\n\n... you know looking back at your your original book Hooper project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus or a\nThird of matches what other tribes dated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years in occupied land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film and it's you know people can argue about it all day what as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or ape\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings of and this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did when it came on film and wanting Harvey has the ability yet\nIf let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on a hat on\nAnd they're caught on camera leaving Barbie has an inability here are the face I can see with the face looks like so you can identify the suspect so\nApply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by Ted it's in tribal Bigfoot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your account the news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are are in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take\nVariety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows what what was what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited yeah in ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were sure they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about uh let's say a twelve year old\nKid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California uh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that\nHunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encountered what they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder to chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big boy that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did\nAnd since the fall on on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies of people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth\nAnd you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up so when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you\nKnow there was never any names attached to it though no no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman or policemen\nCredible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nWith your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast they are\nDoing we\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com gauge blaming we are to\nBlame on the coast on you don't mind the hail me\nTo reward\nWalks news on all Stevens many members of Congress not buying an official explanation on how Saudi journalist or ... show was killed in Turkey earlier this month the spotlight now on the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI Believe in five of his top personal bodyguards or those among those currently accused in the Eighteen his personal bodyguards and one of them is said publicly a year ago I don't move without an order from the executive\nIllinois Senator Dick Durbin on NBC's Meet the press gas prices dropping down five cents a gallon to to Ninety two for regular right\nNow the high end this simple of cities San Francisco three eighty five for regular grade and the lowest Charleston South Carolina to fifty five\nAnd was truly lumber publishers the lumber survey and the national average a year ago to forty six a gallon and this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nOctober twenty second what's new today on the breed her radio ads I check out our entire radio resentment inside the studio me during a brand new episode with the legendary\nSir Paul McCartney know him and treat to bomb that film with Joe levy to talking about his new album Egypt the Asian and of course some discussion about a little band called the ... we were ... when we were playing music I heart radio present inside in the studio check it out now\nIn Nineteen Seventy six Bob Seeger releases his ninth studio album night move is his first with a silver bullet band group of Detroit area musicians that helped launch the you're into the mainstream singles included the title track main street in rock 'n' roll never forget\nAlso this week in Nineteen Seventy six Led Zeppelin who avoided TV appearances because of sound problems appear on American television for the first time when they played Don ... run from American standard nerd dot com studios\nSo I\n[noise]\nAnd I really\n[noise]\n[noise]\nTo talk to Georgia now called the wildcard minded eight one eight times zero one one zero in on\nThe first time caller line is the one eight vibe zero one for civil to one\nTo talk to free from east of the Rockies goal eight hundred eight to five bombs zero three three from west to the Rockies toll free goal eight hundred six one eight eight to wipe on this coast to coast am with George now\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney as they were known to do both had fragments of the individual songs but I'm together came up with I've got a feeling that was on unleaded beat sounded pretty good that's the Beatles\nWith of course Billy ... we're talking with Dave polite is about big foot wild ... giants archived articles sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty to his new book and as I told ... some of these uh descriptions of the writing is just terrific on the part of\nReporters from long ago this is from the state ledger in Mississippi July Fourth\nEighteen eighty for the title while wizard of the woods in which\nThe reporter describes an encounter on one occasion heat the creature was seen about wearing a large fish with demonic hold greed in a short space of time between his massive jaws and enormous cheap the bones being crushed\nAs if they were straws this guy came to work that day and a and did his job we're going to go to the phones in a moment looks like they're pretty full day polite is still working his magic with the coast to coast audience we'll be right back\n[noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness if possible you could add a trio the relation one of the leading causes of stir up my dad would be forced to like cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG divide them just Ninety nine dollars to order the cardio dot com\nK. hate our D.

L. vi [noise]\n\nWelcome back Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the two authors are Sarah black and acclaim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court I'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program a I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\n\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen of most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw\nUm I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of a ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb in stock\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\nImagine that and you know they're looking to what was available at the library I still find anything if someone's got to tell the story and from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it though I\nKnow I thought out what I could ... thought someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it fast forward graduated from college and no one told the story on the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found all Murphy who is chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was\nA kid with meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey said it all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so they have a couple of years later after I spent time with them and visit them at their homes they asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would\nImagine that being able to write the true story and correct wide and greet misperceptions and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell over the theory exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work\nAnd I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck\nWell what's there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm In being Indianapolis the storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since ... brothers\nBut we only face mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need to write a book I fall she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help and write the book [laughter] [laughter] so uh my joke is is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but a eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then uh we agreed to work on it together and\nWe didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we say that I guess the project is three and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people that were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started re you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she had been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you grab me ... my father was a at ... he drove a landing craft from those ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shift\nAnd I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us in our where your father drove\nThe landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater um victorious at us and now as well as nine other major battle\nAnd he had spent the last couple of years after the war running down all of the material that they shared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb\nUh on the continent of Europe\nNo one that in with me and then burn and very simple components of little boy and an island\nUm status final breathing yet or every year and and the conflict and so in writing the book we tried to pull back that land and bring in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese pointed in addition to murder we've had ever here you know in the county has got I'm highly commander\nAnd what we tried to do or where you have to recognize it even though men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing well\nI'll tell you what do we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes they\nNational Archives kill me I Love the south is home I don't know\nEvery four\nBlocks news on ... hurricane willow now dubbed the extremely dangerous near category ... storm in the Eastern Pacific on the path that could make landfall on Mexico's western coast in the coming days we\nProbably expect uh the outer reaches of the tropical storm force winds are like laid off later tonight or early Tuesday Morning\nWhen the maximum they went to one hundred and fifty five miles an hour many members of Congress looking for more details on the death of Saudi journalist ... wondering about future relations\nSo I Would ask the president to try the drug Emilia one true or whether it involves imposing sanctions whether it involves delaying arms sales making your clinic ...

I interrupted you before the break we you're about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYet a commander ... lieutenant commander hush I'm Out of out of a thing we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that\nThey were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great ...\nUm\nWell it was it and then more sort of published after the war first had a shift in Nineteen fifty two and a Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English and it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that\nWritten from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on it devoted to Indianapolis but because we were looking at the larger Pacific War and and is there at World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was a commander\nWho cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against\nProtocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors after ... for radar and more technology for his that marine because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his rather that commanders\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and\nThere was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived the\nMen were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored because the shark attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realized\nThings but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts\nUm the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported there were so sick they could walk on their back you know from shark the shark\nThat we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them\nThere's one account you have a sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's

was gonna wiggling toes as bait to lure of the sharks and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to it\nCenters that last minute and realize\nOh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so\nThey were doing the worst thing [laughter] so some of the worst effects when our our ... happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship that everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they're having this leader early\nA sale they think across the Philippines see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's there I mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rap between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups that for rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day\nOkay that's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available on the raft\nAnd so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and go by you know second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how they're the they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the those are and the dehydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one toward the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would drain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others with you know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ...\nAnd blood vessels bird blood cells ... from\nThe brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander um who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it'd sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... survey you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess at the end kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd you know the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in the area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son\nWho you know this gentleman Richard With Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and the recording at the one he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are a lot about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the

you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined or conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of ... through the cracks or that made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell at their mentioned there with the\nDeparture methods that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there was a tenant I'm looking I had read the the thing that is\nA ... a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and that as a matter of fact had received this report thing as much but he thought well if I don't have to report arrival that and shit I guess that means I don't\nIf you're reporting on are rivals either and then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until a PD one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell when the books are up about these pilots do dropped all the supplies and try to give these guys in the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more there are other supplies they have to head back and there was one guy who's swimming way up\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being so terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left in your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to win or lose men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know shift for CBP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't fit one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carried till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on all things did fall through the cracks but ah he's an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers do BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five\nAnd the war ended on August\nFourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth and fifteens Nineteen forty five and they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it until v J day\nThey announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over and then maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was you know resulted in the loss of almost nine hundred men\nOn the very brink of the end of the war\nSooner or talk to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this down the street split their family is now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who was involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame and a lot of\nPeople got blamed right there were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented the situation and so really you know at the time these names the you know admiral king Bruins limits and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of the area you know we won the war and\nIn the American public you know holds these men on this high platforms and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom and have them testify and Turner surname sick I don't think\nThat the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to court martial there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little ... to talk about the court martial of our mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commander in testified that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain is that he failed to the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two charges um and not only was it unprecedented to bring in commend her how she voted to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all for having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels fund\nAnd captain Charles McVeigh was the only cap and who was ever court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm\nSo as he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth\nAnd we found these records where the navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would stick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of the civic forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral\nOur theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick with McVeigh and so what they charged him with was failure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who\nUm heard him call abandoned ship and then heard it passed man demands the second ship as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned was failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across based course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese seven commander\nAnd indeed happened make they did see stick as the ... at evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk the standing orders that the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion\nUm and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have socked McVeigh whether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference but he was testifying and Japanese
