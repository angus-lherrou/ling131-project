NASCAR playoff\nHashtags Smithfield racing and um but at the picture there\nOf his burnout great burn out but I loved it victory lane you know he had his wife is two kids with them a definitely an exciting day I think for the whole family and a guy that I think it was kind of fifty fifty when I was like trying to kind of a\nPoll people's reactions just stand not actual people in the sport I'm not a ton of people had him moving onto this next around\nI didn't have a moving on to the cyber\nI say I don't think either of us did um so I liked seeing that and I liked seeing how gracious he was a with that when um I didn't I didn't know a lot about what I thought about his personality honest you know I just didn't know a whole lot about him on and uh\nI really liked his reaction like there is a Family Guy and that kind of adding to that he said I\nGot home and put the kids to bed took out the trash and recycling to the road back to reality\nWith the exception we have a new trophy in the house I'm a lucky guy and he's got that picture there from victory laying out his daughter and son beautiful wife and a new trophy to add to the house I can imagine they'll find somewhere quite special\nFor that and if I understood this right somebody one baking for life too because of his when Smith Neal had on the side of his car oddity there like a natural and you're I didn't even know that promotion was on the car and go he got to the start of advisers there are now I Would like to know who that is and\nUh I I saw a note from sports Business Journal this week this repeal really pulled back some other other marketing dollars with the NASCAR just focus on their sponsorship of air this year and\nAll the pretty happy with us so yeah it's paying off\nThis far for sure and you

home\nTo a gas can on his driveway and it says Kurt we thought you could use is love your neighbors and I thought I thought that was hilarious but also really liked occurred had such a good and sense of humor about it you know that could be obviously a frustrating way\nTo uh to lose and I'm going to follow that up with another tweet from him but yeah I had a good sense of humor about it so he said\nI'm after the race there uh I Know a lot of you are disappointed we fought hard for the W a proud of this your heart's racing team worked and went into a dominant weekend big congrats Eric on the roller consistency and the associating is all I can ask for check check\nGrace yesterday for an example you brought that up off the air rich on the Kansas Speedway plus thirty and a\nHas a picture

accomplishment thank you to arouse she ate for performance in mobile one so ah\nYeah he's pretty good right now to the point which I mean he's like the the under spoken their guy yeah I don't know I just love it\nHe's the only one of the story of guys diddly lap yeah pretty much second all day and that's where he finished yeah Jason pretty trip to make it through to absolutely a nigger\nBrown bird he is a writer for NFL and NASCAR they're on Yahoo or how a pretty long little post here from the weekend and he said worth noting that the caution before overtime at Talladega was five laps at a two point six six mile track with drivers on the edge\nFuel mileage caution before overtime at Dover with five laps and a one mile track\nI forgot about the red flag at Dover NASCAR put red flags on racing reference please I agree yep but yeah five laughter is a lot of caution in a situation like that it's the third straight race ended via a to lap restart and the first of those three not to have a red flag pre see a\nBrag exhaust the lead that than retweeted at both tweets there that and they put out and he said under rated tweets at wanting wanting to kind of gauge your thoughts on\nThat show I understand what he's talking about it because that is you know guys are on the edge of fuel and allow their even under caution burns a lot of people because of how long it is but I Do understand NASCAR is reason for not going read\nBecause had they not gone right at Dover they would have run twelve laps probably underwriting because I get the laps complete is so much faster so I think that's why they didn't go read there because they knew they were going to get this ... five laps is not an unusually long caution why any track All right thanks so\nUh I don't that's not the the the flag that was controversial in my opinion it was what Kurt alluded to looking for and considers yes are you a NASCAR where they threw out the caution flag with the last lap record the truck raisins ... they didn't have the cup race I Know he\nWas asked me what a cruise they would have won the first yeah\nWhile I Would have loved that I actually it was kinda glad they let him race to the yeah yeah it's dumped at my guy ran out of\nGas yeah but I I think a one two three four finish this deal when an Airbus Fisher\nUm okay so Kyle often said wrapped weekend for us guys worked hard to try and make it faster but couldn't figure anything out able to set a salvage an okay finish but still and must win mode next week I'm Glad Kansas has been a good track for us\nWhat do you think how I

was who do you believe to be more honest do or Clinton the answer\nOver fifty percent Clinton around thirty percent so the people that are saying ... is the more honest of the two candidates but then I asked who would you vote for the answer do twenty eight percent Clinton's fifty eight percent\nNow this says something does it not\nAbout the American electorate\nOn the one hand in question one they are asked who is honest\nAnd only a third of the people say President Clinton but then they're asked who are they going to vote for and two thirds of the people just about say President Clinton

right or wrong I haven't done very well with the stock market so there is no reason to believe this will be accurate but here is my prediction for what it's worth Bill Clinton is going to be reelected\nIf not in a landslide than by grapes margin\nRepublicans will hold Congress now I'm not sure about this one\nBut I Believe and I will predict the Republicans are going to hold Congress by a very slim margin the Senate will remain safely in the hands of the Republicans are within a seat or two at the most\nWithin a year after the election the Clinton Administration is going to in my estimation be buried\nIn scandal so that takes my prediction about a year out from the election I Believe Bill Clinton's going to win Republicans are going to hold on both houses of Congress and that

a ... or you know become Twenty one age of consent\nIs that so that's just a guess\nOkay well it just seems that it's fair to me or that they would do it to the young folks and not others because

Mars ABC CBS and ... and uh NBC mhm I I think they have a very big by a I don't know of there's there's all kinds of newspapers and they're all ... all kinds of different media and all that but uh\nMost people I mean there's all kinds of polls that also say that most people do get their news from TV and they believe what they see on TV\nThat is true and I I think it's a shame [noise]\nWell I appreciate your culture and we'll see what others have to say I'm\nSo you think that people are taking their cue from the media it is true that more people than not get their news from the media from

because if he runs he will be the candidate yeah in my opinion so uh if you sat there were foreign party lose we may get a ... another candidate next time\nOK and just one thing when you had a the two candidates from the the other parties like uh the libertarian yes thing that I'm scared about that this guy gets in there and see if they have their way you can imagine\nThat the sweatshops Thirteen

agree\nSir I Believe me I Do agree\nI Am very much in the middle and I do agree I Am not able to embrace libertarian philosophy and I really really really like Harry brown use the real thing he believes in what he says I just happen not to agree with all of it\nAre two important non trivial points one is legalized drugs very bad idea in my opinion and the other is open borders\nOr we have

me that's been kind of bugging me for the last couple of weeks um I was reading an article about a high school student now with this panic from school because she gave a classmate might all\nUh I don't think it was mine all but it was an aspirin yes\nUm that's just kind of um you know kind of throw with me and I didn't why in the devil they tend to forget given an F\n... well their rule was a no student will give any other students any drug over the counter or otherwise that was the rule\nOh okay it's just that they did it affect you trained at all [noise] yes yeah\nBecause I thought I read something that a Kurd to another student in a different school that are either Tylenol or an Advil or something like that and\nExactly defended that they're going to have a well I think they found it in a locker ... and I\nThought well I can imagine you know doing it if they found pot or heroin or something like that and there but um\nI Know aspirin seems radical yeah I went on the other hand uh there there's a reason for the rules thank you for the call\nUm it it does sound a little rough but suppose the other students had had some sort of allergy to that medicine then there would have been a real problem there would've been a real problem and I suppose that's why they have the rule\nOr a little bit strict yes but ah probably proper and they wanted the school nurse to dispense any medicine west of the Rockies you're on the air hockey\nOh about yes ... in Albuquerque New Mexico yeah later on fine good I think\nTo a couple of factors off and on the past month or two I don't know if we have done a vet at any rate creating Albuquerque um the thing with a cap and Australia um my question is do they know for sure it's safe for human\nUm well it did not cover that it's always

um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and\nSo um that kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have been some money to get that a\nYoung student who had been on the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd picked someone like you or me you know right and they would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's this\nGuy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he

and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens\nOf arguing with anybody and wanted to be with the people that she'd been with her whole life and be accepted by them there's also a lot of confusion and we should touch on this because I think we should go into everything Arthur Ford himself shortly after I think it was about [noise]\nA couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his ... eyes car accident and his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide the year before\nNow what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret to do this and that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nUm the James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV [noise]\nYes and and he does a little upfront research brings it into the than says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers\nAnd found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nBut this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is in his exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics that just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just\nIt it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nShe did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote a wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to be able to be a little lost\nUm [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting pulverized uh being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Burma and she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage Coventry in in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there how close\nEngland cans are losing their island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with um never trust them\nI'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with you Churchill was the one who\nGot the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time that Stalin in America and the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great first I think if FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful\nSure I mean there's ... there's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ...\nMillion FDR it seemed and reading your book an FDR was very anxious to get a face to face was down and I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we need it style and Stalin didn't need us he was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and\nOf course we know as Hitler and it's and Stalin had to pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good they're doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to ... because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable\nIs completely unstoppable so uh of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such a\nDelusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing\nA winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and\nThey will just says well I don't care I Wanna do it\nSo styling is already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler\nHas he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and wish to get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a restaurant\nIn Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty robots or you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I I Want to back up all the minute and

I Believe in the seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts of the time and um you know I spent ten years researching this stuff\nAnd you know after you are not quite that much for sure but um there's this new information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Martha good morning welcome to coast\nHank it Richard thank you for taking my call my play the\nIdea that the ... made their money to the slave trade them for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller ah\nStarted out lighting houses with kerosene that fly that combat stumble engine that guy's a gasoline like a byproduct than that cannot days ran down these guys\nThat I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\nWell I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mentioned mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the actually see the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote it takes the courage to crush across\n[laughter]\nReally interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family ah probably it's all money so you know just kind of keep the Toomey elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but that that um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour I'd be lucky [laughter]\nBy the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to be as best they can\nYou know

author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm way Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so we as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics or talking amongst themselves\nAnd I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he\nWould pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that\nBut this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but\nAlways the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all we had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake medium would be totally surprised if it were you and you say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems that makes sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... year Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA door oil was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend uh and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them\nThat got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought
