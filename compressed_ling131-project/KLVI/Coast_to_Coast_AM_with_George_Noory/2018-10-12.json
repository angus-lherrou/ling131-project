but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nIt's gonna happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got it or it's ... it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero hour\nAnd and are newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened\nEvery Ninety years since the industrial revolution cause the greatest boom in global his\nLawn you know Harry I've had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen it didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we're we're in the same position we were coming into a\nTruth out sick kinda marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally taught and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump had that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand points reversal from down nine hundred to upper eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nI'm an we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not good to win reelection I was just going to have and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best in the\nPolls on and noticed that there were going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing pass next the next year but there is there is a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFor forty pursue we know

from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble in the economy started in two thousand a factor in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spent ... what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season it started in two thousand\nWill be probably about two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see go boom again from about twenty two twenty three all the way in two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been the sport but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states is kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nWhere our demographics or we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as to\nThe boom so we'll we'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's\nGoing to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nOn joined is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be really fun to be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump to write about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nNot tourists on let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure\nThey're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nA head of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're going to take your deposits and work in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money\nThan you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm on on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly when it happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr ... I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars for the hurricanes struck and because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here were a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work enough tax payer for having to pay for their relief\nAnd the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here uh in New York the former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people flee the state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas or formerly all red state which is now only purple a to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I'm saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies ah we're having now I'm going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative\nGoing to be huge a

E. R. dot com\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more flew an account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and got may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went too far and that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has to burst\nAnd and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nInto thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat well here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and in the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust sin if you know send period ... to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks cause things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefit of corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check ... because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they get you're right that that's much better way the point is the get everyday people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron hello Harry Good that you\nKnow hello there George and Harry him that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you're making it again just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or someplace else\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money sent her mind this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to X brokerage money or pull account if they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with theory Dunn Hi Barbara North Carolina\nFor a year okay thank you and I think yeah I just think that part of one of my questions but before I ask that a direct them I Can't even I have one of my\nParents were flying um I think I Am I'm In my head and humiliate crumble it was kind of combat comes flying\nRight yup play all about timing it's all about timing\nWhat am I going to have a moment like I'm hearing what part of it she gets answered my question like\nAbout smaller amount so my hearing that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm at a larger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected in whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account if you spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get out\nYes you're going to be less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting for those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course when when things go bad people going to hit for the positives more Iceland\nWent down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time Harry's website at coast to coast damn dot com up next a psychiatrist looks at the paranoia\n\n[noise]\nAnd now the heart radio we

field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University throughout his entire life\nHe has had many close brushes with death as well starting in the womb\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or anomalous experiences visions breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying the operations is well welcome to the program Dr many meat is on the coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders Norma first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nAdopted bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that the doctor should not be paid anything he's told by patients and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls for that so many Veterans Day that [noise] um you know\nIt's been a lot of little tribute and about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's coming back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated at something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut it's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my close fresh is that the sec to me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these close cause of death I and to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have over my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first um couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... the ... you know I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would leave me and in those days no one talked about those experiences\nBecause there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh geez oh yeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous stem cell donated pollen allergen it ... ... with more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nI just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I got leukemia ooh jeeze um\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and\nIt was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the transplant\nHuh [noise] now is the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown back into the don't you send for Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city\nAnd that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with them the darn happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and ...\nHere for them you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive in one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required his cheeks swab ... that's it\nYeah that that she thought to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang and then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know\nWe found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live\n... yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients\nGenerally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see if the ... [noise] however since I had that experience and psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common [noise] you know for example um if\nSomeone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist and like not to have these experiences while as religious people\nYou see that every one is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but uh when you said that ... what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP\nOr telepathy or the cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of visions hundred voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of sake experiences such as ESP\nUntil after the urge strongly common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... that was just thinking about\nYou right now is that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert hurricane Michael changes the panhandle for ever Florida governor Rick Scott\nThis monstrous storm devastated the Gulf Coast and our pan handle so many lives have been changed forever so many families have lost everything\nHomes are gone [noise] businesses are gone\nResidents called the destruction\nUnbelievable that I've been in Panama City over sixty years this is the worst I've ever seen in my parents had motels on the beach and it was the worst they've ever seen and we've never left for hurricane\nStorms heading out to the now over Virginia and Congress demands answers from Saudi Arabia about a journalist missing in Turkey\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham is warning there will be what he calls I bipartisan tsunami building if it turns out that Saudi Arabia was behind the disappearance of a possible murder of journalists from all ...\nAnd ... this is Fox News [noise]\n\nAnd words well what's new today on the free her radio a radio\nA perfect for decorating the house or just studying the scary mood our pumpkins ... has joke tracks with labor is why why we've got to apologize\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people ... the Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nTeen sixty four with the beach boys recorded dance dance dance with Glen Campbell playing the lead guitar intro would go on to become their twelve us how forty just\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy two James Brown Haley made so much of his audience by meeting with President Richard Nixon in the White House in endorsing him in his bid for reelection this weekend Nineteen Seventy six one wonders Walter Murphy in the big apple than went to number one on the U.S single starts with a fifth\nOf Beethoven mash up of disco classical music [noise] this week in Nineteen eighty one during a North American tour the Rolling Stone for the first two nights at the Los Angeles memorial coliseum\nDetail the are broadcasting from ... dot com studios\nDarling you\nHold on\nOn and on issues\n\n\nKnow huge\nReal on\n\nLoaded will lend you we are\nFrom somewhere out there this this coast to coast am with your ...

psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon Mandy let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased fender relative\nUm that actually happened to my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they don't tell you mentioned her name she's out in the ... and it was one study that was done in a hospital\nDying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them and they called them\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nMhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government leaders\nTo to assassinate them and them to die of heart attacks and there were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\n[noise] well that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know how they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how could we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it\nThat I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I got I I just saw these where it said\nThis is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she'd been that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate he ignored who please also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their promotions do maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the ... after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed that superstition there's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was the horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else some loss\nAnd Dr seuss in movies screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe they don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they have recovered from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nUm what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his doctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nYou have you back but\nThen then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were well yeah it works it would that work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual components life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's ...\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there are certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same event\nSo I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\nOh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five days you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight just log on to go to ... am dot com\n[noise]\n\nThis is just more of the wildlife journalism host more outdoors on these talks ...
