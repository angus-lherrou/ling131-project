on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports and need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they're being reported like liquor these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking where you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problems\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me I'm back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you check out you know charge the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you can take a look at the whole month of November by looking at say midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nYeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always\nThere's a rising and the sun is a Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other planets like for instance midnight New Year's\nComing up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own fine actually late on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kind of projects that are more martial but something with Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this was what the old idea exactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo it inside of us okay so in other words if everything depends on something\nBeing born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb if the village of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that is really taking in the first breath like the declaration of independence is usually use relieve America's Choice because it was a first\nBreath were were saying it gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that say about the potential\nOf my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in a moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month stay in your earth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate or you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month staying here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ... do it\nBecause timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it near noon his son said is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because it twenty four hours most the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instinct or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who may have been with the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but the so polarizing find which is fine rise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver you know in this

strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of thought so I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there\nUh the planet mercury which who've mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly the same spot where mine was and I knew what a chart was and when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and often underrated within the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits of progression with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince ... since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and event something happened\nUm I started going medical a Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into a all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic we're thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of a chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where no\nAnd I was born I go home and just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes gal layer and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault\nThe world went to the phony thing of astrology because they biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nNow how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWith what they didn't realize is who was the science it was taught in the University of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt\nRome greet you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December twenty nine\nNineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay more than one forty two in the afternoon in\nJersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting in my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of\nGet that information pretty quickly\nAnd you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean uh if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nWelcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did that you hope to grade you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course\nThis individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study the moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives and like instinctively this individual has a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in another ... particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual sons so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and he should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy to that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this on another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\n... you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on and other people didn't get it on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers in neurology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you a ... inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would\nYou believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein are gone D. or different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the no ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else so that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and or incarnations like in the chart\nWe're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan to hire destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun ... and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... under a marine reincarnation astrological you speaking yeah we're the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that will who they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought\nPeople would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage and twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman being able to come into the world Eleanor suspicious time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in\nOther words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing went to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go

I've been seeing a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime of Pluto\nA movement toward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn\nWhich rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of the link to hire spirit so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy\nAuthors were ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be hard it could be music anything a a hobby a craft an activity though that as deep and significant so that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on\nYou do have a wonderful moon in Virgo in in the lime and called the trying which is flowing to your son to be an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes we've been nurse or doctor were poor student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSome kind of deep seated study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car loan next one may poor Nineteen sixty nine may for Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for food\nYeah Hi thank you um my question is about Korea or money and should I moved to a different state um uh when I was born in a quiet city court\nNo where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in a way of course in he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or not I don't know okay no problem okay you said money\nThen where what state to live in which they deliver these in Cali right now\nWell first of all there is an even on my website it's called global hotspots ... where I Do this is part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals [noise] we've there's been a science for forty plus years and astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you've got to know your time of birth and then we can move\nAround from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere on the planet to understand what's good and what isn't out California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union has a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as the son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a Taurus son signed tourists\nThat's an earth sign and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your earth science and California's earth sign\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you have mercury with Vesta which is\nOne of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to do something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that and you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon\nTrying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lima to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the near future um and because you emerge reason it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection\nBut you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde power Venus which is your son sign ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah in fact I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on that note when President Trump took office it's an article on earth of course news\nIt was very strong at his inauguration it has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half and therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on\nThe chart gets over populated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously are not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\n... mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve or New Year's day to get
