bolsters briefcase almost a week after he died piece together twenty eight pieces and they concluded\nA three of them didn't know was a forgery\nA forgery yes Vince I'm I'm going to ask you to do something because in light of this news I Would say the content of the letter and I remember the content of the letter the content of the letter was in my opinion very very suspicious\nWell I well I'll tell you what I said about it at the time that it could have come straight out of the White House press office now do you have a copy of that letter and if you do you read it to us please\n[noise] [noise] uh where I have I caught you by surprise that\nJust a matter of reaching across here\nOkay well I figured somewhere you'd have that uh I'll tell you what I'll tell you know I mean\nLet me read it I have it right\nMaybe I should look at the table of contents\nAnd and I'll tell you what this is a good place fine I'll take a break it's that important I'll just give you a couple of minutes to find that\nI doubt it you got it yeah go\nI made mistakes from ignorance inexperience nova work I did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct no one in the White House to my knowledge violated any law or standard of conduct\nIncluding any action in the travel often there was no intent to benefit any individual with specific group the FBI lied and they report to the Eighteen the press is covering up the legal benefits they receive from the travel often\nA GOP has lied and misrepresented its knowledge and its role uncovered of prior investigation\nThe officers office plotted to have excessive costs incurred taking advantage cocky an HR the public will never believe the innocence of the Clinton and they're loyal staff\nThe wall Street Journal editorial editors live without consequences I was not meant for the job\nOr the spotlight public life in Washington Here ruining people is considered a sport\n\nAnd that's it that's it\nThe part that really grabbed me was they I it just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believed the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed all up and said you know he said any time you have a note that suddenly appears when there needs to be such a duck and then it seemingly benefits ...\nIt's just the immediate cause for concern\nAnd of course here you have so many destroying the statement that all the experts believe that the statement had been taken from other documents that he had ... maybe had Britain and other contact and had been put together\nA good word you will always try to imitate known writing\nSo they're trying to Fort well of course of course so you what\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because Vince Foster apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for good by world\n\nAnd yet that sounded like kind of a summary note nevertheless I mean some are rising everything to this point and with some something in mind without having that suicide it did sound kind of final summation of the failure or however you want to look at it\nThere at the press conference there were a number of reporters the number of TV networks I don't think it ran on any of the television network\nWell there we come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story he had been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out of their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC\nOh really yeah\nHow could they possibly ignore evidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS to choose to ignore it or protecting its sixty minutes division but what about the other is and what about the Associated Press and what I Want you know I mean those are the press\nThe major news\nOutlet the country and they didn't send a reporter and then they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a full news story or at least a dispatch I mean here Reuters did a major dispatch twice the length that they usually do on these type of story\nAnd the a P uh editors from Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story or they save it stick to paragraph literally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in in Washington\nA panel of experts has declared that the foster notice and notify the government can vote otherwise blah blah blah\nBut this is now doing all of three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come to that old OK\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park police totally mishandled that had nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like there are any note to one document\nTo make its certification which is exactly what the park police and the FBI get\nSo the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I quote in my article what you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and the former head of the question document unit the girl thank you know he wanted a minimum of ten documents\nWell the only that was funny that you know the liberal\nYeah vi crime lab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime land\nWell who knows they may be a lot of crime going on there\nAs\nWell stick in with a note for a second the declaration than it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell there's a couple of reasons why first of all there was a great quality for fishing because the note\nIs found in a briefcase the search the police at that they were suspicious of the fact that that briefcase search by empty enough pound looked at it\nSecond it um benefited or people at the White House and took the onus off approving the suicide third ... born and apparently the experts at any time you have a document question document that is corn\nMutilated crumple from things build on it it is often times an effort to make the comparison\nDifficult difficult sure they'll already\nYou have a primary ... cases that the English experts at\nA physician then you look at the no\nAnd the first of all the note if you look at the no which we have a photocopy of and we had a huge blow up a right and comparing you can see that they did not match that the way he the stroke structures are done the flow the slant of the letters is not the same\nSo then from make clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nWell it is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say the let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top go down at the bottom\nYou've rounded out and then the last stroke is going over the next letter the end of the stroke\nBut ... born here will not do it that way he'll write the line down he'll stop the stroke it might take the bow of the letter B. and start from the top and bring them around and you can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter of beef for example\nUm was done in three stroke structured strokes\nUnlike foster who had a very tenuous in the style of writing uh-huh what she's saying oh we had a dolphin document that week or two or three different fourth\nI'm so very very clear that we ah that that that they will eat isn't a match\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point like you like me\nLike anybody who's got anything to do was saying what we're saying right now but\nThis has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step and so you're asking a couple of things aren't you you want based on this report you want more coverage you want\nAnd he said that it's not a Mac it was a it was a forgery and he could see how the Fort ...\nWrote the document because before ...\nNever know how someone exactly right how their stroke well\nAll right hold it right there where the bottom of the hour we'll be right\nWith Chris Ruddy\nAnd will tell you how to get hold of the Associated Press\nIs

there yeah All right good Chris this really\nIt was a blockbuster I mean this is uh to me as you said earlier this makes Watergate hailed by comparison there you're talking about a third rate burglary for some the various political purpose\nHere you might be talking about the least obstruction of justice in the body was moved and the story was manufactured\nOr murder\nRap whatever it is it doesn't it even or even if justice with the bird and the FBI didn't use their proper procedures and investigating the park belief used an examiner to certify the document that that never ah with certified as a handwriting expert\nUh\nSo obviously no one really cared to properly investigated that Mr ... one of the experts formerly with the New York city police department was on the house committee for assassination and he was the one that\n... that are found the palm prints of Lee Harvey Oswald on the rifle but uh he is an expert in late fingerprint\nA note was torn for the audience and the reporters today it's twenty eight pieces and\nAnd they were shown how many fingers had to come in contact with different piece of paper Mr ... said his statement that this is consistent the fact that they had no fingerprint for no late impression on these papers is consistent with the person who tore it having one gloved\n[noise] [noise] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic stories so the Associated Press now you've you've me what you can I knew this is touchy territory Chris writer\nWhile the eight paint today promised a number of people that call on the media world here in in Washington announced where that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know a short story but it would be a story\nAnd when people were calling up yeah we did it we're doing it or we did it while we find out what did it meant was to paragraph three paragraphs at the end of a very long article on white water and Senate hearing\nA witness that was important Marcy on the night foster died he came in he was the first one to spot forced his car and he told the FBI in the park police that there was a Hispanic man sitting next to last his car watching it a menacing him with very menacing looks followed him if he or an edited the park and\nThis um witness left immediately um\nPark police never went and visited him to interview him they spelled his name wrong in the hit the police report\nOr when the FBI visited with him the FBI civil who was the man that gave you manage thing look it's a Mexican American man\nAnd the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify would be unable to identify on the line up or a composite sketch this man was\nWell there it is and the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch of the man he saw a park the FBI out and out lie in their report\nOut this would maybe be a mistake if it happened one when we have so many instances in this case\nYou know there were two witnesses later in the park that sought to man and then around forced his car they sat in on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to but the hood up just before the body was that\nAll right look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and um you're beginning to now camp you know if in other words if the worst case scenario is true\nOh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgery thing then you're tampering with forces that have already\nGone an awful long way here and have a ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter\nI'm I'm not convinced that you're safe\nUm well you know there's there's\nRisk involved in anything you do I've taken those risks and will continue to take those risks because this is a very important story and uh uh you know the trip for half the flow where they may they fall on me that I'll just take that take that the when it comes\nYou know um I take it you've given some amount of thought to this though I mean what would\nLook if in fact a this was a murder I Am one of the prime people behind expose again\nYeah I guess that's what I'm saying\nWell look and look what you know here Mike Wallace did this teeth and I think I said this to you on the last time you know my brother called me up afterwards ... ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never want it to a big job on Wall street type person\nAnd I just watch this and that makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah\nTook a pay cut to continue doing a story um so what do you say I mean how do you how do you argue against that Mike Wallace knew that they knew that I never reported that foster was left handed a first that with the Boston Globe\nBut I was going to be held responsible for every era that any paper ever done in this case\nI'm only in the Cape to people out there that do look into it that\nI'm On the right track and only indicates to me I'm On the right track when they have to make such a ... near one Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old at the dean of American television journalism has to bring down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows that I'm having an impact\nWell ... if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is and I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control of very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but\nYou you could almost begin to believe that could be so because of the associated ... abreast under reporting because of sixty minutes going after you as they did\nI'm an because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and well I it's not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it sends a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nWell or the king media\nI don't know if everyone but came media the leader of sixty minutes elite program you know Don you it has gone on a record producer a minute thing that he helped get when Clinton was elected\nAfter the Jennifer Flowers thing that he edited that tape and such a way that he remained recast the candidate um you know it it seems very close association with the ministry of former Clinton campaign advisor\nTo the end of the new recap\nUh you know these these connection with\nThe Clintons are not good at governing uh but they're very good at dealing with handling\nA seat in is spinning and [noise] All right look I'm going to end the interview here and I'm going to give out the number to the Associated Press again Chris watch your back my friend\nI appreciate it and also anyone that would like to get a compendium of my

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence ended the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're originally let out a gym that I think it's kind of you if you can test and said yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying well for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway is that right\nAt ... at the at the new wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck out for their belief all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the the Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see\nA kind of bumps like that or is it just is like is it I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nOh massive massively I mean some some business is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more of a ... year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which will never go well\nI Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there and they can make their entire year in the week that the teacher is open and I I Would never have gas shops that are just hoping for one month in in Salem\nYeah but and but other but what they're realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house open to the monster museums ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round as failing grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want tourists to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like ... year round the only other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance the er the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time 'cause they're just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic tables and climbing on\nThem and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts that do that there's there's on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... ...\nI think the train cars so that's really good at ... at ten pm\nYeah I Believe it than it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train and it takes some time so by midnight around an\nErotic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ...\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad really bad though\nWhere they got to get them up before the ... or maybe they're doing the real wishing happened after all the tourists lead Jay double the locker\nOr and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and may have Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts who is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter] All right I have a\nGreat night but I'm checking off one when I go to Ross will in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween of starting on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast am All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget\nThe men from the train next on coast to coast am this is he in\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression\nOf sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflame the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily\nAnd at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call and letting the courts\nDo their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story\nOf the men from the train [noise] uh but [noise] this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime before her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad\nRules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are\nDead in a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham that not\nRun for your life or all because of a\nStory seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate about who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experiences on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you\nSend out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's so many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things have ever happen not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today so\nI ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nEven though the story is over a hundred years old\nIt's still not

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um\n[noise] there's oh there are clear geographic pattern and the murders if one of hers just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland a so that that would be a link between them the uh\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve but the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um uh\nThe uh by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had\nBeen achieved that had begun to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and I had a very infant pile stage\n[noise] men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer tracking this story than required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which\nAs you point out had been a they had the dots hadn't even been conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person than ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year at the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose\nFrom in Nineteen eleven Nineteen twelve which would runner and he was killing a lot of people but the earlier crimes ... what we did was say\nLook this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in Nineteen alive and there have to be earlier crime so let's try to find them now have gotten ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got ... nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year or so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all of them are ... I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and\nBreathing hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder when they read his first crime reveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years honeybee out and start a series of crimes and he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd it is fresh crime happened to occur the the biggest newspaper towns in the country where New Yorker and and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last ... last murders and the series so are we\nIs just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype\nCrushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successive Lee after that it is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was\nCarrying a gun all the time after about Ninety five the ah I think that he while he use an ax to\nCommit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could product him but um it was not what he was trying to do but it is why he would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... lead all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answered the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our\nOf our ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories\nAre about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but they are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to\nTalk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm\nObsessive reader ... by the way the last book I read was the real crime but with the real world leader a it's a book by um [noise] ... ah I Believe it's Weinstein I could have a last name or\nOr the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry\nKnow there should be a it'd be it and\nAnd one of the things I've learned from reading that is the white American ... who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because uh ...\nWhat I just talked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the or if you don't get from\nSports I mean as I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand that but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\n... hang on to that thought on crime stories as this world picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed at ... am this is Ian\nGo knocking the Beatles revolving her from the top of the charts\nAlso this week in Nineteen sixty six the beach boys good vibrations made its debut on the U.S singles charge written by Brian\nWilson and my love the track was recorded over six weeks in four different Los Angeles studios and it costs them over sixteen thousand dollars a recording engineer with leaders say the last ... sounded exactly like the first six weeks earlier this week in Nineteen Seventy six Bob Seeger releases his ninth studio album\nNight new it's his first with a silver bullet band a group of Detroit area musicians that helped launch the you're used to the mainstream singles included the title track main street in rock 'n' roll never for\nIts personality sexes online and on the air you saw five sixty Kaomi I ... and I heard when you\nWalk out on all four corners and author arrive on than rocket for foreigners say five guys puffing directly it off\nThe ceiling sounds of a synagogue shooter in Pittsburgh I'm don't Walters Fox News police releasing the radio calls in the moments of the massacre\n[noise] oh you're you're fading out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nAre fading out new can of that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime at night\n[noise] the thing that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about don't normally talk about the man trying I didn't make a deliberate and thoughtful entry into the subject\nI just got her like a\nA I was I was a documentary about the murders and all this guy called\nLiving with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary him far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was in that in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing which is that it's relatively obvious that the murders are a part of a serious so I started going to put an hour and to and you're trying to learn more about the series but the the our became\nA week the week actually became five or six years\nOr so I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nIt shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is\nYeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is that true crime [noise]\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution that we've tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and\nSo they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years leader in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened maybe some closure\nI'm On my own exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they pay that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah\nWas a a a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of crime\nEngine and he had always believed that uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nHave always believed that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book that in our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct yeah\nIt was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about it\nBut it was it was a shy and he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that ban hadn't actually gotten away with it was this other fellow I I don't know why it was important to him\nTo go out I understand for the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it I'm ... I've I've I don't know a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\nYou know think about could go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all all good books or church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the story was powerful to me\nBut I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a whether they are or what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live\nOr people in urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small\nTowns hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people have our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night\nAll of the things that that happened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately if a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ...\nInverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or the um the things that people age\nOr the way the houses were constructed during their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... and ... there what is it that always sticks with me that I looked at that point you're just back there and that has to do with the the taco in the case of taco invented that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd an entire community um a\nPickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that weren't even on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickle deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a\n... it's it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean if you would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that tell you an American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important than a crime story and that is what kinds of stories are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there is a ... a killer on the railway tickets take us through what happened in the ...\nOf an item of June nine Nineteen twelve\nThat's right there [noise] um it still has not forgotten or many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but it's some of it it's still quite well remembered [noise]\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you would have narrowed down

I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the event ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while you may have had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and he says he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time with the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried a\nIt carried a banker pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents screwing about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point what year had he gone into the navy do you know we don't know no I'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers\nAnd they they just you know the ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken\nTruly makes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopathic have no fear of over ... known norm had do not have normal fear and one thing with a parent about this the ... the ... on the train is that from his crime is it ... it was not\nEven not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller and maps and the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about ah this this crime and it when that guy\nIllinois and [laughter] and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be ride but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity is\nSo we moved on and printed the book but\nThere is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers you're coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also it was quite a bit of ...\nThe two uh and I may throw in a strange question about the bus didn't Straggler that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give you the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is the impact\nSign up now for coastal zone or free email newsletter get it today at coast to coast am dot com\n[noise]\n[noise] three\nYears ago making a murderer became led to a TV show of\nForce of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice and it was also completely death on it and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this Stephen ...

talking about the man from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer\nA and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot it means he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or in longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about those people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder\nBut there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks um\nI've got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence from a ... like when the ...\nYeah what\nAny of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the less murders were committed they are it it's still\nIt's still around and has been presented with a guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right uh you know what I'm middle Gary ...\nNo way down it disappeared ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much go at all it it it might have worked for the road because he got every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where there's lay overnight or something like that but a\nTicket for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might agree she that hey you know actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... what ... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal record murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed a if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers
