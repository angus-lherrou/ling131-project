one of the central voices in the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field in the intention experiment and the way it is the power of age limits the editorial\nDirector what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn walking back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing ones last autumn and we\nJust calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when the several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or the other groups you know the category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep that uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about six piece intention experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the most violent place in America which is believe it or not a U.S a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ... and we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor of statistics look at this from University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster\nTo purifying water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you\nKnow of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effect\nDoes that the trend of the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has is good or record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together\nThere is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow he'll think the experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras in nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries\nI was working with a guy like the Deepak of the middle east and also very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive\nWill that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individual for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old\nWho tried to commit suicide through self off of forty foot structure after is he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend\nAnd he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLuca better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated\nBut here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nWho worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona the noted say colleges and Jessica are too is a very well known professor statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an archaic around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocols that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists and\nAnd I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if\nYou just do it a week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nNow loom the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the town of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures somebody who'd feeling a sense of the static one\nAnd when we compared these signatures when the scientists who work at the doctors said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at other things like\nThe work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monk any static prayer they had an identical brainwaves signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a few female after my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was twelve minute video for me\nTo do when we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of each and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable when Mick Jagger ... linked up for you that coast to coast day uh ... dot com sober other books the bond\nThe intention experiment and\nSign up now for ... or ... ... email newsletter today at ... dot com\nAway are we\nShare I'm Carmen Roberts frightening tails up survival during hurricane Michael\nThe roof ripped off um it was all that out of there and when the way it was like pulling out of that little room\nThat man and an elderly neighbor took shelter in a bathroom shower and Michael hit the Florida Panhandle yesterday with one hundred fifty five mile an hour winds\nDowned trees killed at least two people ... near Tallahassee and an eleven year old girl in Seminole county Ga near the Florida line the sharp sell off in Wall Street and the Dow plunging eight hundred thirty one point spreads to Asia Stockton China pledged five percent today in Japan they fell down\nNearly four percent stocks in Europe already down one percent yesterday's downturn was broad based\nTechnology Dr ...

or group doesn't intention for she hears from the hotel says we accidentally overcharged you buy exactly the money she was overdrawn\nI'm somebody else was down to her last two hundred dollars she wanted to set up a website she had a port wine staying and wanted and was wanting to do a Web site and set up a business to help other people not feel bad about their birth marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly hears from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it it has convinced me it's not just look it's not just happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found him as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger power vague you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical\nTo a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university um has their nervous scientists\nWe're planning\nStudy with their biology department to looking at the immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest nerve the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you\nKnow we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending loved to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be your mother that would be an interesting for\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror of what is that\nWell the mirror effect to me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly ah I asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network\nIn my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after they participated in a piece experiment on line became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses and they're co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nThat to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lines were more peaceful\nIn a way that's probably the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happens to the people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna
