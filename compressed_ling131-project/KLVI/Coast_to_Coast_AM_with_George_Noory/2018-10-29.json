I mean I've done five books now I'm On this phenomena foreign the men in black and one of the women in black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like

George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them how to FBI falls open on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI but yes they have these experiences with highly ins but they\nTold the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or governments very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's a defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey now\nIn the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada as I say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive and it revolved around my my Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nOn this they should become known as the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal air force I sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised and security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of by this encounter with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most challenging and intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world that Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold the UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about states it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact ease and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of amusement well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen when you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA sciences UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski

L. vi [noise]\n\nWelcome back Christopher white received his PHD in religious studies from Harvard University where he studied religion and culture he's interested in religion and science spirituality get on church religion\nNew religious movements electronic media and popular culture and there's currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're gonna catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise]\nNo it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences whatever whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of problem my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this on the move here in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how are these sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remain strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of I\nGuess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they are pretty high numbers in America um believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real\nSense of relief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and and the fence and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like dark matter\nOr or dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multiverse or thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery in and wonder I think those concepts are sort of\nUh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time to ignore me George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other reality um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just\nSay worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going to another ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean\nWe have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nOr in this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter]\nAnd the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nFourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment are talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible

story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he and his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's ... and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality ... story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he he embraces map Vatican geometry as a kind of a and he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nBe able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and he writes these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know sometimes give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that can happen or does that happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one sided audio what how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well also in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made of that of that book but she talks about time slip some and and time travel\nUm and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on as as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what climate is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we had a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense at time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know I find out a number of counter to to things to say but one of them was that\nUm the ways that we experience time it's probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block right are we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our path and in our in our president and and our future and in the earth's future and in our son future [noise]\nAnd and all of our defending future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics [noise] um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it just after my book but you can also look at Brian Greene for he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talked about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices and fell on\n'em so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in a block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension the dream and stuff you can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments\nAnd Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and we could talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody everybody sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and they followed he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and passed it on I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I get on the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences\nOr to talk about the science is a sharman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we are discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away like listen to the break you\nKnow you can get show updates and connect with other coup spins when you joined the ...

summer\nHigher dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to de world pulled them up um could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab a simple is up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and the and habits booking flat land so\nYes people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as as kind of the higher dimensional objects that than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal leaps good coexist with a scientific scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experienced like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also\nHave scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices in the book I'm\nTalking about what the meaning of these events are and and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret what's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people\nWho have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on\nAnd and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about to talk about reality so I think\nI think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right to have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to\nHe went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the books I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nAh well I mean human humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time ... would be an example reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to\nTo reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right on ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the gyms to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely they're all different\nAll different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people projector consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that does that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a ...\n... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know an flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in and flat land let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle and he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line um every everyone and flat land\nCan just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of this two dimensional\nWorld up into higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full mentioned allergy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at flat line he can see for the first time not just lines that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right and it said let's say he has a friend who's a triangle\n'em all he saw before was their line coming towards him but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the trial you can see inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have uses the say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power is a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire the mentioned we look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look down\nOn your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out you know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside that are run by you could see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um so you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nUm and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talk about\nHaving this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things I never saw before [noise] so so yeah and so\nMaybe remote viewing is a a you know is higher dimensional phenomena but I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it I'm that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and and the epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences and some parents Paris psychological phenomena like like feeling\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in a ... interview and it's just you know he's a trailblazer in in discussing that those experiences in so many people have had and trying to put it in context that this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those experience yeah\nI looked at his his books to ah he's he's really interesting I Love the book um I looked at his books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the epilogue of the book and that the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found\nIs that people do use this kind of language you know they it's almost like they talk like the square and flat land [laughter] as as a character you know the characters suddenly lifted off of\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um\nYou know suddenly there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm an end the dimensions of the room changed and shifted and others talk about being able to see like in a hospital setting right\nDon't think
