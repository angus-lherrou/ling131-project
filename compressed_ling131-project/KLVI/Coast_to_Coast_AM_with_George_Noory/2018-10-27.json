that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects and some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Steele and we'll go and joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd\nIf you go to coast to coast am dot com you

the carousel\nOn the top of the website it goes to goes to um dot com and that this struggle to play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it 'cause I Love to get back to this coming up later on in the show wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City there are there but at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero treat a candidate suspense or eat less than half of now

just get back to that later on but you can go see the whole\nThe story and coast to coast am to come and look at the video\nAnd then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencil I I don't know you you believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up\nOn coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who's here the end of life as we know it ominous\nNews from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy\nA he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day it was gonna say I had my son was born in Boston and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that and that's why a ... a a\nA later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media\nAnd you are amongst I think in the elite group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to tell me and\nI Know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in the ... very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she just love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated\nGood morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um\nOnto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life of you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their actions and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real\nOr in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's

various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical lights are on this planet is like the weather that was due uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe're in the drama of traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow were to find the natural\nOrder of things and you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nThat one yet none nice I forget what it was\nThe commercial was margarine night it was very mired in a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the de ... thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this\nGuy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but [noise]\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church\nOf artificial intelligence and you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang goal which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go\nYou know ... you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall e and\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once post about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day ... singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get then the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\n... are like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know\nThe old saying if you don't use it lose if you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I quote one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how easy would that be All right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think

I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement called the trans human movement where as you say they are the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable a trend human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little down side\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms zap them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we're mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have right now these are these are arms\nThat he can move with it they're they're wired\nMine and I and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even end um [noise]\nEven in a military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there you know where you know write it get it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella government to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that the I\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I I think that\nI mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence yeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to a ... that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one better [laughter] than inevitable you it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities\nBut I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors in effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the coalition a group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon uh using their own that\nThis is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain the question then becomes do you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that's basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... it in some ways you know [laughter] ... that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we had our just still the same\nYou know so all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor conundrum not the Terminator conundrum but Sarah Connor tuna ... which means\nIf you can't win a conventional war because you're over welcomed by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism\n... you know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nEr and his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to\nPut a a a a new head an old head on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's put that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those\nHalloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there is this is this is one of those ... nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\nYeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nUh by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships a prior communities\nEffort the security of our country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nHer that kind of a refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's connected\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than a billion Internet\nOf things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show anything in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and the police started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang onto the thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join in the ministry\nThe end of life as we know it might go deal in next uh coast to coast am in for George ...

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat they police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things that\nA a a cousin that was being born in the family wouldn't have a soul because she was a test tube babies\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make them they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like like\nDo they work [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into our DNA F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense than just ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the topic the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be\nYeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think you you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation it talks about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance fine\nIt says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stones to come down and in and cover them up\nAre they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved and mark\nHello this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse or some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jive with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating ah and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other\nIs you know it does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a medical experiment that people talk about a lot it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it\nIn the form of a big computer server and the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot\nBut get so complex\nAnd soul yawn\n... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I think that\nThat or from saying or for the crush souls of the people it's dumped on an ... you know getting ... getting itself coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after the average you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like try and everything stop you know the ... a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop\nAnd oh fuck it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so I ... through that actor is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast saying David\n[noise] hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by June ... artificial intelligence\nA new one

dialysis is on kidney machines and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful um they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out ... and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore sight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney from I don't think we need to create these by merit\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell\nOr ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left

jar it'd be didn't here's the story\nOn coast to coast am wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City era our spirits but at least that's the theory\nBehind paranormal activity witness that fine zero treat a can of its dispensary what's going to happen now behold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy going that's next to

the surveillance camera\nWith all the jar\nDid that this happened watch the Penn it's completely skill and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move and if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law that they had many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou as a form of ... to ... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there is no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video and especially in the fact that we were really got me was because it's a candidate shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in on open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to

that there are where nothing because they sleep right or you know we can try to play God but I I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not charge us all I have to say\nWell that's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that so peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say then it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were\nWhy wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have a ... problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human than they have less of a soul I'm so I'm not I'm with ya in theory well I'm with you in theology on soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest tube babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I and world apologize first of all for not less in for five years I don't want to get too much into it right\nUm after less ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... her saying I'm a reviving manner or would it have anything to eat ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore\nOur current situation right now we have there are a lot of people story not first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know piling compiling supplies for\nThree years to come for for that is families with multiple wives with multiple showed her with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not these\nAre usable and\nWe don't know even with training we don't know if\nThe supplies what's known somebody who was in a cave or in a whole or in a sketch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt your on your way to I'm falling scare myself not to\nA consumer companies suppliers but just chew on her myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to\nGive her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any knowledge of how to use the supplies are just hear somebody could even his they themselves\nThat interested you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive that could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how to use the supplies that are stored up in these codes are or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I ... I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just really be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix\nOr there's this series called uh like the men with three wives your three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife\nAnd then the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab and um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but ah yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid\nA done is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have yeah\nAnd you know I got a kick out

south we're looking ... what else is going to happen that we're missing we're missing all this has gone on purpose were missing something what is your opinion on that\nWell it's an interesting claim that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I\nI think that you'll always see migrations in the long history just bring up the Bible again\nThis is that we're all immigrants read the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that we you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories we're both from people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging

I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north um while we're so busy looking south and east is that was that part of your

it be science or whether it be a viable for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible as something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the estate religions from the middle east began their roots what Bible and polluting the Korean the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament\nAnd well and the new this in the new ... the the current estimate yeah I mean the\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up\nWith a so many of the stores in

and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they would you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future as far as he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look

that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that\nIt starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what the murder stories still do what I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill\nBut actually the word that's often used uh the Arabic word is that Jesus was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it that he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about it\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that

I'm always thinking along spiritual line or when the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I ... I'm interested in my book called the ... of Jesus yeah I'm\nFrom the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah I think it was published and or like you know eight\nUm apparently with what they say according to the introduction of ... says it was kind of transcribe written transcribed by Levi Dowling\nWould transcribe it from a classic record\n... also known as God for book of remember if there's another way of putting it [laughter] I'm fascinated with this book because it is her role in many ways for the for gospel um in in describing the life of Jesus and also covers like that so called missing years of his life [noise]\nA highly ... ... years or so [laughter] um but it does talk about the different ages and that is full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus calmer the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm a I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ that I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with Quakers and I'm fascinated with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age where they've got to be a current age began if their disagreement about\nThat and so yeah ours is that I'm the editor and I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're ... I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or in this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise\nBecause we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah\nI think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that otherwise would be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I ... I couldn't remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time the missing so called years I'm ... because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those are the only one I'm familiar with recovery it right here um I did want to wrap it up quickly a lot of could go after about her book I wanted to say um I\nAgree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier whatever color ...

book that I think you will love hearing the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects as some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen will join us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can

the carousel on the top of the website it goes to ... am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get back to this coming up later on in the show roll it in\nDowntown Oregon City here are very just like at least that's the theory behind\nParanormal activity witnessed that finds hero treat candidates dispensary behold if you dare

later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am to come\nAnd look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on\nOkay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news\nFrom the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's\nFan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day as good as my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science reporters\nPeople who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific how me and\nShe's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen if she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this is enough to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America hunting hunting Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I Walk with me had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um [noise]\nWhat I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto it very realistic rope so that Larry King [laughter] can er can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is gonna be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like cryogenic once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their accents and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to\nCaptured them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nAnd then as I said on the Harvard where our physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be and I were in the wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested in like ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my faith very very seriously it's so when I say we\nNeed
