to breast cancer research foundation by making an inside guinea hen Kades minute I'm saying ... everything\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts\nAnd some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nTheir work on them for on people for a while usually these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of\nNegative emotional energy strong or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments in so doing negative\nSpirits and so they are or attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and\nSold demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is sick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizens deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing\nThat I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free so I Would say that I'm an independent priest is ...\nFreeze exercises I don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal courageous I wasn't touching anybody anyway is really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the homes for the times that come into the home the sense of\nFamily that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's ... maybe a professional but have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner and then first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exercise is an every religion not the only one\nThat are qualified extra systems just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I keep a call up and say well like I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives\nUm I keep contact with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars\nAnd around those stars are planets and there are the universe as I said before on on one of my appearances but the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with

or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago I did a free night and a century or the agenda that haunted mansion very famous I won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgain three years and years and years you all invitation I finally\nThey talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms they're beautiful you know and\nSo\nWas actually set up for a ghost hunters to go in and uh with are quitting and and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people didn't believe in goes had you know on a couple of ... their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying and most hunting room of oh they gave me it was actually the nicest room to but\nThe first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get cars people on it and\nI was in there you know by myself and there was a very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she it was called the golden rule\nAnd it went up to get my business card and she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know I just you know forget it\nWent to get my cards paid no attention I said you know this place is really haunted and the third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite me\nPeople home negative spirit's just they will get\nTo know that gets you later so sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I was four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just\nLooking now I'm used to ... spears can assume any shape they want so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately for what this thing was doing was it was singing and ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear a loud and clear just horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I was to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up\nImmediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just learn\nAn extra sisters not safe I don't go into homes and\nUh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely beyond the client I did report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clearly not do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit and silk people\nCalling me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped you know very very

five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around six people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have\nTo look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on business or a house\nAnd so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and\nSo negative emotional energy attracts negative spirit and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think and are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove\nThe negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments for lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful but I mean\nThink of the moon energy just\nElated and so people become uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's a good mix them since ... motion energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to

gets a free any of that or could be seeing things from the other side sometimes\nYou know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems or depression anger issues unhappiness ah overconfidence\nAll sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and\nBeing able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate death but actually working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries it's even happened to me once you know I I woke\nUp one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time and I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power suddenly light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know have looked at and you know get some light medication for it is it the\nDemonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark romas that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and essentially that is very connected to the physical realm maybe the physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is\nIt possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the trip pants turtle like I go to the other side gets\nOff drugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen Ninety is asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said when I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see her still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's\nNot my job you don't have time for the spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me\nI work for them my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch he's going to he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy and the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's possessed or anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold to actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nYou every year you bland you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get rid of them George\nI Am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported that the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it you\nKnow and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey you bought your website would you

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and once in a looser tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr ... in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's not something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in the in that case\nThat never came up but I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou don't go okay where are you are\nI'm engaged in ... um I had a um a thing and then I couldn't believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little bit to engage them and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf God was real or if the devil we know all this you know and I started reading the Bible and and uh\nSo I got to the point when I was out of jail whenever there's a a ... and I was like ... ... you know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to\nBelieve I so I it started at ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened then I\nI started seeing these little things like with people like a Beagle like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them right and it seemed like everybody in when he had friends he everything he did he touch was known\nI mean you have a one like in in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's one kid he didn't have none okay now these kids couldn't get up and go oh it's a glass of water without knocking over something breaking it it's something told me that\nHe was going to get an angel [laughter] but he just didn't have one at that time and um I Believe that it was kind of me just to show me that you know how it works warning or you know the men who I bought in church even though\nI tell my uncle about it and he told me you know you could go to church or playing stuff no and I'm so we go to church but why would they church I won't eat them and I started the he will will be angels like\nIn the early on in the church all over the place all of them\nAround it you know it looks like there was a state of behind the ...

miss miss him dearly\nWell he's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yup absolutely tell me about the watch\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a wide range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nThat is their mission\nAnd along the way they brought with them they're ascension teachings that the the ... are very clear that some of the watchers brought in various crafts and technologies with him that clearly taught humankind how to use various tools and and other implements but along the way they also\nAnd this is a big beef that the church has with the watchers they taught the secrets of heaven and the secrets of heaven are how humans can transform into angels\nRide the cosmic conduit into well it's God's throne and that's the really big question right there George why would any why would the church have a problem with this why does the establishment church have a problem with a group of beings coming to earth and teaching humans to become angels\nYou would think they would walk them\nYou would think they would welcome at the problem is is that you cut out the church in this scenario you have no need for the pope's in the priest and the whole church establishment because in fact the church doesn't teach you\nCan do it on your own right\nYou can do it on your own and that is the big question can humans\nTake it upon themselves to perfect themselves as the term to become more whole to become more holy to become more complete if you answer no then chase them as demons chase them is giants if you answer yes\nAnd you really you now you're you're getting into the innermost esoteric secrets of the most closely guarded secrets of all human kind the secrets that the day whatever government or new world order type authority you subscribe to these are the secrets they do not want you to know about these are the secrets of the aluminum Audi ultimately\nWell you mentioned something to is there any evil it all connected with the watchers\nWhat there is and and perception I mean the the the the scenes were absolutely clear in their writings that there are two currents or forces of the watchers one was represented by the arcane journal Michael is also sometimes referred to as milk cheese a duck\nWho is who established the priesthood which Jesus was a member of the other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ\nAnd they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of the devil on your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts we can actually become angels\nAnd it's an amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from of several years ago these are the highest order of angels and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the Renee sound so it was a belief was developed that the the Sarah from or actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book of papers describes the the heavenly thrown a God referred to a sigh on and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this I'm going well who are these people ... and ... what did they know how did they perfect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go and do well in God's throne and can I ask how can I and that's what started me on this real path of of trying to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n[noise]\nWell I never knew I had my my garden and I never knew there were only in my room and in my feeling\n\n\nYou dont need now I Know\n\nYou\nWell you never
