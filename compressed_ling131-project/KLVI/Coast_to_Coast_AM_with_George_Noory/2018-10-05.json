it goes so flying through the audience that touching people and and uh\nUh we had a\nA you know all kinds of the gimmicks the nurses in attendance and uh you know prize giveaways and I'm a lot of shtick a lot of corny stuff\nUh but those shows used for a while they travel and it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because you know the the theaters didn't want to give up your eight o'clock movie or their ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are flow walling they would they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie\nAnd they they they would rent the theater out a after hours and they would show these uh shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted an a and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they didn't have matinees for kids to 'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out and they would have ... and ghost made out of a ... that were just didn't phosphorus\nAnd [laughter] and they would\nThey would uh you know they would have these chains that would be wrapped through the bleachers and they were rats with them back and forth and it would make all the chairs vibrate and they'd all these great uh you know that they would put the they were put weird the strings and ice water and\nThrow them out in the audience and they go down to the back of people shirts and people will be feeling it's cold\nNoodle going down the back of their shirt you know um there was so many fun kind of carnival type\nGimmicks that these guys did and they would go from town to town town and sometimes they do three movies back to back um with all these great gimmicks there'd be a magician and sideshow act you know people putting nail through their nose and all that stuff\n[noise] what's the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember without\nA job so lovely absolutely I think that that did have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOf people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen a you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also think because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of a ... thing that they can go into with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little skin or something [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you know people who who met them met each other is sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults and I've heard\nAs I've I've seen that that I've seen the shadow cast in the stage for a performance that goes along with the movie perform and very very different markets all over the country\nAnd it over and over again I flew people who have met at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely find your people if you if you really are into that move\nHouston, Texas

one other thing who ... horror movies that really scared me and now they are still like to see one occasionally\nOkay and they're not my favorite\nBut I was about ten years old at my grandmother's house everybody was in bed and I had turned that he'd be done very lowly lay on the floor but to be from it it would be able to hear it but where everybody was sleep you know it was called a black Sunday\nOh yes with Boris Carla\nActs on right I remember that what was your other one called Black Christmas or something like that\nThat was why Christmas a with a that was a bomb or who went on to direct a Christmas Story [laughter] but the white Christmas\nUh there was a killer that was terrorizing sorority sisters who all lived in the same house and he was calling them from inside the house\nAh that's repeat that's creepy\nUh and uh but uh there was also yeah it's it's a very creepy film a really well made structure or from John facts and it's amazing in it and I'm a template for a lot of those kind of movies from Seventy\nAnd like I said that guy went on to make quirky you went on to make a Christmas Story or a lot a lot of other films and different genres\nBut somebody well some of these movies Mr ... are are creepy they're not pure horror but there ... there was one with the uh Beau Bridges I Believe yeah and uh his his wife\nWent in to a fast food place or like a like a quick shop a and never came back out he couldn't find her and apparently a truck driver had kidnapped her um and I was just a really\nWell done movie and you know you know I'm not\nThat Iraq sounds

[noise] well I\nStarted when I went and rebellion head in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with being somewhere I shouldn't have done what somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time in the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit\nBy a drunk driver room\nBody a motorcycle and\nUm I had a real tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that I get it any way that contract that says more than just their physical bloom\nAnd then I went home to him and they had talked about passively amputated my leg and I lay there and I use\nMy imagination to visualize my immune system healing me\nAnd I was you know really aware of the tangles up my leg you know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience new ... you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... Japanese and being a good NPR assist which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas\nI think so I don't really remember them on on it but I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on the kitchen\nTable and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense drinking\nI drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness somebody\nOnce you were wrong I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raise their left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was to lure Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked at all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot in the style Jeff for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motive motorcycle accident airborne heights\nReally yeah well he told me weird cause you must remember the the the street oh I don't I don't know who was ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAre we gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes in yes\nYou'll remote feeling now that you were on telegraph road\nThat sounds that sounds about right\nNear misses viewing skill new Michigan album\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your back your my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach shielded\n... really steer you in the direction where you are no I mean you get a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of a psychological shows usually ended up what is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and there were timers the Detroit\nA good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered to books\nWhen I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book called the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating\nAnd then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen astronaut regard and I didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about\n... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe ... university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that\nKind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is and he really really\nWell you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery what she'll remember I remember the Detroit lists and so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThey do they do they still college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really uh gobbled up minimum yeah throw Hampshire\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about near death experiences above the other side what what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture\nTakes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment that the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and pays\nA then that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing the ...

before you know so\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that's you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed we're descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you are like hoard along mhm she knew this was

and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses the common goal\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what one shift people's mind about that question and\nIs it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbove ... let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please the rule but employees with all this what would you first of all say consciousness\nWell I think\nAgain we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we are not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called in attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers us a point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe the consciousness Lou outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... the phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio\nIt doesn't mean you ... or the signal or the signal\nIt keeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual side of all of this I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with the the the Android that robot\nAnd

know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location hormone viewing paradigm they're all kinds of experiences that people have had that they report

know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is it's something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their life\n[noise] and you have Britain in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of
