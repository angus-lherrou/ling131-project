can also clear our own negative thoughts and you know everyone has negative thoughts\nThat are created on a daily basis subconsciously so the salt water pretty much just clears gives you a good clearing of the RS\nWhy those are ... more\n[noise] why does a curse work well good question a curse works [noise] ah because we allow it to work for a member of curse cannot work if we um [noise] it's our minds you know the power of\nI mean is that the person putting the ... does the the job or is it the recipient who somehow what should happen\n[noise] it's the recipient that's uh that's very good question yes the recipients always recipient that let that happen and\nYou know most nine times out of ten [noise] um it's because our our our was or not intact and I don't think I've met anyone with an in tact ara but it's both and it can also be comic\nIt can be comic curses can be ... doesn't mean that you have to accept it because if you have learned you know you you said God or during the gods where the U.S into masters\nOr the angels and if you make it very clear that you no longer want this to be part of your experience you know you can really do something like an crossing and I'm release it from European but it's both but it\nBoils down to the person who is the target it's usually are mines that are not as as strong as they can be but it is possible for each and every one of us\nTo to have a very very very very very powerful mines and when that happens persist can affect us we'll just bounce off\nLet's go to the Rockies Charlotte in Pennsylvania harsher on what go ahead\nHi Charlotte I ... thank you for taking my call my question is how does one he'll himself how one he'll do I want to know fail much English just recently heard veil that is that something you can do to yourself\nAbsolutely merging has always always good\nExplains ...\nOkay this is just um like he does you get the bundle of stage and you light the stage and I prefer just to stage when I'm naked so right out after a hot bath I should've said that before and I didn't\nUm you just said in between your legs and you'll see age all around your body mostly around your head and especially behind your head because that's where entities like two to hang out [noise]\nUm so every crevice in your body just going to stage um and it works if you do it forty days in a row if you said your house and you said yourself you definitely will fill a difference\nOh I Hope that works Charlotte Allen in Fresno, California is with us now while I'm going to\nGo and bus um I have a question of how do you do get rid of stairs in your oh\nHow do you get rid of spirits great question you're going to have to email me for that because it's going to be more lengthy [noise] um I can give you um information on how to do a house exercises um now what kind of spirit I mean are they pulling your covers [laughter] you know when you wake up in the morning what ... how how serious are these\nWhat's happening either it's like it's like I'm I wake up in the middle of the night and you're like ... have you been talking and then when I go like into the causes no one's\nOkay so you probably have ... what is known as a a called an earth bound spirit so it can be someone\nSounds like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nSo it's probably not like a demon it's probably just that maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really passed\nOn to use a possible so that you cannot get rid of the shirt and spirit that are just lingers wherever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked um there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nBound you know what I mean why why would you um [laughter] it was legal magician girl\nI Know I'm Sorry and clarify so an evil magician and it can actually send you an earth down spirit\nAnd what they do is they will go and I'm looking for spirits at the cemetery who have not crossed over and they will um make the calls to spirits who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone or they raped someone and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send a spirit to you\nAnd if that happens actually quite frequently\nThe under the control of most of her\nShaking [noise] the dark lord\nAh absolutely I definitely believe in the dark lord exists\nAs when you should somebody sends them that's who I think is sending them\nWell it depends because there's always the the evil magicians are definitely being manipulated\nAnd by the dark lord and you know other demon so in a in a in a sense yes absolutely\nAnd you've got to watch out you got a raw Charles ... website is her name ... dot com she'll answer\nAll your questions when you email or that way banks Chris appreciate your being on the program ... who's behind the secrets door\nSports fans

a fun show we're going to honor okay Thanks Tom okay so let's open up the first secret door\nGosh I tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd I\nOh boy this is gonna be tough I'm fine how are you\nWell not in my ... days up oh I Know I got older things get tough for\nIts tend to read more hits Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed the\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to Olympic demand on\nEr and yes you are and we need we need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and these of January November and December I Can't believe it two months of outgoing anywhere\nNature [laughter]\nWell I tell you outlined we'd love to just stand and I got to tell everybody\nWho might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder out I went ... interviewed stamps and Friedman had a great interview and I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stamp was a rush a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near a big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming where there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the fields have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell I'm a latest word gap looks like they're about one point six climates for star that break out of the star and our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion store\nAll that main one sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know and that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well role of life and that changed our priests\nUpfront of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a ... farmers comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and that I Can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we realize I Would look we're fusion for example or you can get ... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop Russia and thought that the world was created and four thousand B. C.\nThat's right and who may beings around you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be [laughter]\nYeah just a little little is\nA A R ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know hurtful thing [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize it's a busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization I mean people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that the mirror throws a month that they put in incarcerated\nPeople you know like yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's really stand the you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for star select gift like huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand planets in our life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact them land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr were still slapped [laughter] and\nAnd so uh what most of us learned that if it's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of ... and the stars and things like that and uh hey\nWe're not number all or no [laughter] no and so we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind eye it's about a trillion dollars this year so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that at all the people don't get\nThe goodies of our from their work uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a but it appears to be close to what it is and I'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that ah\nIt's awful lot of energy you will to men universe and you might have gone to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... person and all almost kind of stuff and [noise]\nGee the universe crowded [laughter] you know it takes a while to get here and there you don't get on your bicycle and go to the next

you're still investigating big foot and everything else\nWell I'm doing great and I'm Still on stop\nComing to the fences an extra says it was for people and I've just written this new book that does include big foot\n... some ... I'm like that's the only a ... a retired police officer\nIn white all New York that back in Nineteen Seventy six had a ... year face to face encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic bipedal creature\nSaid he was thirty feet away from it and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual NYU hall in New York very soon as names off the ... one\nAnd so it's got to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy\nYou know you for already endorsing the book yes uh it it's something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences that and I'm covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nAre absolutely and and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have Arthur\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from like super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer ...\nAnd went and actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and then I've had dialogue with officer guzzling since then\nHe's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers are over it two nights band that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police\nAnd so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present and then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe that big foot bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the UFOs or I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet what's your take\nWell I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell ya story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think [noise]\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like of course you know if you're reading a knock which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book would be knock it talks about\nThe ... the thought of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called enough one those natural um had unnatural sex acts with the beast those field now if this is true\nThen perhaps these big foot soft watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these ... ah\nYou know made it with\n... and I find that they can be\nTo now think about this and a lot of these cases there seems to\nOnly be one foot friends there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy trail of of these types of friends\nAnd I've thought about that and I thought okay if if it's not a hoax then perhaps this\nCreature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eyewitnesses that only find one\nTrack that's a good point\nWhat do you think in the old Patterson give them all and so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] I don't know it ...

as I say again home the yes side of the nation\nThat was for people in the car but John Connelly was never in that bar there was never six people in there [noise]\nThat's strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other in the past and there was another in the past it was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife big in that car as well because supposedly governor Connelly with its head off with one of those bullets\nKnow you read the governor calmly was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets magic\nBut where was a were was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with the front of Kennedy and his wife was to his\n... but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third narrow\nDirt cheap there and I can't remember if the if the seat was um [noise] with Connelly and his wife\n... well you well you know ... ... you know I think con Connelly if I remember the artistic sketches of the shooting where they track the bullet Connelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got hit but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in\nA bench in front of the president or the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAnd so the so governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been another\nSeating there and then they drive early or any other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you were at six people and\nThat would have been six that strange route and Tom is looking at it and what he did which to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second to any ... to put your speaker downtime in a you tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up disapproved her film and I'm watching them come over and what are you just described Kennedy back with his wife right and I'm hoping you can hear me because I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a congressman front there I don't see a third row of seats\nI didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either belt thanks stop okay\nYeah that's amazing and and again\nI'm that's what I always thought that it was just Secret Service agents at the front seat and then second row with Governor crime and his wife and his wife was to his law president and Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nIt straight I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was in the front driving because everybody accused him of out turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this and I studied that as well because William Cooper is on was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had Ruben left and that if that's the case and also [noise]\nJeeze driving so they'd have to take his eyes off the term and then make perfect shot you know
