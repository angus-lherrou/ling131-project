happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high\nOkay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have I called because I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not up on that so all of those politicians that have look and see I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman or I Want to see two things first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Iran and possibly when\nUm the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side track 'em a booming economy or try to and bring down next man\nBut more importantly that man has kids especially a little one still at home and that little one but a young white include and his wife\nAnd we had a president and it's something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember from\nIts reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself businessmen and women don't have time for non Stein\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have an eating to have a meeting that have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy opponents the dots and win wars yep home if he doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he's a no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had\nThe audacity to get back up and get on the horse\nI thought I I have incredible\nAdmiration for people that are fighters in it and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what time it's hard and other people know that ... ... it it does that matter about this policy she knows who she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nTurned let's give you this comment today not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things would get anyone to jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilets um [noise] the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country runners business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country\nIt is a republic with a constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on this and you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I ... I I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow one thing but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas um a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them about what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I I think what he has done his dignify\nAt the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nIn ten years from now we can sell it on ... for ten times

old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks and I really don't have\nEnough truck driver you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers\nOut or you're not going to do it might not you know we I have many you know what I mean he has a little tiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper ... which is a high rise and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's what the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it's it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck is parked there in the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that are\nAre are is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million\nUh um men are males or without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of\nEither gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well\nI'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America\nOr we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need your oil we got water\nYeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it\nI don't know I Am one of those always missiles no guinea\nYeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nIn ... in fact I say I said what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south the you know that the ...\nOh is not having children there for her that I don't like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist group that obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me yeah that could happen\nBut what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population\nYou can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina have Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher I guess I'm Hi my question is that a trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and west coasts like Florida is now the third most populous state outbreak in New York state and also in Phoenix has become the largest city out raking or Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Herbert Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts to hit we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California\nNevada Arizona and New Mexico or the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate bite in Florida now and just sit on it yeah it's\n... ... the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said what is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be going to ask what is it one more big into\nYou know ... and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\n... ... ... does is going to be huge\n... it's going to be off the charts with the same thing is happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nFor a Vegas is that a good market [noise] huge\nOff the charts huge can't believe it it it for one or if it's cheap there are plenty of jobs or or I go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas is is unbelievable\nAnd ... All right Ken thanks keep in touch with us so you're always a walk him on the program kidding\nYou I I Love to take care man\nOkay be well his website linked up at coast to coast am dot com very easy

thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love the show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it ... the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family members but to the students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or little hesitant to come out and talk about the paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as there's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nUh or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter]\nYou know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the seal of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ... who's the chief scientist\nAt ions good guy he\nUh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's need all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there is still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and don't you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift\nGoing on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly are you supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet are there other podcast she was out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once more people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people or express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWell with Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner ah because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things\nUh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this was the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there and the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and ... and ... in the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which to do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very I I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island and we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time and\nI was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just ... my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little map and was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling in between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an end jelly presents\nIt it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear and\nUh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first ... experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what opened the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this

in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh friends are just like a continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the ah the base\nUh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so so that was my um my\nPre cognitive or or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event\nAnd later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had nobody wants to we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what\nIt was Bruce but uh she she she had the vision she was ah in in a city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was a you know\nSome people had it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a verified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this is\nThe ... that people had since that and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think a dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but you know he does talk about that\nWhat do you think ... the\n[noise] I I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was a younger a ...\nA camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the uh uh Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card she'd look at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was and a\nWet well above chance we would get the the suit right\nWe would get the sometimes the number or the or the the you know whether it was a\nKing or jak face card a\nVery often we get we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it no more yeah\nHe did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and I she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from its ... it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but\nI think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this it was a ... near Oric which is northern California and the red woods highway there and are driving south and uh my girlfriend was\nWas asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ...\nAnd as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit all of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very\nDark but it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and\nA ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I saw you I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Patterson gambling yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with all of this ...\nThere's been yeah there's been more sightings there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about

paranormal stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket um\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a um [noise] in our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know that that all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was\nHome to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay\nAnd uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and that but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just this check everybody out and\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh well do you have to fight for it I didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but in his offered it at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they say well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get\nMaybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could of accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical ... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the or seven weeks in the course into the course um\nUh it it it's been a wonderful experience it really what it what it turns out to be is\nYou know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories and that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories\nAnd it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience
