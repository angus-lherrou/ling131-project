S. are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitric oxide sulfur dioxide our water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe or the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the\nNations that are not able to put energy use effectively um can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations to become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nHim a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect\nBut over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles and the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there are causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now ... zone or free email newsletter get

saying and by the way this was a this was the primary I mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very\nPoor a scientific or procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Aaron truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nUrge is there to my child guy how's everybody doing the you're\nJust scared the heck out of my guests\nIraq as to hey buddy or many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy Whitley Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their young to call during the\nDay after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming\nWould would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the ah a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water or the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks in that it flows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and\nIt would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though\n[noise] [noise] yeah okay this external thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll eggs and they'll make it and\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John\nYeah but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to say you were\nWere talking about wind fails when I when I was living in Oregon\nOkay\nAnd I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was plenty for blue\nFlame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas well we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know Christianity now\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much I Can't have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some places matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas\nOr they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things\nThat's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nGeorge and thank you for having Steve von Loor stuff into spoken to him several times I heard\nHim on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that\nAccuracy or\nIs one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she not to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are\nAre are using a bag lady I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion ... it's quite a few of those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nWell I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we wouldn't have\nJust been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four dollars a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty\nWell rich may end or a robbery or a young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they're more willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's the process is told us is that isn't just sat in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily a dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive really\nImprove their lives they're doing All right it was out is just lost the war which a lot of them are\nAre counting illegally into this country because they had been tricked\nAnd deceived into thinking they're going to get a better quality of life and they had down there because you're having a lot more money in their pockets but that is true yeah I didn't I

been going for the last couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a if you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about um uh there are some some um\nIndications that the

Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gum and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky if they know out there's a lot of sand\nWhat harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching\nManufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago where see an animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThat this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure is on and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex would have our with our weather\n... ones don't hear about it in the new\nLet's can Steve's reaction to the Bruce like you\nBruce uh some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some cloud seeding attempt spoke to the\nRest of it it's not something I've run across a and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nOh well let's go man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe that the way to add on is being gay or engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on a show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the blotting out son well people are so much more hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said that are going to back off Kim trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to earth science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to the street and on the stock market on the weather if they want or against that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the story on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything\nNow I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't may never come up with a man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nWith Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant they want they were doing a strip of oil industrial nations away\nDescribing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China sit there with their sky completely on pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America but it got quite old guy now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that shame\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments Steve thank you good luck with the work outside the green box smokes that's the name of it up next let's

six detail vi\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast here with William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a\nBreak on us yes yes oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was pulled urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high treason could see it and\nWhen to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and won't position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with the kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses\nAre a United sooner aren't and rural areas right\nHe uh yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting\nA story a\nInvolving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined\nNinety percent of it is uninhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have\nLot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state and so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nUh the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out\nOver time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening tool the white to sing the husband was to shovel wisdom rate was so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools and they started a left\nHand spades on what she called the the wife pulled the stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plant\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn [noise] they had actually called the police report depth on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber and understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou're going to Rob the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods\nThey found one of the shovels leaning on the tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of the one hand garden trial with a rubber handle on it\nShowed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up so they went back to doubt they got a I guess an iPhone or something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush just thing it was buried in a tree several inches thick couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the tri ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was the cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives\nWell they said the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside and the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or made those were taking the head of lettuce want mashed\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nI stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just kept right over the warrior winning had it's full of feed and then left\nThey recall the uh the police over to see what had happened that would have transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big tall creatures coming in their property of walking here now so it\nJust seemed convincing\nYeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it and not being talked about which\nIs a very odd thing you know you know George think back to us for\nAlleged talk about that when we come back while you're at the top of the hour\nTalking about UFOs encounters big foot and we'll take phone calls stories and

background check into Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh could be wrapped up by the close of business today potentially leading to a confirmation votes over the weekend\nYou know them warm during the boom years the news on line\nBy the southeast Texas almost goes to goes\n\nOK well come back we'll you with us William the abominable snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of the things botanical\nAnd they form this unlikely friendship\nAnd turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ... and the professor said that it sounded like\nA Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with now this is a Russian speaking\nImmigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with so when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea and did these things\nOr or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman a speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they parked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as the ah the ah yesterday and the abominable below snowman I have no idea uh\nI have a ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier none\nOf this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the\nGlobe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the uh\nUh a durable ridges on the footprints taking everything's a hoax to them so you know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there thinking about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh uh we all tune\nIn because we're hearing things that we can get another ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the ...\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one night I'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around in the\nDark a now during the\nDay they had climbed up the sides of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night for the ICC\nWell when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was it you will fall on Tuesday is which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realize that this thing started ... daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer\nGot the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest and now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it\nFinally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it they could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming eating the trees around it\nSo that that passing a it was that bright\nYeah I mean it it it's a glowing orb of light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he described a globe blood coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow a bubble through want\nAs a child okay\nThis thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times for thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in this secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking at\nAt some point the glob separates from the org and now you have like this\nPower of blue and white light was this big foot in it and the orbit sitting separately it was then that they said\nFox News radio I'm currently not because I started getting the point where I was concerned 'cause I knew she wasn't going to get much rather see if I
