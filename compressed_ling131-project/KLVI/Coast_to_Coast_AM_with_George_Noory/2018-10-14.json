some times especially in qualifying where down the back stretch that raising the track bar getting ready for the next turn and then they're lowering it on the front stretch to get ready for the next turn a NASCAR\nSays drivers had approached the series with the desire to lose the adjustable track bar that means they have to go back to adjusted to track part during pit stops and of course since like last year that during pit stops they've taken one more guy off the road so that adds to the challenge of pit stops\nRoss Jeff stain or does have a fulltime ride next year and a cup series not a

that\nYeah not only not only do I believe it not only do I alleged but anyone who reads the book is almost compelled to go along with those conclusions because if there's one thing about me are uh uh\nThat I never do I never make a charge without support in it and uh I I have a tremendous amount of support for everything and I say I don't just say something without giving four or five examples to support what I'm saying\nWhen I talk about the incompetence of the prosecution in this case it's page after page after page there's just no way that anyone can read this book or without coming to the same conclusion and it's because\nOf these revelations the shocking revelations of incompetence in in my book outrage that the word of mouth has been such that the book has shot up the number one of the country because\nHere too for the American people have been blaming the jury for this verdict and of course the jury was very bad uh don't get me wrong and I are on that at all very very bad\nThe many of them blaming the LAPD claiming the LAPD botched the case before I came to trial and but the main reason why this case was loss was the unbelievable and confidence of the prosecution in this case and you have to realize are and I think you know my background I'm very\nPro prosecution no one in this country was more supportive of these prosecutors in Iowa throughout the entire case I mean I even sent them a telegram\nOn the morning or there's some Asian trying to pump them up but I had a um an option here either not do the book and I actually I was talked into doing it by my editor and I'm happy now that he did a or write the book and be candid and uh\nThis is a very serious charge that I make and against the prosecution in this case I supported in space so there's just no question about it\n... on either incompetent was up there and watched every moment of the trial a lost a lot of sleep over and I presume you pretty much do as much as you could the same thing yeah did you sit there and sort of beating your fist against the wall about how well\nYou know I also got on radio and TV I kept it to a minimum but I got on radio and TV and said many of the things that I'm saying in the book now so this was a Monday morning quarterback but I get on radio and television and say they've got to offer some of the evidence is very very incriminating evidence the it was a conventional type of evidence that\nLaypeople you don't even have a very bright lay people have been consistently basing\nVerdicts have guilty odd for the past two centuries the type of evidence that\nIs automatically associated even by people rather low intelligence or with guilt DNA is very good evidence don't get me wrong and I'm not criticizing the prosecution for presenting\nA DNA evidence in this case a but DNA is very complex very difficult to understand it and it was all an alien to this jury but evidence like Simpson or taking off when he was being charged with these murders and they're finding in his possession\nOf gun a passport a cheap disguise several fresh changes of honor clothing and and and ... a driver the eight thousand seven hundred fifty dollars in cash on him when she proceeds to tell the police the Simpson had given him inside the bronco that type is automatically associated by lay people off a with guilt and it was not offer it to this jury found that Evan\nAnd none of the low speed stuff uh Dominic Dunn the respected writer has publicly stated wanted to prosecute him didn't present that evidence he says through his sources\nThat he's aware of shaped conversations of Simpson during the bronco chase where he's talking on a cellular phone sobbing crying claiming to be an innocent man who framed is that why they don't use it\nIn the frame no no no not no no uh Dominic is partly true there he was denying guilt a big deal\nBig deal up [laughter] it means nothing when someone is charged with murder and they'd be an ideal of course they're going to do I get off who in the world expects them to confess\nThat is the reason by the way that the prosecution did not offer that evidence nor did they offer a suicide note with absolutely reek with guilt I mean showing an innocent person charged with murder who would write a note like that so they were afraid of it\nWell that yeah but but but for the wrong reasons in the suicide note\nSimpson denies guilt to\nAlso the thirty two minute interrogation of Simpson the day after the murders right ah incidentally I have the I was able to get a hold of the audio that thirty come in and interrogation and I've transcribe it and it's an independent of the book and the only book on the Simpson case that has interrogation ...\nWhere he admits dripping with blood on the night of these murders has no idea how he got caught but in that interrogation he also denies guilt and the prosecutors you're right they kept that out they kept that out all of that because they didn't ... this is what they said you can't make this up it's too far out to make up dark and says it in his book\nThey didn't want the jury to hear Simpson denying guilt without us taking the witness stand ... but aren't the jury already knew that Simpson had denied guilt I mean they knew he pled not guilty that's why they were having a trial for Pete's sake I mean\nIf the guy had come fast if he had pled guilty there would not have been a trial you're going to keep out extremely powerful evidence like this or just to prevent the jury from hearing something that they already know that it's mind boggling and this is the mentality of these prosecutors good people the good guys lost here\nThis is the mentality of these people were representing the state of the Simpson case and and people wonder why this guys on the golf course with a smile on his face\nYou're going to keep out for instance the passport the cheap disguise several fresh changes of honor clothing and the fact that our colleagues has all this money on him which Simpson gave him all this cat because he denying guilt because he's denying ... I mean the jury doesn't know that he was denying get why are they having a trial it's mind boggling\nI don't know what about the civil trial and all of this that didn't come out in that trial will come out we were not in the civil trial I can\nGive you a virtual one hundred percent guarantee that um the plaintiffs lawyers like Daniel Patrick ... whom I spoke to they will be offering that evidence anyone would offer that evidence why these prosecutors didn't\nWhy they're so incompetent I don't know because I keep hearing that around the country why are they someone competent why did they do this and I can't tell them I mean it's like asking me a wire Michael Jordan and Larry Bird dog a great basketball players I Can't tell you I can tell you that they are but uh the genesis of why they're so great I I don't know but yeah that\nEvidence will be offered like virtually any other prosecutor in the country would have done if they had handled the case that evidence will be offered during the civil trial and I'm very confident that there'll be a judgment against Simpson uh uh in that civil trial the question is whether he's already spirited as money out of the country and they're gonna be able to like on the judgment that none of the real problem\nDuring and Clark both how to marry in your face kind of a presentation and a lot of people translated that to competence and they apparently didn't look a little bit deeper at some of the things we just talked about uh-huh oh with regard to the evidence not presented\nWell actually they were not in the face they should have been a lot more in the face they were much or too casual a and laid back they were extremely casual and laid back they may have been a little in the face a outside the presence of the jury when they were talking to judge Ito in front of a jury\nThey couldn't possibly have have been more deaths than imagine in your eyes what this guy Simpson did to these two victims viciously stabbing him to death you know their life blood draining out of them the horror and the fright in their eyes the last moments when they were trying to survive the magic\nAnd that now imagine now imagine Marsha Clark during jury selection telling this jury\nWell this started in your mind that I just told you he is such a sympathetic guy okay then telling the jury this is not a fun place for me to be on time making this up this stuff in the transcript if she tells the jury this is not a fun place for me to be art\nThat's like telling the jury you know I really don't want to be prosecuting this guy but I've been assigned the case so what can I Do then she tells the jury or you may not like me for bringing in this case I'm not winning any popularity contest for doing so art psychologically nothing could be worse than to tell the jury\nIt's called outrage is number one\nOn the New York times best seller list you're\nOut and get it I Know you want this is a good book believe me there I was\nGoing through our grill somewhere in time tonight retreat coast to coast am\nFrom July twenty bird Nineteen nineties [noise]\n[noise] with market basket new loyalty rewards guard get big discounts reward points and digital coupons for extra savings this week save on M.

Nineteen Ninety six [noise]\nNow back to Vincent de ... uh\nUh Vincent welcome back products want to clarify what black shirt saying something about cutting himself in the fall and the media was saying that and they they made that assumption ah he did say something and the third week of an interrogation about going to the bronco to pick\nThe cellular phone he did not say he cut himself on a cellular phone they asked him specifically how did you cut yourself his exact words the whole thirty two imminent interrogations in the book you said I don't know later in the interview they asked him again how did you cut yourself is exact words were I have no idea man so he's not say he got himself and his other\nCurrent boxing did the prosecutors signed the tactics that you saw them more because they were dealing with the jury system that's made up primarily of sympathizers OJ and people who are not quote average citizens in ... in other words people who can take 'em you know several months off work to attend a trial\nWell I don't really know what that means because uh if these people weren't the brightest people in the world with which you question may imply that all the more reason why you offer conventional evidence like flight you know after he was being charged with these murders he took off\nThe fact that he taught himself and has no idea how I got got cuts the fact that he writes a suicide note I mean\nYou know when you're charged with murder or if you're innocent you're going to be blazing mad that you're being charged a desperately want to prove your innocence find out who murder the mother of two children and that he becomes very passive and he writes this farewell letter that reads exactly like a suicide note\nHe refers to himself as the last person these things are incompatible with innocent so in answer to your question\nThat's all the more reason why they should have offered these conventional uh items of evidence I'm not saying they should offer DNA but not to the exclusion of these conventional\nLet's talk about DNA for second all these other issues inside right I'm just an average person does um but I understand numbers why didn't the DNA evidence alone convicted\nOkay now that again we get into absolute extreme uh uh uh incompetence here um the defense every time every time they made an argument to explain away incriminating evidence the prosecution either did not respond\nAt all which is virtually unprecedented or they responded in a very anemic fashion\nThe main pieces of evidence in this case other than that that tape but I just told you you give me a hundred dollars and yellow pat I would've convicted him on that thirty two minute interrogation alone but the main item of evidence against Simpson was his blood was that the murder saying okay there was blood on the ... gate\nOr which was also has found later though yeah no no no no it was collected later not found later no it was it was it was seen that night by five detectors all of whom will testify whether or not collected the night\nFind if you move from an out of the case altogether is there a conviction\nOff [noise]\nIf ferment were not involved at all in this case um they would have had them the defense would have had a more difficult time\nArguing the conspiracy theory and injecting race into the case but they would have found some way to do it uh although it would have been more anemic the prosecution would have had a greater likelihood of a conviction or without from it\nIs there any one thing you can go but if you were to just pull it from the case would would have made it a slide the conviction\nSlide you sales law ... law no\nNo no because of this jury um the printed it let me say this\nThe prosecution when they presented scientific DNA evidence that Simpsons blood was founded the murder scene they did they did in fact prove Simpsons guilt beyond a reasonable doubt beyond all doubt\nBut we're we're dealing here with a jury that was not operating with too much intellectual firepower number one number too many of them particularly the black years were probably biased and Simpsons favor however here's the key point\nPowerfully presented chasing summation which we didn't have here at all light years away from that where you put a ... on the jury and use spoons feed them can handle both of those problems but this was a problem jury no question about it and with a problem jury it's going to be difficult to get a conviction but you can do it you can do it\nWe're talking here about an F minus presentation and yet the first vote that this jury talk back in that jury room people tend to forget this a black journey white you're voted guilty on the first ballot doesn't emerging dollar an hour after the after the jury room if you can get a temp too\nWith an F. minus presentation you can imagine bikes for Appalachian what would've happened uh if you had an a plus performance which the people the state of California are entitled to I think almost assuredly\nEven as the ... ah pardon even a C yeah you'd have had a guilty verdict or at a minimum a hung jury that\nYou'd have had problems with this jury unless you had an a plus performance the only type a jury the only type a jury that you can't turn around art is the type of jury who state of mind is\nThough we know OJ's guilty or we don't care uh we like O. J. blacks have been discriminated against by white throughout the years we're going to give OJ to free murders but let me tell you it would be extremely difficult\nTo find even one juror without outrageous state of mind much less all twelve\nAnd and looking at the backgrounds of these jurors for instance The Simpsons for person was in the Nineteen Ninety LA county employee of the year\nI'm listening to what they said on radio and TV reading a book written by three of them I get no sense that even one of them had that state of mind and I don't believe that for one single moment\nSo this was not the best jury but they would have responded to an a plus perform as what happened here is that the prosecution allow this jury to live with their conscience they did not eliminate for this jury all possibilities of symptom being found not guilty\nOr not the whole of the Rodney King business in the ... and all the rest of the banging over this which was right or how much difference with that ...\nWell no question about it that affected the verdict but again again invariably we come back to the unbelievable incompetence of these prosecuting here's would Cochrane debt and it was duplicitous on his part it went right over the head of ... who's a black went right over his head\n... Cochran argued to this jury a police frame up from their experience of police brutality\nPolice brutality and and frame of our two completely different types of misconduct Darden never distinguish these two types and the jury's mind\nUh what the black community has been experiencing throughout the years from a small segment of the LAPD and other major forces around the country maybe two or three or four percent that stay in the blue uniform of the other officers what they'd been experiencing is excessive force police brutality and then of course the please lie to cover it up okay that's what they've been experiencing\nFrame ups frame up by the police for burglaries robberies rapes murders\nVirtually virtually unheard of it's not done it's not common I Know this I've talked to enough black\nI've talked to people who work in the black community that's almost unheard of and\nYet ... did not see this issue time magazine did not see the issue time said well obviously it was easy for this jury to buy the frame of argument\nAll the jury had to replay on their mind is the tape of Rodney King get be getting beaten by the LAPD has if Rodney King getting getting beaten by the LAPD\nIs the same thing is the LAPD in other words is if the LAPD beating Rodney King is essentially the same as they're framing OJ Simpson who totally completely different types of police misconduct and it's my belief with us\nKnowing that this jury back on the jury one was thinking this is the LAPD we know we can't trust them you know there's a reasonable doubt that they may have framed OJ instead of thinking to themselves wait a while yeah maybe we can't trust the LAPD for certain things that frame up\nThat's absurd I was on a San Diego radio last week and a fifty five year old black fifty five year old black woman called and she was carrying intimate you know about the the the LAPD in the San Diego police department here in history blacks and I said no ma'am\nAnd she believed there was a frame up and all that I said man I'm going to ask you a question now and I want you to think about it I don't want you to answer right away I think about it before you answer your fifty five years of age I Want you to get back into your path as it ever happened to you or any member of your family any relative any close friends\nHave they ever been framed in other words are completely innocent please come along if they ever been framed for a burglary or a robbery or raped the arson or murder I'm not exaggerating art she paused for five ten seconds and these very words no\nShe hadn't thought about it you file sure and and garden should have pointed this out to the jury it would have been in a boom in eighty moment for all of them he didn't do it it went right over his head\nDuring look we're near the top they are but I Want to ask you very quickly once the trial got underway was their juror targeting\nThat I Can't tell you I mean I I read I don't know that is that how do we say you're you're\nTired aren't getting I mean targeting by both sides were they both are or were they both playing games and ... off they didn't think were a favorable to\nTheir that oh yeah of course that it's not an every trial it's called ... or a primary challenge where you don't have to give any reason whatsoever if you don't like the way someone looks at you the color of their time\nNo no I'm I'm Talking about once the trial was underway\nTrials underway yeah there was a little bit of that\nUh but it wasn't too successful because he was not a discharging people jurors unless he came up with some evidence of possible impropriety you know one of them was\nWhat am I going the or the ... the the anonymous letter\nYeah right but I mean he was under the impression that perhaps this woman uh what's going to write a book I Wonder if he was or not I don't know but there was some evidence that went in that direction and yes the defense want it to get rid of her of course 'cause she was perceived to be pro prosecutors ... you know didn't just willy nilly a discharge are\nAll right where we're at the top of the hour give me thirty more minutes 'cause I've got a couple more questions okay All right good Vincent gee a bully OC is my guest he will be back in a moment his book outrage number one on the New York times\nBest seller list right by the premier network\nWas art bell

Vinson thank you for staying I Know you've got an early interview a nonstop interviews I guess [laughter] um this again relates to the Simpson trial it's an important question was there anything\nIn ... track record or background that should have set off warning bells to kill our city before selecting them to do the prosecution\nWell I had never heard of either one of them before but that that really doesn't mean anything 'cause we have a thousand prosecutors at the days off here in LA and there's one central office in about Eighteen outline offices or I have since learned that the Clark was perceived to be among the top\nProsecutor stopped da's office ... no one that I Know that said that Chris darn what's perceived to be a top rocket why he was brought on the run on the case I don't know he did handle\nThe AC calling calling a situation in front of the grand jury when the d._a. was contemplating the indictment against collie so he had a little background there 'cause that was an ancillary up part of this case whether colleagues with the indicted for being an accessory after the fact murder sure and then there was also the argument that whether he was a token black\nBut uh I can tell you a little bit about his background 'cause I've checked into it at least the seven years prior to the trial [noise]\nUh he told the jury I'm Talking about Darden I've been profit getting bad cops for seven years well I happen to know that the data ... bad cops here in LA it's extremely rare and the Rodney King situation was no exception I can just about guarantee you are that\nIf it hadn't been a tape there by that George holidays eighty one second tape in private citizen no one would have ever heard the name uh Rodney King\nA fact Rodney king's brother went to one of the division of the LAPD the day after the uh the beating\nAnd this was before the LAPD knew about the tape and he um he wanted to file a complaint against the officers and the death stars and said look here\nOthers and a lot of trouble there wasn't gonna be any filing again for officers\nIn any event when guards and said I've been prosecuting bad costs for seven years I started thinking whoa wait a wise is this in the middle of the night or with the goblins out I mean how can I haven't heard about this so I called down the office and\nSpoke to two fellow deputy da's down there who worked alongside Darden and the special investigations division of the da's office which is responsible for prosecuting police misconduct cases here's what they told me\nThat in the seven years leading up to this trial Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen Ninety four garden tried one case in one case only it was a misdemeanor case wasn't even a felony case a and he lost it it's a thirty ninth and don't and street case thirty ninth adult and there was a duplex there\nThere was believed to be a crack house and the police went in there and trashed it looking for crack and they were prosecuted for vandalism and dark and handle it and lost that case and if you look at his book you mentioned a lot of cases in his id\nAh but the only case that he mentions taken the trial if if you read very close to me is the thirty nine and don't treat gay so he didn't really have a sufficient background\nBut it's so then what do you think because of color\nWhile I don't know I don't really don't know why I was brought it not not before those seven years I don't know what his background is he says that he had prosecuted quite a few homicide cases and uh\nUh he may be telling the truth I don't know about that and he may have been successful but I can tell you that when he told the jury I been prosecuting bad cops for seven years he was not telling the truth was investigating bad cops for seven years but not prosecuting them\nBut as long as public image was lousy or as I watched the trial I fully expect to garden at any moment to go jumping across the room and slug somebody\n[laughter] and and that is what it look yeah he he did have a chip punish false hope so [laughter]\nThat that that's pretty colorful Louis articulated there aren't\nLet me give you one one just unbelievable example of of of incompetence of between the two prosecutors surveys and it just it just illustrates a ... and again the book is three hundred and fifty six pages of this of this type of thing you're aware of the ... of the matter ah bringing the vial of blood back to Iraq and have you're aware of that whole that whole issue\nOh yeah okay um let me just briefly tell you why why he did it normally you collect\nBlood from a suspect in a homicide cases a couple of days later a week later a monthly or sometimes even a couple of years later 'cause there's no statute of limitations for the crime and murdered\nAnd I'm a ... so it's it's it's not within hours after the murders as was the case here\nNow the the the the defense argued that he should have booked that vial of blood immediately ... and he could have done that however\nNormally you do not get a D our number which you need to book items of evidence until the the uh the evidence at the crime scene has been collected by the criminalist pursuant to the search warrant\nHere that hadn't been done yet\nA a fun was still at Rockingham first he has been a Bundy collecting evidence and evidence is booked sequence chilly up by numbers so at the book that vile\nIt would've been item number one but what the reason he didn't do that if he had no way of knowing what number of phone was given to the items of evidence that he was collecting Bundy and Rockingham it would have messed up the whole numbering system\nYou know what it would have made the argument that carried it around an opportunity a impossible yeah right\nAh but yes but it's also it was in advisable but I mean how could he ever dream that people like Shaq and Cochran are out there accusing him of framing someone for murder I mean here's a guy twenty eight years on the force\nNot one citizen complaint against them and twenty eight years he's about to retire and a few months with his wife Rita to his farm in Indiana and he's going to frame OJ Simpson it's mind boggling\nYou free you plant evidence and a capital case in California and testified falsely you can get the death penalty yourself under one twenty eight of the California penal code the prosecutors never even made that argument in in in any event Fong\nHad already given item number one to the spot of blood above the door handle and uh so so I'm a fan\nOut or brings the vile blood back the fog and any detective will tell you that when they turn over items of evidence to the to the criminalist in their mind that's the equivalent of booking not I just I'm giving you the background as to why he brought it back here why he brought it back to Rockingham survived torture him on the day after the murders but but here's the point that I Want to get into\nThe defense argument of police frame up and conspiracy and all that at the heart of that very argument was banned that are bringing the vile blood back in what they claim does that then I met her in his evil co conspirators to blood out of that violin planted it had Rockingham and Bundy was a major major major issue with the trial\nPost trial post trial\nSeveral the juror said that it was the most suspicious thing that the LAPD did during the\nTire case okay now there are several arguments that the prosecution could have made to knock down this core defense argument about men that are bringing the vile blood back the Rockingham I mentioned several in the book I'll just give you two very brief ones right here\nIf he was going to bring a vial of blood back the rock and obviously he put it in a suit pocket you wouldn't put it in a large ... thereby advertising to every one that he was bringing something onto the premise is that just common sense your point number two number two\nVan out are already knew that hundreds upon hundreds of reporters and other members of the media had already congregated at Rockingham an Bundy their cameras blanketing the premise is picking up for the evening news all\nThe movements of everyone on the state there are helicopters up above filming everything down below obviously planting would have been absolutely impossible there are many many other arguments\nNow what if I told you what if I told you listen to this because it's unbelievable there's no other additive than in the eight hours of summation that these two prosecutors gave neither Clark ... said one single word to\nTry to knock down this court the fence argument about band that are bringing the vial of blood back to Rockingham they never once even touched on the issue I check the transcript three times I had my wife check is unbelievable I said there's got to be some attempt to knock this now because it goes to the heart of the defense case\nArt when you get to the point when you don't even open up your

Institute in Virginia and William cells as a suicide Hitler therapists and he guide you\nDo these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience they love to hear more from\nWilliam welcome to the show and thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance such a a a out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explored it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first holy conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer\nBut I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and\nIt's it's quite a life change your family you had\nYour entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise uh that I\nI learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nNow was this before or after you became a Hitler therapists\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hypnotic therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your ... e where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades ... but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days one by one day I was sleeping on my side and when I become aware I realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall and when I\nDid you reach the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the end of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that\nWas my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah\nWell it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself you need that said I think\nIs the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one and then\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's\nWhat's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and it's all in the tens information's human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional [laughter] and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms yeah\nAnd not all human and has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] did not want to do anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and union of their meal because ... he'll meal you and you explained the because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an inch and is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself there is no\nUm when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really tell us what to look like when you have people come and I called it

wake up in the middle of the night and the norm all over\nOr their vibrating or there are hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you ... when you are when people are going to these travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation both\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states\nHave consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery were twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about something to finding Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nA mind mirror is just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it for control it and get the most of it\nMy main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nThe literally connect with their higher self with are multi dimensional self right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nAnd found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's ... into a restaurant in southern or and there are ... resources on their uh\nUm [noise] I I

Bonnie travel\nAnd he's been doing twenty five years of research and then ... says made over ... pounds participants who have gone through the ... e training at ... ... and yeah\nAnd he's come up with a common let me put it in nominal associated with these things you can explain this to our audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years okay but I've been\nStudying this in practice in it for forty\nOr just to go on my website astro info dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having or so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm\nA floating or um vibrations high energy sensations eighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally\nTo the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset of Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through colors dial it if you're seen through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body because you're having it does it mean you've\nActually did your body but it'd be injured in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things that\nUh for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your\nBody right is\nI find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nThen that's the dance on it because that happened I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that's an out of money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ...\nThis is what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored everyone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take it for granted no one you\nKnow there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep\nAnd you can observe this actually during an out of body experience losing ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they are twitching and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream can or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural his\nBreathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... its temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't ... biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how the difference between now and imagination\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one of master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier and World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get to download and it's more than just the download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification or lunch\nOn on ... and I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's this is not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nThat's very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left of special your religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe that you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this\n... and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it menu sudden oh my God now I got it and it's it's a transformational powerful experience and very self empowering\nMm need in now back to the report that you had you talked about the

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative entered its you are going to create it\nIn your mind is going to hold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness in a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell he or creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering it\nIt incredibly thought response of environment\nAnd you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I remember but it could very well in and out of body\nWhere I was shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got up and motorcycle and took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that I'm\nBrian ... owns a motorcycle and it was and it looked me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was benign was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak be honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I Will cut because\nI keep a scare to each other yeah I'd I don't know of that and that as well out of body travel less likely\nMhm well it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there was no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective\nGroup of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create I Try called consensus\nMany types of realities that exist in in a multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look at them learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWere used a linear time writing to gravity\nWe're used to their you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you don't you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my work shops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence yes\nSo that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which has astro info dot org you'll find out about all of his books and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to attack about ghost since Colorado and some of the great history but the forgotten town that's Colorado Sylvie back I only see you're listening to cook because I Am [noise]\nSunday October fourteen what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nFor decorating the house or just studying the theory mood our pumpkins by the platelets has ... with labor inspired by that we've got to apologize\nEveryone's talking about like the famous people ...

I see it and I actually feel it\nI'm just really like humans examples\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is gonna sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today\nI was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nAnd managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love the story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts violate just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown\n[laughter] ... extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for it\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years\nAfter five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you well after you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd an artist you know and it's very iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like wow I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you didn't fool out\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named\nWe are one of those shows on news on farms which\n\nLong\nOn march ... beer punishment for ally Saudi Arabia missions found responsible for the deaf or Saudi journalist ...\nThere's a lot of sick and\nMade me especially so because this man was a reporter\nTo something you'll be surprised you're missing something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the two so we're going after she was going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment\nBrazil into pure on CBS sixty minutes on birds\nBuilding for impersonating President Trump actor our boy when headlining a political fundraiser in New Hampshire\nBaldwin in an interview this summer drew attention when he said if he ran in twenty twenty you ... we went with the funniest most exciting most crazy campaign\nFox's jarred help this dysfunctional\nBefore once in Illinois during the Nineteen thirties and wants to St Louis and this week in Nineteen Ninety eight the U.S house of representatives\nVotes to proceed towards impeaching President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice\nBy December Nineteen Ninety eight the Republican led house had gathered enough information from investigation committee to vote in favor of impeachment which in turn sent the case of the Senate Bill Clinton was the first president to be impeached by the house of representatives Andrew Johnson an Eighteen sixty eight Johnson was also acquitted ...\nWill be a broad ... dot com studios\nBurn them learn to\nThe\nVery\nLong\n\nCoast to coast they you know your guest Lisa gar\nWelcome back because because I Am I just want to give you a quick reminder that I also have a great show on the guy a network along with\nGeorge ... who's got beyond belief myself called inspirations on guy and you can check it out at information's ... dot com it's G.

hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you what we were talking about men are few springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just ... you\nKnow I'm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage it springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nI went up there to the theater\nAnd the ghost is gone it worked\nThat all of this worked out beautifully [laughter] needing now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before the book yes\nOh yes she knew it was hot it but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August\nTwo thousand sixteen because the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball ... this was reaching out that's certainly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes but you seem to be the you'd like the public is for these ghosts and the [laughter]\nHe liked to have made it is it's\nMeant to be what you have a wave really connecting history with these you do the research it's like a real live go go ...\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goals but like other little girl the bouncing ball isn't she cute I'm like no leave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited no\nNo not if they are they're just picking you you've tricks\nHere they are in prison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I absolutely believe are in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know there we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for growth if he wants to see them with your eye\nIs at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nIs a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows\nDoes that make sense yes that does it make straps when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast and it only I call it\nThe God like it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now haunted or did you might have been non Huck lead the gas the ghost follow you\nWrite that they do on like two words it's very funny it's the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter] but\nUm that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk on her name's bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know what these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this this town is very hunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah you have to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nHave you tried to say it's happening it won't so\nYeah they're like oh Archie especially you know how to do all kinds of magic tricks I'm like no really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there\nAre there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's the essence\nPart right in there oh yeah that you know this family hotel right there on that a native them it's very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI have heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managed to springs and bolder and even as to part\nWith S. with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up light up with the red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives he used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine as you're right there in the center of the country yeah the center of all of the\nPikes peak they believe was the naval of the universe I find that fascinating

T. V. A. T. that are have a I think that's what the native youth used to call it\nBut they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhine whine and we're not going to call that connect it to the mother okay yeah\nIt's connected to the mother and think about the native is the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well yeah\nAnd if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers the flight over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards without the town it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brush it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone\nExactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm theoretically white powder exactly up and down sideways hampering you know like a helicopter ... a fascinating and they didn't know what till they there was no explanation now so what I did\nWas I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not there weren't a lot of people out yet but a lot of people thought this I mean just outrageously crazy\nAnd he followed his story in Kansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing and the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's there is no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the world Wide Web could possibly know with farmers\nIn Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know that we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as a the director of the paranormal convention and one of my friends is named Dan ... and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot or come to the back door opened his door actually um [noise]\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter] and um then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal\nAnd he does live above green mountain fall's vaccination these rock formations and there's Patrick lessen the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot I mean why not\nBut have you seen in the writings\nHe believes that my friend he only if it's um they you know it's like stick figures I find that fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very the metric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believe that his property is a portal\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider\nThe possibility that\nMay be big foot is a missing link\nI times holding corps operate will be

Institute in Virginia and William cells as a suicide Hitler therapist and he guide you\nThrough these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that things just from my experience they love to hear more from William welcome to the show and thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such as this ten ... I ... out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explored it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer\nBut I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change or something you had to leave your car life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nNow was this before or after you became a hit in the ...\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hypnotic therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades ... but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects\nAnd you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping\nOn my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this\nBut you feel a vibration of floating sensation when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered\nThe wall and when I ... you reach the arm out oh no I was nonsensical\nI I didn't realize it was you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief\nBut it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea\nAbout the what I had first stepped into here and a ...\nOver the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nHits addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally a pain the answers for yourself ... ... that's sad I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend\nUpon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from another words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs one of them\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the tens information's in the in ... why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional [laughter] and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms yeah and not all human\nAnd it has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and union of their meal because usually they heal meal you aren't you blame them because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an inch and is a universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere is no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nWhat they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're constantly you teach and then really tell us what to look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nOh great invention him only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being\nThe center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe
