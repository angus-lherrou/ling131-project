artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad [laughter]\nUh well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that\nBecome better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred than two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about a I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking central the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nThat may do a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\nI I always transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you\nKnow if you had a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one ... air\nAirplane for people\nI think you've got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um\nYou have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems may be much much more brittle much one better they made breaking big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think\nUh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that for a very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can if if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business ten ten percent past ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now have the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances in a ah ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nIt's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary a A R if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said ah there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a peaks or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's\nThat's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also stiffed for gun powder and\nYou know it can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well\nBetter I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I like the other guys all have that but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people that have just\nSo automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave the shoot\n'em and it requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally a daily but that it because people were close to and so it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build a weapon systems it's good to have it\nWell for for three very easy reasons you could argue that the the better the more effective at their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you argue that you\nWill be saving lives of soldiers ...\nUh what in in whatever country you are and and\nA third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective while enabling Portugal eat alone were the political cost going to war which is there's not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nUh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the commercial will finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars do you see the day that the\nYou know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll

have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away\nIt's hard to see the better job that's created\nAnd what happens is everybody every time technology makes a great job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip it I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know you you still a drink\nYou know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your back there is something you didn't like about it\nYou have a question about where the Russians were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do or what a two year old can do let alone and an adult\nYeah so\nCorrect correct but it's proved very difficult\nLike right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an age and ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that I'm not like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell\nWith physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer\nCan\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines and which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model that and the computer just take a worm that lives in the computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we're we're so spectacularly\nAmazing ah beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we are able to do\nAnd and we used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough for the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig it knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man that was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal\nBecause agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize and we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave his prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened uh you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think\nThat um that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or you're ...\nYou're right that's the only official intelligent you it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how terrifying once that and yet we don't look back

still end up living in a world where there's a billion people who are are hungry or you've got a lot of people who need to feed you still have illness that\nThat kills everybody you start poverty which I think it's a technical problem you have all these problems technology can solve why do I say that because\nThey don't have to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred and bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in\nDisease how do you slow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and\nAnd finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream about whether it be great if and now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough of all the good stuff for everybody and we just we're almost there and and so I don't think we would speed it up if I could there's there's

sir\nThat morning and thanks for having me on the shows and say interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest or if you think that the way technologies progressing that when they get to that your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as working alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people only worked Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because she did go up to ... just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education they can grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human ... turns out so even in the future people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home\nBut not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours a week\nIf if if I productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we say that home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm\nI I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine a\nFixed by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we want it to until I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human

course we've done that since landmines we drop drop dumb bombs or I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines that they kill 'em so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to you\nKnow make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth\nA it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the

a genius that guy is\nAnd you know I Will tell you a gym is a good man to\nMan I I have some great stories about him where he is just allowed me and to um like the the theater where they record all the music and he said Julie stand here this is where the director stands and they you know it's the best place to here they get every beat and I'm like oh I Love this guy\nYou could agree background by the way\nI have an end or are you talking about my hillbilly roots in Oklahoma\nTalking about my day job you\nDo we haven't done the Oklahoma and who do we do [laughter]\nI Do I have a fabulous

their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers said about the fact that I mean here you are you were corporate executives doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ... we'll talk of [noise]\nYou know this it's it's a it's a great question I I think because what I Do day in day out is rooted in data and\nAnd I'm and I'm known you know within the organization that thing in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence 'cause they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd you wouldn't be stuff\nAnd you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just\nThey can't make their way over right to our mind that's right um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because so many people have had him\nAnd I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happening not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this ... like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is gone through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead because I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes for tiger feet a little bit about medium ship just you know some of the things a little bit about but I started um I started researching and\nThere is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go sit we're almost the majority\nAttorney were barely a minority and that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and\nEvery two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds\nSomeone in North America is doing the work is\nNot always saying yes every two seconds\nSo none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you who is listening um but they can also now use them statistics that tell their friends hey\nI had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now you have nothing to hide and have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because of a personal situation\nYes so did you did\nThis started for me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey and well a transformational Journey Through grief [noise] um I lost my mother to all timers\nAre and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost Porto because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh he goes well hold her guys what am I done\nAnd and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand\nPhotographs with us\nYou have been doing this show me things what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found I used\nIn what a great ad by the way right and apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise] um it\nWas I found I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron outta found but like a regular camera and it was interesting because all I captured on that\nAnd we're ... not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else interesting no\nWhen this was going on for the entire jury will will get into your mother's situation all old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you started to get the strange thing\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides I ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um\nI I started you know and then after I saw the first coast in a photograph I um\nYou know I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as in it's not true\nSkeptics that you want to know marching\nRight right I it it was a navy this can't possibly be true kind of person but you know I was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing\nChaos and when you're in chaos\nUm you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of eased because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it and I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a photo lab on like negative mode or add some color because you different things would come out I became\nShe said imagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today [noise] she's like yeah he was dead and so yes it completely changed me because I firmly believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nYou sure and the big lesson gift\nIs about paying attention people say what's your book about and I feel I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you the pay attention and trust yourself\nWhen you take your picture mhm are you aiming at something or does it just tapping\nIt's though I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it was an ad and all burned out yet [noise] and um what I learned was\nThat smoke is like a canvas forgot\nI was able to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pulled a smoke around them I could see their shape or form\nAnd without the smoke they were up there you could not see them\nAnd without the smoke I could still see goes

Adam and Eve away from God to get them scraps out of the book of\nLife and so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are aligned um is when this can happen\nAgain is just a theory that's pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have it or bad because you know what\nThe light does it need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are\nAre these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book um uh of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to do to duplicate that experience yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could but you could\nUm it was um\nOh ... let me just tell them so I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George alright I'll tell them we have a couple of minutes\nOh what's up with the blackout\nOh I'm Sorry [noise] when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I so how how about you just tell everybody and sort of is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said I saw the ... man again\nAnd and he spoke to me\nAnd what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what\nHe said tell her my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my ex step dad who was not\nVery nice [noise] and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was my step dad but I think it was the ... man who knows\nI Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you right there find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we wouldn't weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I
