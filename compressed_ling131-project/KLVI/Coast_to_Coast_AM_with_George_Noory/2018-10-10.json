impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consulting Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from Google Plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago I'm going to be missed\nWas if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on\nBut sizes everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical vulnerability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well\nWhy stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why it's her petition and they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have\nDiscussed that publicly or the first place\nUm and uh it would have been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things and I'll mention that there the Google commercial versions of Google Plus which operates further Gees we the the\nThe business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head music of that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially\nOr and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks her was probably about a good idea in the first place at the time at ... at the end at the time that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out\nBut as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that enormous

evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell the ... cycle couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect I think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago\nDuring the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're\nThe ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter or with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in presents men experiments measuring the skin response\nMuseum work now cycle can nieces\nThe ability to move objects with your brain what did you uncover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and\nI think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for the mind\nThat matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators that these are machines that spit out the heroes and one's in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once in a zero\nAgain what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nYeah in ... people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of\nAnd study where the machine the random number generators were set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around an event\nThat we know a produce heightened emotion and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a hunting trip basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone the focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven\nWhich is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened for\nThe plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to have\nHer in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else with his

of of\nFood and bending party which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a

difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up short this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it gets into a window into a reality that we typically do it with our eyes I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known at ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ... hated and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for Apple Dr ... and ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and described near death experience and why is that significant\nIn cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma and medicate and the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stops functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found that the paper later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being\nStamps and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this new doesn't experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories are but\nWhat I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular who's\nLooked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark who you are on six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic\nYou've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist Anna materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ease\nAnd uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious as goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious and she was like there is no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be\nSenior Larry to you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically\nI liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded than Xanax or at antidepressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter]\nBack chemically the brain and therefore they do affect\nChemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches going back to psych made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in fact the mine that's my first part my second part\nOf the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia\nAffects the brain does affect the conscious is The Mind's a dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something that you address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether\nIt's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation\nIn other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically concluded that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire\nMore firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain and a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness you damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark of reincarnation well I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children are and it just does remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nI'm In er sometimes there are five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so\nSomething that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm

the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal of pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such\nA taboo topic well Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is what he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well\nWe haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything to travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nThat there are things in the ... and the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically this has opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves that to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again one more time you bought your Web site where people can

from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic tranche medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with Maureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nI Know as you're reading that I'm\nThinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right [laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen\nYou know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high ... salmon and feel\nOften when I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed and her her guide and very regal looking very on you know she's a big prize on ...\nAnd ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town in Salem not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to\nBe at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft\nAnd um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of ... and then it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town of them\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said the civility what year are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought the girls in the same\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was saying and I mean it was normal I did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say are here some holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her and she finally told me that if you don't want Marlene ... from\nMy family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nYou're waiting for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio so\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people who I heard that you know she was very trusted\nIn her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by and my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the others that you could carry through\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and ah I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and that she was maybe maybe five years\nAnd it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true so she was very unique 'cause that's what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nNow you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he's started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um\nYou know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individual that you know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to gather you'd go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to [noise]\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just the off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using them\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command um so I really believe that\nThere are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nMore than you conclude about what this may be are we a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes jar what do you think there\nWell I think there are varying degrees of what they could be right\nSo our experience in my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there is different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them\nUm we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door you know door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of\nThe head with a a ballot stress from the stairs or you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent knife\nSo after a few minutes and thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to\nUse them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um he leaves Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any rags me down on the on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you come back here tonight by yourself\nAnd I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you got to be careful\nYou know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want\nYou here and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary hey we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast\nWent into a\nBox News I'm

and I'm a member of the Mets came in and she told her all about uh\nHow that used to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of a floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished their little spiel on one side and then I get up and began to talk it suicide began to speak one of the books from behind me came flying\nIn la la la until the middle of Rome in front of thirty five peas and there's no way they would just fall\nNo it didn't it was like just fall down behind me I mean I was they come fly and by the end\nLike somebody was throwing

there was somebody back [laughter] tossing him at you\nI'd certainly looked ... so you know but that was just the ...\n... what has for you that you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr ... or did\nNot by the by the living room\nAnd I first book uh goes chronicles is\n... is the second book on the series a marine and I did an investigation that was the daytime investigations jumped him and called me up and\nMe to check out his house so I get married you know we went to his house and places and mess with it looked like it had been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... and the the kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and\nUh one of them move separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and so he wanted marina comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fear was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's wonderful left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very on on on the particular case uh\nThe you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more pieces equipment or\nThe small cage the lesser amount but you always want to um you know tried to bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance if you have reports of a ... be unseen\nYou might bring more video equipment or thermal or I or whatever\nBut you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio cut me so it it it varies avoiding gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the worst in the visualization of a visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ghost hunting but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White Houses or a funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions when I Do these goes to his own board of directors of Bush on top of a white\nHouse that we do these hearted tours and one time we were in this um [noise]\nIt's a like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you\nAnd says windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and those who want to do it in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down to the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself as she came and they didn't want her to missing anything so I stopped and waited for a night at CERN continually walk all the way to do it and I waited and waited\nAnd yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my bill to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough\nThat said vocation is where the coast got because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reported seeing woman walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing um\nPerhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes typed on uh what Iowa lighthouse in Bedford pool meal I mean we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was under\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting at a picnic table in the in\nThe room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen I serve dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no there\nWas no sounded outside jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd when the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman and she says right would you see that's just that's our dog she says ... to describe it sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe that dog she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the lighthouse keepers afterward took care of them until the dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you described pretty much matches\nBecause she has a dog but that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it's certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both the euro will

and we're going to take your phone calls as well more goes chronicles Maureen say hello to run\nA Ron how're you doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter] so how often do you get the calls Ron for ghost investigations\nKnow it it it's funny when we first started we we ... it was quite common but are there are so many group so like when I first started I always say that was\nA twenty ... you have to do was knew there was like twenty four in the country knows like twenty four and a new city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael is

dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring nothing dumb from four to nothing\nSo that would be good [laughter]\nWe've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do anything because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go to a big location you have to know a where the cost of tree you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate your audio recorder serve\nIf for a visual phenomena or in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I Try to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for\nLack of it or are you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for you know strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you to hear from people but you know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nThose the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us and uh and I very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house ... something we're not going to do it do you know a a refer him someone else [noise]\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California walking to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call but um yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life\nAnd I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see the year next coming or being a lot better [laughter] hopefully\nThings starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nThat's for sure yes [laughter] yes it was um okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt\nThat have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of a poll is you know this was last year now and things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I wouldn't tell you is that for you can get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put on a mask but you're not feeling it is that correct or no\n[noise] uh right [laughter] yeah okay\nRight so put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you have to go to person it feels like a lot of people are the ones that come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone I was there\nYeah yeah [laughter]\nOkay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balancing your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron ... the these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter]\nIt it doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think while it's October Halloween season right we need to be out there\nUm and I'd say over the years that might have started when I joined the group it was more it was busier around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably busy constantly\nMaureen what do you think of ...\n[laughter] funny you bring that up um you know I think that they're a tool I don't think that's something to be afraid of them I just think it's it's the intention that you use\nWhen you're using that we'd be bored so if you're you know you're drinking and you're using the ... then that's probably not a good idea um because
