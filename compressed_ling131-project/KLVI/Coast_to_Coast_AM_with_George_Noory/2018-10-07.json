with rich village in\nKaty tool more than ever driver seen motives and broadcasters are engaged with fast thanks to social media similar on line heroes while others are online zeroes let's run down the week of the week as we welcome in Katy told what is up Katie how are you this way\nHey I'm doing good I had a had a good cowboys weekend here in Texas in the great race to watch it with\nIts own all good weekend is definitely was some wild racing there on the role of on Sunday or we'll talk a little bit\nMore about the implications of that race coming up at our next segment we've also got the new rules package for twenty nine team that a Bob but I just talked about will try to explain to the little bit more detail ah during our news ah from the garage segment right now though it has to wait for the week you can follow along on my Twitter feed ... or ...\nAll right so the obvious uh God we have to start tweets with is Ryan Delaney and he said what a crazy race had some a lot on our side but put ourselves in a position to capitalize on an opportunity\nHappy for this twelve team and excited to move on to the next round of great to have most of the family there too and I he added about four or five pictures there from victory line and he did he had all the family there which is definitely exciting for him\nBut I like what he said here I mean obviously he wasn't technically in contention for on that last last night to win but he did he put himself in the best position possible and sometimes especially on those rode horses those things happen ah\nHe needs to send a bouquet of flowers\nTo Jimmy Johnson and sharing him for that when he has a little different take on Jimmy Martin tricks did yeah\nIt does with speaking of Jimmy Johnson tweet it out and said everyone makes mistakes apology to the Seventy eight and all of their fans um which obviously that just last minute going trying to you know go for the when he ends up wrecking not only himself at Martin church junior and they're both out of that so\nI was I was just surprised she did I understand he's trying to win yeah dude you had no chance survey and I'm\nSorry to at this point when it's ... it's an elimination rain would have been fine finishing second direct to go into the next round and now he is eliminated from playoff so it definitely ah from such a veteran too surprising new but um he continued the next morning and said\nAfter sleeping on it I Would only change one thing I should have added front brake bias heading into the breaking down I think we would have been door to door with the Seventy eight across to start finish line bring on Dover\nYeah 'cause that was the other thing when he locked up his breaks initially was weird that it was his rear breaks yeah that were locking up and I guess he felt that he could have been better with more front brake I I still and you know\nBob ... said this in the last segment it it's not like he's sitting there threatening to win the championship any way with the way round this year by\nIn the in the second round he is the best at Dover with the most wins in the third round he has the most wins a Texas and he's been really good aboard Israel so he had chances to advance and those other around yeah and I just think you try to stay alive for another day but I guess when you have seven championships it's easy to make the decision that I'm not worried about that I Want to ... when another race\nRight which I definitely understand but um it is it's one of those things you look at and it's like hey what this new format the way the playoffs work you need to win but you need to get to the next\nRound to give yourself a chance you know we'll see that but it just uh you know and I'm sure a part of it too late for an exciting robo\n\nTold you my son came out of his room upstairs ask what was wrong when I watch it\nOn wrong and just watching the crazy race that\nAnd Eric all role or I Know those people and then they add the replay of car Larson a bounce off a wall to get to the finish loner he's so good call Larson who would've ever thought he needed to pass Jeffrey Earnhardt of all people right right right it was a one car he was able to pass a\nThank goodness because I was happy to see him stay alive in the playoffs yeah well oh okay so Fox on NASCAR they have this like on race had this um where they they they pick basically starting this now we're going around a twelve year going ahead and guessing the next round of eight\nAnd it's about a five minute clip I encourage you to watch it definitely dramatic music and very um like uh\nWho wants what's said that he wants to be a millionaire\nAlready like that are on a music yeah intent\nIt's with the panel that includes good for the total access Adam Alexander yes Larry ... a mic rentals Andy patriot Casey ... and Michael Wolff wrote\nYet so long story short to sum this up they basically shoe and um they all have to agree and it's like a voting system who they think will make it to the next routes they're the ones they all agreed on where Carl Bush Martin checks junior Kevin Harvey ... Kurt Busch ... then\nThey all were pretty on board with that the last ... they're trying to decide between Ryan Delaney chase Eliot and Clint ... we've got Michael ... and ...\nYears yet and they both vote in Ryan Delaney but then our other to you on the other side I'm a ...\nYet end up voting and chase Eliot so it comes down to Adam Alexander and he makes a comment basically I'm going to go with a as of late\nIt inconsistency he votes in chase Eliot so they're they're picked final lay all in good fine well Ryan blaming doesn't really like that and he read tweets it and says I sure hope to prove you all wrong once again\nSimple enough Adam Alexander respond to that and he said I\nHave tremendous confidence in your ability to make us look foolish you already did whites which I liked that thought it was a great a response and I love Ryan Delaney he sell T this week it was about ten forty at night so I'm not saying they were beers involved or anything but it's been a little liquid courage\nBecause he respond directly to Adam Alexander and says\nApparently not enough confidence\nSo he does not like that he's not being picked to win or at least to advance and nice and uh I don't know young guy lot the guts but basically Michael Wall chair was the one who made the case for ... like I'm going with momentum he's coming off of when I mean not that has a lot to do with the way to the playoffs after work so\nWe'll see we'll see who gets pre wrong and right um I don't know are we going to uh we can either play I play the actual audio about how Bush instant anti Bush had a really exciting news\nYeah they they posted a video this week Kyle did of the two of them I did not realize they did in vitro fertilization for ... and so they're doing it again and they're just they're hoping to share their journey because there's lots of other people that go through this too so it was really sweet of them it was super\nSweet and and I did I thought it was something that was really great to highlight because I'm like you said people don't always think that um and their world with lots of money lots of things that they have to go through the same thing so they're going to be extremely open about that journey and I can't wait to follow all my prayers for them and they're hoping for a baby girl Samantha says you need more pink and glitter in\nHer life so it's pretty cute um last that not least meet Jeff ... awesome I watch this and thought oh no watch out for the robo wall and it is a video of Casey Gane testing their Charlotte and he is full line towards what we all

motor speedway total access was rich Phyllis and Katy\nTold it's on to another ... which means another test for the monster energy NASCAR cup series let's find out who's one before and whom I voted this week in the race set up for the rich in\nCases over international speedway is where they run this Sunday the gander outdoors four hundred and one o'clock central time on NBC or send\nUs is the first time playoff race number four has been at Dover and it'll be a different track to host the fourth race previously Dover was the third race to the playoffs from Tony elaborate of Seventeen and was the second race in two thousand four to one ten\nEleven different drivers have won the playoff races at Dover five of the eleven are contenders this year the round of twelve brackets Laskey Kevin Hart Kurt Busch\nKyle Busch and Martin tricks junior\nThe worst finishing a playoff raised over by a driver that went on to win the title was twenty fifth by Tony Stewart back at twenty eleven and never has a non playoffs driver won the playoff race\nAt Dover a Dover is one mile with twenty four degree banking at each end nine degree banking on each of the straight away is that it's completely symmetrical with a front stretch into back stretch the same length of just over one thousand feet\nThe official opening of Dilbert international speedway Nineteen sixty nine and in July of that year Richard Petty one the first cup races up first cup race there\nOr they used to run five hundred miles from Nineteen Seventy one until Ninety seven when I think they made a good choice to go down or a hundred miles on these races\nNinety set a cup races have been run their four hundred one drivers have been in at least one race there Matt cans that leads active drivers with thirty eight starts at Dover thirty ... thirty five different drivers have won a Jimmy Johnson this is one of the five tracked sees the all time leader in wins a left in\n... ... ... Jimmy\nThat a lot of wins there uh fifty one never drivers have finishes the runner up mark Martin leads in that with eight ... acted drivers and runner than issues for\nJimmy Johnson him at camp America's lead actor drivers with Seventeen top bonds and Johnson and cans of lead actor drivers with twenty four tops hands\nChased Eliot leads an average finish at five point zero\nI Will say Kyle Busch once again this week though it ... uh although I really thought about Harvey to cause harm one the first time this year uh it'll be against Sunday afternoon one central time it's on NBC s in as they run the gander outdoors four hundred at Dover or next week\nGot it but a lot of importance on this week being over because next week's Talladega ... and not a good or not to go to play for a playoff drivers sometimes because you never know at Talladega\nLet's go to some news from the garage a NASCAR announcing their new rules package for twenty ninth team this week you got all this Katie or you're going to get us all the details\nHe showed me the side by side picture which was actually very helpful\nSo and Bob Bob ... person I talked about this earlier on the show and if you go look him up on ESPN dot com you can get a lot of good information about it so what they're doing here\nThey're going to slow the cars down essentially so I don't know that it'll necessarily bring down the average last time that much because I don't know that they're going to get slowed down a whole lot in terms of sometimes it's the overall speed they're using instead of stricter plate\nA tapered space or which will reduce horse power in the engine\nMany tracts there's a next year from seven hundred and fifty to five hundred and fifty horse power they're also going to add downpours which is going to help\nBring the cars to gather they believe in the more tighter racing they're doing it with a spoiler that they had been reducing reducing reducing on the back of that car for years down to two point three seven five inches it's got to go to eight inches next year it looks like what's on the trucks now\nAnd it sounds crazy because it's gotten like you said it's ... like you almost expected to disappear but then he reappeared in a very big way three times the size of what it has been there\nAll the arrow decks arrow ducks on the front of the car to disperse air around the wheel wells and create more down for the split or is actually getting larger began from a quarter inch of up to two inches that's on the bottom at the front of the car again more down forced the goal is to make tighter racing but also allow for passing\nA by leaving 'cause his arm restrict and by the way this is the biggest news I thought\nThe the restrict or pay raises they only they tone is going to have a restrict or play with this year's package the rest of the races next year on the ah restrict replace tracks\nOr science as eighty seven they will run without a plate wow 'cause they're restricted plate reduces the down to about four hundred and fifty horse power the problem I have there is you can't pass without any help right and if you lose the draft or dead right I Believe with a five hundred and fifty horse power they'll get a lot better\nBrought a response to get acceleration okay and it should allow guys to be able to pass some without drafting held but they still believe this will bring the\nMaybe I'll hold your hand at the big change you made an interesting comment about about they change maybe bringing people who don't necessarily know ins and outs into sports\n... the thing about it is people that aren't paying attention to us talking about what are you not know that NASCAR may have quote manufactured some things to make the racing tighter they see you next year wow look at how close this race is ... it may help to draw some people back it's a big gamble I think but NASCAR\nA but they're going to try next year with the reduced horse power is that the big thing is you're not going to sit there and watch the car and know what's going slower\nRight now they're they're fast regardless\nThey're still going to be doing a hundred and Ninety hundred Ninety five on our straight in a in a real big clumps yes so\nUh we'll see what it brings her twenty ninth team a couple of quick no secret news for the garage this week Casey Cain not clear to return at Dover we saw the video of is\nTested Charlotte this week still having issues from that are extreme heat exhaustion that he suffered at darling should a few weeks ago so Reagan Smith going to run that Ninety five car or a fifth consecutive week\nAnd a ... changing up their track for next year they're going to go back to adding their whole track lay out it was originally used would open a Nineteen sixty eight\nBut NASCAR hadn't been using the carousel since they went back in Nineteen Ninety eight Indy Car has\nThey're going to bring the carousel back next year for the Toyota said more at three fifty\nWhich should add to I'm a little bit of the drama of that road course I'd always happy to see Daniel hammered get promoted this past week and next year sure Richard showed us racing has had him in the ... series the last two years the second and points right now and he's going to replace the departing Ryan Newman in that number thirty water\nDaniel guy who some were wondering if he missed

course is W. W. W. dot art bell dot com W. W. W. dot art bell no space dot com now Lynn Buchanan\nHe was a remote viewers for projects Stargate from Nineteen eighty four through early Ninety two wild part of military intelligence for the U.S army\nEvolution as a viewer of viewing instructor for new personnel and a viewer profile database manager as well as other miscellaneous duties when he retired from the army remote viewing was still classified\nAfter retirement from military service in Nineteen Ninety two he founded the aid W. P.\nTo assist civilian intelligence police FBI and so forth in locating missing children and founded PSI to develop solutions for intelligence related data analysis\nPrior to the facts about project Stargate being declassified he trained only those people who were in a position to know about that technology\nA Joseph mcgonigle was uh\nBorn January ten Nineteen forty six in Miami, Florida he voluntarily joined the U.S army and was recruited by the army of Security Agency for classified assignments\nOr he do you eventually get evaluated to a project Stargate while there he earned a legion of merit for providing critical intelligence reported that the highest echelons of our military and government\nIncluding such national level agencies as the joint chiefs of staff DIA and as a CIA and the secret service producing crucial and vital intelligence unavailable from any other source\nWhen he retired in Nineteen eighty four he maintained his association with Stargate or in general the program through his own company in to the intelligence applications\nAnd now Paul Smith Paul\nServed in the Fort Mead a remote viewing program Stargate September of eighty three to August of Nineteen Ninety and was trained in the RV by NGOs swan\nPrimary author of the government's the RV training manual he also served as theory instructor for new C.

[laughter] I guess it is a sense of the word\nHuh All right ah in order that you know this is not TV so in order that we might tell you apart if wasn't responding to something you would say this is Leon or Joe or Paul you'd would be awfully helpful I think for the audience um\nSo what I'd like to let you guys do is sort of banter back and forth and what we must begin with is explaining to the audience um what remote viewing is who's good at doing that\nOh this is Joe ... okay I'd like to answer that\nIf I could I'm In my opinion what remote what differentiates remote viewing for normal psychic functioning is the remote viewing is usually done within a control protocol\nAnd the protocol is essentially been the same and has been on trains them so the original a research into remote viewing and Nineteen Seventy two Sri\nUh one of the things that dictates remote that dictates the protocol is that remote viewing is uh usually done blind with the subject and uh there are specific requirements that go along with the protocol that are generally not violated\nA generally not violated all three of you have gone from the military Stargate Program into individual endeavors in civilian life have any of the three of you in any way significant or not modified the protocols are in your civilian endeavors\nUh this is Len let me answer that um [noise] when I was in the service or working there as database manager um the NGOs one technique is a largely intuitive\nAnd uh and and several spots it's not at all logical and as a result of saying that uh\nMany many times when people will improve on it and watching the database each time I've seen the results go down um\nI have a kept as strictly as possible to the uh NGOs swan technology now I've added a few things that take the information and ah and expound upon it but as far as the\nExcuse me as far as the basic uh a technology itself wouldn't change it for the world\nUh this is Paul I'm it might be useful to to clarify something here um we're actually dealing with a couple of different approaches to remote reviewing a Joe uses a one approach a linen I use another\nWe learned ours are essentially from English swan uh it's called controlled remote viewing I used to be called coordinate remote viewing\nJoe uses another a technique which I I don't know what he calls that we tend to call it back in the unit the E R B or extended remote viewing or the goal of both approaches is to essentially control the process\nThe our three former Stargate\nProject Stargate remote viewers when Buchanan Joe mcgonigle

Monica ... oh who even one time scored one hundred percent on ah\nFifty two courage while I was very very impressed I should someday reached that did did you say one hundred percent or there was one instance in the database where he got one hundred percent correct so it can be don't want\nOf the this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about the accuracy of [noise]\nI've been working for over Thirteen Years with the cognitive science is way up in California that that's the original founders of the original research\nDoing uh we we've collected statistics on on dozens of remote yours or what I Would call world classroom outdoors are generally speaking a on an average a very good remote viewer can be expected to make contact with the target site about sixty sixty five percent of the time\nAnd out of the information they provide a the the accuracy of the information will run anywhere from thirty five to eighty eight percent now there there are times when the good remote viewer will get a hundred percent or near a hundred percent quality remote viewing but those are extremely rare\nAnd when someone establishes there and they're sort of history over a long period of time say turn to a Nineteen years ah that that's the kind of percentage as you can expect\nMore of those percentages increased with a team\nOr the giggle factor goes up when someone starts talking about [noise] psychics sure and nobody has a political career wants to be caught dead standing next to any of those like it's\nA in fact we had tremendous support from the Senate on down\nIn a in some very important positions in government and when those people were asked to respond in particular to the Nightline program or without exception all of them responded positively but refused to go on the air or state that probably [noise]\nAll right I'm not surprised um you all three of you have now turned to sue the civilian application for a remote viewing um\nAre there are there other ethical and moral limits or if I Walk into one of your organization's with a whole ... bundle of money and I say look I Want to know what it means to me she was going to produce in the following area what they're doing will you do that for me\nUh this is Lynn I um have very definite moral and ethical limitations there are certain things I Will not teach a and basically during the span of course just a learning the basics\nThere is so much to learn that uh you don't really have time to learn all of those esoteric things anyway are\nNow as gives me a million ... wait a there are certain things you will teach\nOh I Do not oh\nEven address the subject of remote influencing and won't um\nOh all three of you I take it agree remote influencing which means uh by the way folks the ability at a distance or to influence what somebody else actually does not just read their mind but influenced their mind not only that it is possible\nRemember it's not remote control it's remote influence and understand\nRight oh the um go ahead and uh I Want to ah make one thing very clear by the way of keeping the database I kept all of the information on all the projects and at no time\nWas there ever and official\nTasking to our unit or done by our unit or involving remote influencing anything that was done that was done by individuals on their own time and there was some experimentation and so forth but at no time where we ever\nTask to do that\nWell would it be your view Lynn a unofficially that remote influencing is possible\nI Believe so I uh have collected the data and tried the experiments and have come to the conclusion that it's extremely past\nMy God then you know I I again this brings me back to the military's a parent dismissal of this remote influencing would be of such intense interest to them or that it just seems impossible to me that they would not fully explore it\nWell if you're a politician funding\nSomething would you want to get caught funding remote influencing on me\nOr I don't think any politician does and of course anytime you do something and government there's always the chance of a leak and somebody finding out\nBut then again they let it go death sure but they don't want to get caught selling missiles to Iran either well he did and that's right and our government does lots of things that it it might not otherwise want to get caught at and the idea of being able to remotely in ... influence of Boris Yeltsin ah or Saddam Hussein or any of the other big guys\nThis is Joe I'd like to comment on that from a science standpoint sure um I ... as I said before I I've been over Thirteen Years with a cognitive science lab and\nUh there there are a number of labs across America um that has been involved in a remote doing research and many of those labs have tried some some experimentation in the remote influencing arena\nThere has been some some very interesting and provocative results which are still very much up in the air [noise]\nUh so if you were to say absolutely we can prove remote influencing you would have to say no we can't but if you said that there probably that there is a high probability that it's possible you would have to say yes but all the research is an and yet\nThere are all based on that uh I don't know how you would actually apply it and uh be expected of a a a an ability to validate the outcome\nThat's right um and the experimentation I've done a the experimentation I Know is completely full of holes and could be shot down by a\nYou know junior ... scientist who ah but ah I have a done the experiment to my satisfaction are now believe that it can be done and quite easily oh but as far as proof\nI'm Still waiting for prove myself\nUm our president has done from time to time over the last several years things that seem utterly uncharacteristic how many of you had anything to do with that\n[laughter] that I [laughter] other than with my vote\nNo [laughter] All right I'm without naming anybody a would one of you say Oh yes I definitely in my own mind I Believe that I definitely remotely influence somebody's action [noise]\nOh this is what I was saying I convinced myself that it does work uh-huh um\nHowever let me again repeat that it was never official never official ...\nOne of ... this is Joe or one of the problems here are is\nUm when you start talking about remote influencing of other individuals and then you bring in uh integrity and uh yeah and that sort of thing as a ... ethics ... one of the problems that you become very heavily embroiled in especially within America\nAnd especially within research um is the fact that there are human use considerations that taken into consideration\nAnd as soon as soon as you are sort of formally identify someone to participate in such an experiment you have to tell them for what's going on All right\nGentlemen hold tight oh we'll be right back is premier network that was art bell hosting coast to coast am on this somewhere in time

pretty closely to the NGO swan structure mhm and I'm a retains the the uh\nTerminology that NGO used\nNo right so in other words there is not a lot of difference\nThere's not a lot now and go ah requested that people not use his terminology and so uh I started using\nBasically a slang terms that the students developed oh for instance a analytic overlay which is basically your imagination taken over oh ah my students\nCalled stray cats and so I took over the terminology simply because and go\nOh put out I'm a\nLittle basic letter saying please don't use my terminology mhm and ah so\nAh basically oh I Would say as far as terminology goes it is more edges closer to the original than than anything I teach um\nOh All right man I measure was there I think they're basically the same\nAlright may I ask this of all of you why do remote viewers generally not love each other\n[laughter] well uh let me let me address that ah I've been watching this on the net\nWait a minute who is this oh I'm Sorry this is Lyn Lyn okay I've been\nWatching this on the net and ah if you look very closely or the the\nConcept or the feeling that over ... years or squared off at each other is a form of sort of this information in itself okay the ah\nPeople who are squared off at each other's seemed to be a at squared off that Dave Dave squared off it it ah it and I had a ... and Joe ... and\nUh I think soon to be at and Paul oh and and uh several other people and if you may notice a pattern grew in there\nOh why do you guys let me restructure the question what are you guys not love it\nThere are several reasons one I'm a [noise] for one thing oh when he got out of service have started ah\nThey started giving plush about information to the public oh I'm a while it was still classified\nUh he uh is making claims that he oh ran the project that he started the project that it was you know that he brief the president and and I mean these are laughable things\nOf it not happen you say not true or not true All right uh I'd\nLike to make a comment here as well uh this is Joe ... is also made claims that I've worked for him and uh got sort of thing and those are in fact we not\nTrue statements yeah he said I worked for him to and I didn't [laughter]\nAll right here's the facts are we going to go as has said that ... or ... was never a remote viewer ah with the government but was simply a person who was employed interview prospective candidates for the government remote viewing program could you please ask him to comment on that\nThis look look let me jump in the halls around this is Paul okay well that's actually not completely correct in the snow is probably Joe's because they didn't overlap had came in on the scene a long after Joe was gone\nIt actually did indeed do did participate in some operational what we're doing projects however that wasn't his primary function or he was indeed a a\nA more an analyst task or managing training and stuff you know he did he he he was kind of a Jack of all trades in that regard he wasn't\nHired primarily as a rule viewer and only under exceptional circumstances that you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational during I got that he did one\nThe ... uh no you argue that you crisis on for\nOn for a number or um I haven't gone through the list but uh I'd say uh\nI saw at least six or seven that he was a list as a viewer on all I really I didn't have that and I didn't remember that from a database of ... this is Joe I'd like to comment on my comment [laughter]\nAh that's not an exact quote for what I said All right um the claim was made a um buy at a\nDams that that he was the only person who who was qualified the trainer or teacher of the people who are remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote viewer in up in the project and the only one who was\nA responsible your and my comment was that his primary job while he was with the unit was to to act as a monitor and interface with the\nThe viewer in terms of the ... are setting up remote feelings and that he was not a primary trainer he may have trained\nOr in the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing and and that's OK that everybody had specific jobs within the unit 'em and every one performed as they were required and I suspect that he perform\nYou know righteously ended the job or very well [laughter] ah or I have a problem is where he makes claims then then attributes them to himself when they're in fact I don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with this any more today\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you not referred to as deems as Dr Doom\nOr this was a nickname that was given to him and the unit before he came to us or he was a it was called Dr Doom over there ah he's been predicting doom death and destruction for years and years and years now\nUh-huh or would you say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen\nThat would be a perception this was a a\nN and that's fine um what one of the remarkable things about remote doing is that when you when you make up production or you make a statement about something a one would hope that there would be some validity or some method by which you could prove whether you're the veracity of the information shore or I could\nCertainly choose or pick targets that are completely on verifiable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a opening yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense that danger\nUm he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so call [laughter] um and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out he accepts a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more\nSitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic ability\nAnd deems has said I accept\nI called the amazing Randy so called and asked him to come on he settled socks and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell add to come up with these numbers I said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that so how about coming on the program and setting up\nA structured test uh with the controls set up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program I'm do any of you feel that\nThe amazing Randy's challenge could be a taken and met\nA as it stands a he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind\nUh and if you if anyone does things on his terms oh he wins I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate or\nDoing it on his terms you'd you'd uh\nYou'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick\nA you know that he uses for\nFor his own a popularity and so forth\nOK buddy that yes but if if the controls were set up a independently uh from Mr Randy\nThen he wouldn't participate in the eye\nAnd so that's why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about that he he doesn't except the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs in the world\nAnd so he's not hardly going to come on your show art in in establishing a valid or reasonable protocol and allow someone to attempt to do the revolt doing\nSo I have to support it in in a in this because\nA copy of New York times from may\nA march of Nineteen Ninety four talking about a frog mutations and another one from the Associated Press on Ninety five talking about it well or you know I can remote do things that have already happened anybody can do that or that's easy\n[laughter] oh right oh\nCan you know it's easy to predict things that have already happened oh\nAll right let me let me pull away from this are you guys are going to have ... have already having too much fun with this [laughter] um let's talk about the past for a second one obvious target in the past of immense interests to people worldwide is whether there was really a man who walked the earth\nWho was the son of God called Christ or it must have been a for you at some time and in evidently tempting target [noise]\nUm this is Lynn oh I had done a series of uh of sessions on oh Colombian drug lords uh Hussein cut off and so forth and uh was\nTalking about Lynn may I interrupt you because we're the bottom

had remote viewed Jesus was he on this earth was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nI'm this is Len yes Lynn a I had started a a an old war story here uh I had been doing the bad guys for for weeks and weeks and I went into the director and I said look\nI I Believe are based on my remote during my experiences that uh that UFOs or real uh let me say that up front I have not seen any evidence that there aliens associated with UFO phenomena I've not seen direct proof of that\nHowever are within the context of aliens I Would have to say that ah also based on my experiences um I Believe that there are a entities that people would perhaps ... million\nBut that doesn't get guarantee that there extraterrestrial they could be um it could be essentially time travelers a extra dimensional a\nProjections x-ray almost anything and I don't think\nWe possess efficient proof to say one way or the other yet what they might get an answer Joe\nI'm very however all of you agree there is certainly something out there other than us\nWell this is Joe again I'm ... this isn't a new issue are this is this has been around for two thousand years that we know of and it will continue to be around because those are simply experiences that are that people are having\nIn a while we may not be able to say specifically very much specifically about it other than they are experiences doesn't mean that it should not be properly investigated or or looked at\nWhat happens unfortunately is that a lot of the data is a is a mixed with this information or it's collected improperly or poorly and and we wind up with some very interesting uh concepts about it but we we don't\nWe'll get any closer to the truth\nOr are there are there are aspects of uh Stargate that history of you are still unable to discuss publicly\nYes of course I Would have to say about Ninety five percent of it\nOn my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed that's\nA generally so yes well that here's Paul um the the biggest ... of of material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves and the reason for that is not the connection with remote viewing but the connection was other intelligence sources and means\nUm if there is material on some of that some of those projects that would that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability it might have disclosed the existence of some human source that we have you know and\nAnd a human outside I'm at risk or you know ... there's a lot of stuff in there that wasn't even involved with what we're doing that that is sensitive to end are important to ah American security [noise] I Would agree with that\nYou made a rather startling statement one of you or that it deems you felt disclosed some classified material before it's time oh well this is Lynn Lynn\nI'm not only on a on a few uh T. V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows\nBut also um I was down in Atlanta one time a working with a student and I had the chance to meet a person named uh Courtney Brad ... who was going to put out a book or this book was about the Stargate project\nAnd he asked me to take a a copy of the manuscript that he had and read it\nAnd then the first chapter of the manuscript no remember everything was still classified highly classified\nI'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nOh I went back and I said I said Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh and uh you know if you do though they'll confiscate your book or something in in any way that got him to take that first chapter out mhm\nOh I ask him where did you get this information and he said well I got it from it\nOh\nWhen I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst\nTrees and that any agent could ever do\nWas give the names of the other agents or I mean you you you bite the sign a pill and die before you do that and yet here was the entire list uh\nFor the purpose of being published while this was still a a a classified thing now the reason that upset me so much was because um of another incident where it at a meeting had gotten up and told what I had done a\nAgainst Hussein and I called him on the phone and I should add\nThese are crazy people with guns and uh I've got a family here and he just blew it off well the only purpose I could find for giving those names to coordinate the publishing the book while it was still classified\nOh deals with the idea of targeting for remote viewing\nOr if you have a name basically you have an address and a the a history of Russian\nOh or psychology has been more aimed at remote influencing\nThan a remote viewing or data collection and a\nA show and I could still find no other reason for giving that information to court and they then to have something happened to us and uh that upset me very much and uh uh I stayed around hook coordinate not only took the first chapter out\nBut also deleted it from his computer ah I wanted to make absolutely certain that was completely gone\nLook guys over at the top of the hour anybody here have to bail out or can you stick around a little bit\n[noise] I can stay on for a while on all ... All right\nDon a then they're they are [noise] this is kind of a gathering of the eagles something you will not frequently hear Brahms never has been done before I don't know [noise]\nMy guests Marlin Buchanan Joe ... will get that eventually and Paul Smith [noise] all three in the military projects known as ... ...\nIs premier networks that was art bell who's being coast to coast am on the [noise] somewhere in time\n\nWhether in sports for sale he sections online and on the air news on five sixty hail vi home I I hardly and you'll see\n\n...

A. S. C. dot com she'll em slash\nTold a C. S. L. slash index I N D E X. dot H. T. M.

R. viewer and then it ends with a slash\nA can any of you remote view of the day when these damn world Wide Web addresses will get shorter and easier [laughter] All right we will get those up I'm\nNow before we leave the subject of aliens or dimensional beings or whatever it is that you all sins and agree or would be out there a one obvious target in this area\nOr would have been the Roswell episode and I've got a a person vaccine me from Los Angeles saying uh somebody must have tackled that one has anybody looked at Roswell in it so ... what have you determined\nUh I can I can respond to that first I guess this is Joe okay Joe\nI'm I I had a private client who actually targeted me against Roswell and uh at the time I of course was totally blind to the actual target\nAnd uh what I produced was essentially a very accurate description of the location\nThat was being targeted in Roswell which was the believe crash site uh there were some indications that there probably was an incident there but it did not involve an alien craft it involves a\nA possible ... collusion between uh uh some earth earth bound traffic and probably involved a some materials that were sensitive [noise]\nEnhance or then of course the story about the weather balloon\nYes I ... the data I had to not specifically match a weather balloon but uh it it did a indicate that there was probably any that but it was probably not a ... a alien associated\nSorry fought Joe I'm ... you from Orange County aren't in reading ... book mind track which by the way I thought was a great book he talks about a stage in which he sees creatures or goals for spirits\nAnd uh the person wants to know does everybody who remote views eventually get there\nUh in in regard to what what their referencing are uh some chapters in near where I was discussing a my interaction with what you might call entities that uh took this took place essentially as an experience outside of remote doing All right I Want to make it very clear\nAll while these these may have been a personal experience on what I think is bell and [noise] ah they they were not the separation was not obtained a severe um appealing [noise] um\nI I Believe it it's my personal belief a based on Nineteen years of participation in the project and in the remote during that I've done it's my personal belief that um that we are by nature are essential existing in two worlds a one foot physical and one foot in the spiritual\nAnd to ignore the experiences from a spiritual side would be taught him out to cutting off the left leg so to speak\nOn right now I hear well then here's another good question other than the remote viewing\nOf Christ um\nKent any of you or do any of you aside from your personal religious beliefs are in in in the context of remote viewing ... or is it possible to confirm the fact that there is life beyond the physical\nI I I Will answer that uh this is Joe again I'm In my opinion yes uh\nBut it's not life as we know the physical and it's it's obviously something else right and uh I I Believe that uh we do have frequent interactions with or what might be termed as as entities or spiritual being\nAnd that uh they have profound impact on us as a spiritual\nSpiritual beings ourselves in that those types of experiences or have the because of the profound impact of them have exactly the same effect as if you were run over by a Mack truck in the world so they should be paid attention to 'em and that's up to each individual as to what they do with that\nAll right this is for all three of you are in the process of learning or a in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm\nI don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced myself or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous I Know there are claims out there to the contrary but ah um you know I I just don't know where that is coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that uh uh would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] uh this is land could I jump in here for a second\nGuess um [noise]\nFor each person when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are things that your subconscious and conscious of been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with or any real danger that comes to a person I think is basically\nCaused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring the danger that is then let loose um\nI have never had any or even actually known any person who has had a a a remote view in session where the session itself or the target itself a had a\nHad a danger to the viewer oh I think what you carry into the learning process for remote viewing may be a danger to you but that dangerous\nThere all along anyway I'd ... I'd like to add something to that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and a poll of both said I've never had a bad experience and remote going\nBut I Would like to underscore the fact that uh this is a very interesting uh experience remote doing or being psychic and there are a lot of people that\nAre that are on the edge to start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their construct or it can be very undermining or damaging to the psyche\nAnd uh there is evidence that a lot of people do sort of step off the edge and lose touch with reality in other words they become a pretty much in in a involved there\nAre caught up in the the irrationality of it or the uh they lose their stability or their ability to deal a skeptically with the material and what's going on\nMajor a project or would you all agree\nOr do I I I Would agree except that I haven't seen any evidence that the Chinese are in fact so it's sort of a moot question and I'm not sure how anyone would would evaluate the results of the\n[noise] you know there have been there have been a lot of reports about Soviet having been involved in that in the past um but it's mostly kind of rumors and and and such a again no evidence of course the thing of this nature it'd be hard to prove any way\nBut there were some interest in what wild stories about what the Soviets could or might be doing\nIt all up there are All right gentlemen hold tight we'll be right back to you\nGathering of eagles I'm calling in Linda be counted Joe\n... and Paul Smith all involved in projects\nStargate for the U.S government which ran for Twenty years using your tax dollars\nTo remote view [noise]\nWho are listening to our bill somewhere inside there might be drink goes to goes wrong march twenty Nineteen nineties\n[noise] [noise] ... folks just robbing the furniture\nIn Lumberton what what happened [laughter]\n\nOkay let's try that again I focus is Rodney furnish it in Lumberton come check out our awesome furniture that process is just can't be beat we have a crazy blowout sales going on now for more information see our website at first\n... dot com oh she sang it\n\nLike the opposite Brett Kavanaugh officially sworn in as associates Supreme Court justice\nKavanaugh's nomination was put in doubt after accusations of sexual misconduct Kavanaugh denied them Republicans concluded there was no corroborating evidence minority leader Chuck Schumer just confirmation is a low point\nFor the Senate\nOr the court as a country\nFox's jarred helping Kavanaugh confirmed by a margin of fifty to forty eight sworn in by former Justice Anthony Kennedy and chief justice John Roberts meanwhile the president in Topeka, Kansas stumping for Republican congressional candidate Steve Watkins\nMan\nAnd a proud West Point graduate that\nTrump will also praised the cabin or a nomination claiming the Senate Judiciary committee members had become an angry left wing mob Fox News [noise]\nBuddy knowing\nA news story five sixty Kaomi ah broadcasting from American standard ... dot com studios [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nFree mirror networks reserve hartsville somewhere in time tonight three three goes to goes from ... million the nineties the\nGood morning everybody leaning you've gotten show mix\nSmith all in the government\nProject Stargate [noise] farm I guess [noise] what do you hear what's coming up [noise]\n... rules for alerts and offers me automatic tax message Mr dean originally apply\nHello America this is Martha Stewart now you can cook great tasting dinners at home and it's easy to forget about frozen foods and take out instead join me for great home cooked food introducing Martha and released the meal kittens repression fresh ingredients with my wonderful easy to follow recipes delivered right to your door\nAnd right now you can try street for free for a very limited time I'm offering three free market and more at least two meals to everyone\nAnywhere imagine cooking butter ... state Berkshire pork tenderloin key stuffed chicken and more with new recipes every week Martha Ann Marie ... doing helps you put a delicious dinner on your table in around thirty minutes\nFor three free meals and free shipping text yum to two four six eight ten just kept the word yum did two four six eight ten for details hurry three free won't last long taxed yum to two four six eight ten\nMessages ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

gentleman a I have a ... year from Ed Dame secretary that says the following and I would like you to react to it art\nWith respect to treason remember that generals double bind the commander of ins calm whatever that is was chairman of the board of side check when it went public in Nineteen eighty nine\nOr would that would that affect anybody's comment with regard to the release of a classified material and\nUh I Would ask if it is a exonerate at times oh I mean does this mean that he didn't do what he did\nThat this is Joe I'm ... one of the one of the normal procedures for for\nFinding something else is to um to claim that uh someone else's already told you and then it's just a mess\nBut all of the information we're getting it from someone else I'm this is a a pretty common ploy and it's used by the media representatives many times in newspaper articles and things of that nature\nBecause someone else said it doesn't make a true and it certainly is no valid reason for violating a a video that an officer makes or the security that someone is committed to in ... case um\nI Would rather not comment directly on him [noise] but\nUh I I don't see it as a valid reason for what he may or may not have done yeah I I'd like\nTo kind of when a little bit on its defense here um\nI think treasonous too strong a term here a treason implies that you're providing um damaging information to unknown enemy or had didn't do that um he was\nYou know in the various ah Venus and when she released whatever information he did um\nHe was in perhaps you know I don't know what his motivation was but he he didn't intend for that information necessarily to be used by an enemy or or or or someone who wish to harm the United states you know of course by releasing it publicly you lose control of that information\nWell do you help people like this are Lynn a yes now one of the problems that I have\nIs this a security clearance and ah [noise] for many other reasons as well or if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen\nI Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh\nUh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to so and so yes I'm I Will tell them partially because I Want the cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity\nThat oh if they will get the investigating officer to contact me I Will be glad to work the problem for free\nAlright ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case you can't have your son contact him\nThere aren't there you know and it's been ... years ...\nYes but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now we worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years and uh and on the results of our ah\nOur session a Mel Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding\nAre I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can\nI get a hold of lean\nOkay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nUh do you have Internet access or I Would presume if she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh\nI Would say the easiest the easiest a address to remember is art bell dot com and uh right there's a link to my page and on the pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with the computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time we are heavily backed up with a signed witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so um\nOh I Hope people won't be offended if um\nYou know if they call and uh have their police department call as well and uh nothing is done that day ah we have a we have a tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable uh west of the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nAri yes\nGood morning I'm I cried for you and I tried to follow the law to cover up a cigarette or a fat\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nAre absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much a does a session on a target and they're wrong out of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm a\nTask the same exact question to two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to end deems a tapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes there'll be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat's my fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote via correctly\nThe more who learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn encourage excuse me incorrectly\nAnd uh dishes my big fear with many of the quickie courses that are out there oh I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder lake effect just a you know the hundred McKee if there sure are just a\nAlmost destroyed any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah what what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released did a very or relatively comparatively inexpensive prices\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen more coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a one of the sun has to be up

firsthand research into all the different phenomena ... and\nThis is cool he's been all over I don't know how he's getting to do this because\nThere's not a lot of money in studying this for sure so he's done well we'll have to ask them about that but he's been in sixteen countries four continents\nA study in this kind of stuff psychics goes on and houses ... miracles ... that you know and that's one by the way a lot of people don't talk about this miracles but also Bigfoot lake monsters and you know Loch Ness things like that UFOs reincarnation crop circles all sorts of goodies\nAnd he is

the planet I mean you've been everywhere this this is this is good\nWell there there's a it's a good question actually point out there is a novel and money\nAnd [laughter] right [laughter] and grow by some sort of X. files [laughter] department but I'm not [laughter] ugly you\nKnow I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo [noise]\nUm and for them mind or of a magazine can require new things like that but I Am even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folk or point of view\nAnd so one party the answer question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that at all then look\nAnd it goes again All right [laughter] they're like what can we weren't going to go

[noise]\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with been Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of\nHalloween it really does have a um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nThe story and and honestly cause I follow these things every Halloween about those and of course the scary clown scary ... crime panics 'cause I\nI'm suddenly the guy that talks about that but a lot of times ah there you know there there's a lot of them just hoaxes I remember there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago and he went to the the um [noise] the police saying that the ...\nThe he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you\nExactly exactly I was just such\nAn offensive like first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all\nAnd you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Want to have her but\nI wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray or candy I mean really\nDo you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dance often\nAre actually the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost all you know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you know yeah [laughter] I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing it's just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so they can feel the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people to mommy for soles of of of you know purgatory this you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it\nPrimarily for money [laughter] 'cause it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily a strict with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second waves of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nI'm ... and in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years I'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff he you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask\nSo your people were having to be creative you know point though her right\nYou'd actually yeah families coming together to make a gift costume ...\nAnd what you find is that the first um the in the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as an ornate and your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this was when you start getting adults who are you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have\nA you know you have the princess is right you have Cinderella you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well on us and the question you know I think that um you know ... ...\nThe Halloween as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken too far or in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's\nIt's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy\nOr you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty you're fifty years\nOr you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a ghost you know where you've\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that you got to six he had that he was like this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about this he can and part of it when we come back stay with it you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and ... and I\nNever missed a detail issue or just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com\nOr selling what's new down the free I our radio\nThe decorating the house or just sitting here in our mind you and your bags with labor in mind when you're\nPlaying break out all our great deal more deeply whether you're at home or the stadium knew why our Radio Free wheeling collecting them out and now\nWe live\nA rock and roll over the last year\nWe've got a great feeling ... to ... in the house\nDavid your guy that has overcome a severe issue or whether\nLight the light bulb went on and I started to research on the same reasons why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better I can only tell you one thing\nThe product war and not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy it gives me right charity\nCare or health system better way carnivores bills everything back into my body just taken a while but you know ...

coast on news talk five sixty kale vi\n[noise]\nCounty Willis here on the coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGhost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in from you know mall haunted houses you know reached out and grabbed her crew somebody or whatever I mean it's the only thing that some of that but\nBut you know that for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean a a mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if you drink when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was before I went festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA season and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to Eighteen\nYou know though shocked not separate which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of a more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a week you're bored or strictly prohibited anyone using ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nConcerned that using a word you board was going to open up\nYou know ... or whatever I I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is\nUh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing\nFor Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was that a kid the dresses up as a witch or goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\nParents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party\nSo if they the the the remake\nThe case to distinguish it from home and this is not always as a harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll though you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and uh uh we were um and I grew up\nIn Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest events like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and then the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when\nIt came to Christmas [laughter] just the way it was right down the\nMarathon borrowed mine either right away I Am doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the real or on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here [laughter]\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup\nNever ... all the producers were were watching that so uh hey you guys are going on there now are\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future in the same town of part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around all ... sorts of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at it it's ... pm I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claim they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are eat investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know due to sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the cameras on we're going to walk around here and all sorts of things\nAnd and and that that's part part part of the problem here is that if it if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample location so for example you'll see a ghost undergoing a location maybe there's team of them and do you know they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else would go home and analyzed them\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal abnormal you need to know what's normal and you know whatever reading as you get\nYour walking around with the M.

V. I. T.\nV. on explainable coast to coast on news talk five sixty Kaomi I [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nThen that means that by definition their their material because you know sound is audio waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded um on on your audio taping and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we we all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know the recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... electric field detectors and the problem is that there's no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut ... but no one has ever proved the you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person you're a who tried to do some stuff with something called the God helmet\nA and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nUh and goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time saying I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it well\nYou know I'm I don't know it goes or I mean that's that's you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the grossed hundreds and believers are across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on and\nThen you know with some murder murder of tragedy that was recorded in stone and ... the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beams other people say that they're you know the ... that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for ghost research right because goes can't be both inner dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder\nYou know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena of it has such a widely disparate range of explanations that is a problem so I\nI don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spears of the dead that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nFor windows for Willis ... thank you for hitting the information\nYou had in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can get a cue my dad coming up so we're going to be talking the where will in London so you'll want to stick around in Jamin hall Sinclair he somebody you want to me out in the case in time definitely thank you yeah
