[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back with Robert Zubrin from the bar society as we talk about space we'll take calls with Robert next hour Robert de you know ... don't you what kind of a guy is\nWell um [noise] what can I say he's an unusual guy um do you watch him he ah yeah although we\nCan be a difficult at times ah [noise] I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is\nUm [noise]\nUh okay look um\nThe thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he is very driven it's very hard working uh uh and he is\nA driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages\nHe likes money he likes cool things you can buy with money but\nThat's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for\nBut you know um that's like going to a foreign country and finding no buildings there just a couple of other people wandering around and said hey did you just get off this plane\nUm and they say no we've been here forever and you say well where's your houses they said well uh I don't know I'm ... then you might suspect that they're they're pulling one on you and they also\n... the same time you did [noise]\nBut you see what I'm saying so so this scientific argument against going to Mars is absurd and ... and and this idea that we'll know more about Mars by not going is just crazy uh because I mean what planet we know the most about\nWhatever happened to the plan's your plans to tour for Mars and to try to develop an atmosphere\n[noise] well uh terra forming Mars is something that is is going to have to be done in the future it it it's not something that a frankly our generation is going to do it\nAnd it could take what are you are a hundred years to complete\nNo it will take longer than that although I'm basically here's how it goes first we're in our time we can send human explores tomorrow we can set up the first basis on Mars and I'm hoping to be alive when the first child was born on Mars okay that's what I'd like to see the first\nOh what a birth certificate that would be yeah\nThere you go right okay so the first child born on Mars that is when we're really they're okay but\nAfter that\nWe're going to have to grow on you know settlements towns cities on Mars create industry is on Mars once they're done which might be a hundred years from now [noise]\nUm once you have a strong industrial civilization on Mars they can actually address the question of trying to change the climate of Mars and change the environment\nBecause first thing you got to do with Mars is you want to warm up\nAnd we know how to warn planted some proven that right now on earth and if we wanted to do it on purpose we could do it a lot more effectively\nAnd uh the way to do it is to reduce greenhouse gases um that is that tramp the sun's heat a they're a seal too of course is a greenhouse gas but we know how to make gases that are much more powerful greenhouse gases and C. O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and the so called a a floor carpet and cast says we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in ...\nMachines instead we just released them to the atmosphere and we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed orange that much that warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been sponge to and it would outcast and they would thicken the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas and\nThat would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those places there is a North American\nOceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\nBut yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Marshall struck to flow the lakes and seas which struck to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you could start spreading plants around now\nIf we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be brief ...\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country\nBut the Martians are\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those are USS and they bring us back\nA while most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia both facing a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy [noise]\nUm but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing [noise] um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes to um dot com\n\n\n\nThis is we're ministry that brings redeeming love of Chrysler hurting children what we know that many kids love animals\nAnd when they encounter an animal that helps break to emotional memories of abuse and neglect sit and there's all kinds of hopeless been doing this for about six years now and we've been able to introduce kids everything from Wall of these\nPythons hands meaning tortoises to providers and is a nonprofit that we sent him to do this help the many children suffer in our area and beyond\nAnd one of the great things about it is to give children matter of fact we are a little girl teams were alone which has proven three years ago she shared with a\n...

I'm a strong in space which by the way is a a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nMuch right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know I'm not a reason is a ... in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was in the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that a ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the\nUm [noise] you know I'm all us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people\nBy having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um\nYou know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go\nAnd um\nYou know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure will um now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds uh they launch vehicles could\nBecome much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel if you can get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a ... you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah\nYou know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space\nTravel [noise] um [noise] well um we could\nI mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get

and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America do like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK well there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right well here's the thing um [noise] there there\nIs an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars\nThere are new Indians there are no\nBuys in hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks um nobody be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little a futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people\nTo state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions uh being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because\nOf mining claim even if you can't mine it today\nIf if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value and uh and and and\nThe exchange for those claims to people could get a exploration missions finance mine\nThe asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable [noise] and um once our space capabilities advanced a bit more ah that will become a

L. vi [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast George ... with you and our guest Brandon ... with us Brandon is a political therapist author Paris psychologist residing in the northeastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo psychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland was research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on E. and maps environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot at a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it actually I actually got a job and then I studied psychology and goes partner thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that\n[laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight went to the apple was for a year in the at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teamed up their sports wise\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book but to give us an overview of what you've been doing Brant\n[noise] well um [noise] you know I have a degree in psychology at University of Edinburgh I studied um basically environmental sensitivity and go counter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the critical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going in and I'm interested in writing a book and that's when I came out with the go study\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia explain these things away nation after nation over active imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying and counter kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows provide insight into these life altering experience [noise]\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself\nIf we were looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life ghostly encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters um it's the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you\nKnow and you know these ghosts have been picking our interests for millions of years and it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these new theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters with a book\nWell then you bring a do some real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a physicist a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so\nThere's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article what kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't have you concluded to brag about what the grossly experience might be a real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a majority of the ghostly encounters that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever\nBut I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them one of the\nI think there's I'm In my in my view I take them more by ... view on goes so that's um inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things I I really think that\nA lot of goes link counters that happen out there um the base of it has\nTo do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book over um\nWhat I call a a tele path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and ghostly encounters a so I really think that um people's telepathy a is a real or it was a real important part of it goes to counter\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um\nI I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters\nBut I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a\nDeath or life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it's sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that\nOne of those things is um you know emotional\nDistress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens\nThink that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send a distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday\nNight and I look to the left and there's a an operation of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know\nMy aunt passed away right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll saying to me\nAnd I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter]\nI there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and\nUm what environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nYour five sixty kill me I miss southeast Texas the home of goes to goes

start to shop so shall I put out come from I think you said I never get out yourself\nWormholes portal actions um\nAnd and that sort of under special conditions I'll call them goes enter into our universe I'm so in this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous timer dimension universe and she was able to look back and see what's happening that location and maybe the child and the mom\nSaw this woman dressed and futuristic ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else and a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and I'm a one morning of\nMe and my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way too normally she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah\nWell you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know and I'm like you know when I'm going to go ahead and\nGoing to follow through with this so I open the door the dog went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and and somehow\nUm you know drowned in there by\nYou know it's dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling of that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there is some sort of like distress signals sent to me with the cat and distress and that kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences gr Brendan because the person who\nDied comes back\nNever had some unfinished business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know a percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ... psychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you\nMight use unconventional means you know and if you have collective unconscious and there are collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are ... stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm In a better place\nYou know and and I think these things I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these\nUm bereavement operations associated with their debt spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge no yeah yeah and and\nPerhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way the\nProcess emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of a survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased couldn't help let's move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of moved towards resolution and ... and when I talk to this these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one step after these operations\nAnd I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um that can come out of it goes the encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like that\nAnd what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys ... what's so special about\n[noise] uh that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think you know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em\nThere's there's some test out their specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nThat like human magnet you yeah yeah exactly you know I the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that saying that this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental designs that um you know where they're actually doing that from El FM our eyes and eat jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more sense that other people and the general population can't you know so and this is true for less than we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really\nThat doesn't hurt at all say with those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back law should take phone calls getting another couple of stories of some of your studies when we come back\nTo ... two nights just log on to ...\n... club or a football club Sheffield\nThat the founded in England [noise]\nThis weekend Nineteen Twenty one the Green Bay Packers play their first

scientific work the ghost studies what are your colleagues say about your work Brendan if anything\n[noise] um [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you um wrote a book about ghosts and are interested in love with the inside most people will tell me a story [laughter]\nAnd they've all got one don't think\nThey do and I was really shocked that you know 'cause you're kind of sit back and kind of weight when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive you\nKnow there's a there's still some colleagues who come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they you know follow it up with but you can't do any water or anything like that\nBut the response has been pretty positive I'm you know if it's something that's really fascinating and it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing for humans since you know the dawn of time you know does this go stuff sure I'm\nSo ... you know it's not that bizarre or out of context\nAnd listen I mean parents college he is a subset of psychology at the legitimate discipline\nJust like social psychology and er oh psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university they are the ones to clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair of psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is\nFor those of us in the field it's\nKnow that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWhat's out there that has baffled you show for Brandon that you don't have the answers you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nHold your guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho cases where objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know the do humans have the ability to move objects\nIf they're um in distress um\nYou know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like for the older guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it's it's something I always read about that go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new goals seemed to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMr Bush or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning soft glowing light appeared next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me\nWhat was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child dating my accent died the night before unexpectedly\nDeath occurred around the same time I saw the image of my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time so this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about earlier\nSo we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of a lot but the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional shifts related to the process of dying in a in a way set up\nHello Patrick distress message to his ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glowing light operation a those types of things um and what's really fascinating is\nSince his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up with the er ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of a in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they're linked with in this case you know the wife\nMay know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well but this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but also bags that question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the time to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do with this as well\nOh yeah yeah I it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal um or goes for encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think the electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well\nAn animal sure does you know any involvement of\nHumans also includes the involvement of electricity because like just that he is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nI've heard of people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal ghosts\nRations made its debut on the U.S single charge
