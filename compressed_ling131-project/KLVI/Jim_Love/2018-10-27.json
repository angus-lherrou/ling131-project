David welcome to Texas outdoor news or how you doing this morning\nI'm doing pretty good how 'bout yourself doing well doing confused David her Daniel I'm Sorry I said David I'm Daniel Daniel ahah yes\nDon't hold that against us do hold it against this heroin me ask you this so I I went to my usual brilliant questions but technical guidance biologist what is your job\nBasically give assistant landowners on a ... cat management and managing a lot of times they're against the seat but we do a lot of other things as well but that's a big portion of our job\nYou know coming out of last hunting season we were on the heels of Hurricane Harvey um yes you're on your survey did you see much of a um declining hunter participation and and the decline in um harmless because of hunters are taking care of other primary homes\nOr early ... it really impacted that does season especially they they seem to get back down here later in the seats and they still came down to the high after they got everything in their personal lives squared away get up so they didn't get some hardest on that but yes in fact the harvest straight somewhat\n... worth of weather that we him because it wasn't widespread in South Texas um what kind of a story did we have on Adler growing seasons in the spring what kind of a conditions that we have\nWhere most of south Texas or had created rainfall or at least decent rainfall in January to set aside for the spring and then the spring was dry okay and so uh it was pretty spotty throughout most of south Texas in the spring\nIt got worse and and the western portion of south Texas throughout the summer they weren't extreme drought if you drew a line probably from ... nine down highly sixteen a step west of that was pretty dry the spring and summer\nIt to the aid to that in the summertime we kinda got some rains in June and so the eastern portion hurt a little bit better as far as available moisture in the summertime [noise] but uh most of south Texas in spring it was pretty spotty rainfall did not have as a stellar spring\nYeah Daniel a initially the age old question okay 'cause I've got a place up in the hill country and I have certainly I I and I have hunted down in South Texas but I go okay hill country let me see and I got you know I got oaks and I got the ... and I got grass and like all this stuff and I go down to south Texas and I go [noise]\nHow do they get bigger 'cause I don't know what they eat you know if you look at the heck is it heartier maker heartier because of that or what\nThe one good thing about south Texas is a viable brush that\nGenerally airport for Forbes whenever they can get them south Texas is a semi arid environment which means sports are highly dependent on rain all we don't always get the rain down here\nBut we did have a lot of brush and so a lot of the available brush as we're getting nutrition and also you know it it's good habitat down here not just nutrition but recovered space and everything else as well so we did have a lot of the first brush bases okay and that really\nHelps your population out especially when it gets dry when it gets dry ship purport to browse and that helps carry them through a drought uh in addition we have a lot of ... which creates a lot of beans during a drought and that can really curious do it you're out as well and and again this year really helped us out\nBeing crop with the rains that were handed a boy did we had we had\nAn onset of um ... of all Forbes or that have been coming up\nOh yes sir all of south Texas is looking great right now\nI'm for scraps of animal her patients cover ... it's an excellent shape so uh what is going to happen it's just going to make life difficult for hunters because we're not going to count that corner very well you're not no record here\nBut in the ears terms and also quail in Turkey and in every other games the the the habitat is in great shape\nAll right well I saw um a a report on ... that um\nUh Robert Perot's was saying that uh some of these birds are maybe trying to pull off of lake hatchery all getting any ah like reports on them\nYes sir Yes sir I Am a and again mainly I Would say to the age of sixteen on the eastern side of south Texas I'm Still here and reports a little bumble bee still baby quail are being born it's late\nOr now this late they're not going to have a a production here are generally that happens from you know we get rain April June that's their highest productivity time but they're still going to try and we're sending a ... on the eastern side of this as a of a south Texas\nHere we usually um a lot of people wait on quail hunting until after ... and so by the time ... late January and in the month of February to the end of the ... those birds ought to be up to ... but also don't ... hunters don't need to put the pressure when we've not had a good I'm good hatch right\nYes or in and Quil hunter's kind of self regulate it there's not a lot of quail out there they generally don't how much or late they take a lot fewer birds\nHere let me go back maybe\nNot a problem on over harvesting a quail or you know they can over artist at that if a few people ate at heart but state wide it's generally not a problem\nHere before we run out of time and go back to 'em around June when the phones are being dropped what kind of on the recruitment and survival did we see is you were saying we were kind of dry in the summer period\nYes or a on the western side of south Texas a it was\nIt was better than I expected a given the rank all we had it's still going to be a ... to an average ...\nAh and then on the eastern side I Would say it's about average no doubt so not not too terribly bad considering the dry conditions the one difference we think it nearly as hot as previous droughts we had so I think the fall it's fair to a little bit better\nCut you one of the ground as the bird we've gotten south Texas a about turkey what kind of hedged we see a have a decent pulled recruitment\nA turkey production all is I Would say corn this year across south Texas or however we were going to have a lot of Turkey's the hot because we've had several cricket shares a get production so there's a lot of adult bird out there so I Would encourage everybody to get out there in hot and what they share production I just was not that good\nAnd then get flooded like this in the fall I mean it's a perfect set up for that but [noise] we got so much crop land around they don't wear strict themselves to the demand apply as go they'll go out and pick up something that residual Carmen sorghum and\nA lot of grain fails around\nWith the moisture that we've received recently and hopefully a more ... way over the next few weeks and months\nUm is this going to have enough of a positive impact and put ground or moisture into the ground a to set the stage wars are heading into a twenty Nineteen or the springtime or is it are we still too far out from it\nNow I Believe is really important uh [noise] this is this fall moisture that we're getting now uh\nWe we we we don't want to have another drought and in spring but uh if we just have an average\nRainfall year next year this there's big time march or we're getting right here in the fall that was a wonderful thing getting set up for the springtime we just need average rainfall come in spring and I think will have a pretty good bounce back on brown nesting birds are quite oh pheasants and\nOf course a good start for the Atlanta development on deer\nStanding by and we appreciate your

just having a direct conversation with the health care professional on line or a sky ping to some degree where their face to face with the health care professionals or somewhere\nAnd some of these services are provided by their insurance companies sometimes it's just a an\nApp service that uh is provided um from what most\nPatients to tell me it's a pretty neat as fast as quick and every bodies happy typically what the service and you know we're going to see an expansion of this sort of an application and you know I obviously I don't I don't have a problem with it um\nYou know it's certainly going to fill the void and fill a gap of healthcare healthcare need healthcare service or doctors um have struggled you know the years as unfortunately more\nAmericans are having are developing more medical problems and need more kind of medical guidance ah they're more services out there to help guide\nA certain sorts of decisions certain sorts of a\nHealth care on you know this is one sort of application just a doctor morning show and just helping people figure out what to do and and if they feel bad what\nThey be concerned about again because you know we go to school we learned about these diseases and we get a better insight\nAbout if you have a physical symptoms had something to worry about it as something not whereabouts do you need immediate medical care of again this does a lot of times require I'm just seeing a disease over and over again to develop that sense of urgency or not urgency so\nThese sorts of medical outlets that you are seeing popping up I think these are these are good things of four\nThe American public just because it can get very confusing more medications you take them on medical problems you have\nIf you're running back and forth to sing most of the doctors and\nIs that the connection between the doctors and what they're doing what they're saying might seem a little blurry\nUm again all this technical jargon to all these tests you know what does it mean and I still a marvel uh honestly at that or even in my own experience interacting with especially patience and hospital [noise]\nYou know and you get sick and you're not really thinking clearly you don't remember very well and um I've always felt that it's a good idea to have someone there with you when you are sick you go to the ER and get it minutes at a hospital you know it's there just to have someone they're friends family why fuss when that sort of thing because you know when you get sick and just\nReally don't care to to listen sometimes a lot of the stuff that you just sick and you feel bad and just want to get better\nAnd communication a lotta times based on my experience in just falters no it's no one's fault but again a lot of stuff is going on you're talking to a lot of different people by the time you get to the ER or even if you call it the MS she called the mess\nAnd then you get into the ER and then\nYou know those are already two sets of health care professionals that you've been talking to then you get to the floor\nAnd you know depending on how the doctor that is taking care of you organizes his day there might be other doctors covering for that doctor and then you bring in some consultants and then we can hits and then those consultants have doctors that cover for them\nAnd you know it just the confusion and the the the how your medical care is orchestrated can get kind of complex and you know that's just in hospitals even\nOn an outpatient basis you're um you know go on to your health your primary care physician health care professional\nAnd you might be going through a couple of consultants and those consultants again might have doctors covering for them they might have a mid level a health care professionals nurse practitioners physician assistants are depending on how to orchestrate in an office you might see different health care professionals each time you go\nAnd again you know results of tests and what does it mean and where you're going so it can get very complicated very rapidly and so these sorts of a tele medicine applications that are now available I think they're wonderful again I just talked about all the people talking to you\nKnow the thing about uh sometimes in the hospital even in the office you know there's there's time compression of time you know this is so much time that the health care professional has with you and he's got to squeeze in er here she has to squeeze and [noise]\nYou know all of this information and ah you know I've found that uh you know certain consults into a much better job even health care professionals\nI'm Sorry primary care physicians again have a lot of time constraints as well so sometimes the message doesn't get across and you know when you're at home on the weekend and there's just it's more relaxed\nNow you have more time to talk and have a loan linked to your conversation or to try and figure out what is going on because it is important\nIn my experience for patients to advocate for themselves and make sure they understand you know why things are happening with medicines and walk on this medicines cannot stop 'em do I have to continue them\nYou know what are the results of all my tests you know we really collectively honestly speaking with you collectively as a medical\nCommunity trying to improve all those different facets of healthcare delivery but it is sometimes very difficult to do that on every single patient every single day\nAnd so these are ... applications have come into play again as another layer of assistance for you so that you understand everything that's going on\nUm you know or even being asked now to hand out more medical information when you come to the doctor's office or you know when I started out as a doctor\nI'm you know we didn't have anything to the patient patient came to the office and we gave him all these things to do and change and\nThey were supposed to remember and ah they left and you know we put it in our yard but we didn't share that with a patient and they went home they're supposed to remember all that stuff and we you know we realized that\nCertainly when you talk about making two or three changes\nEvery single time he go to the doctor's office this just the way the human mind works and again when you're sick you're confused [noise]\nYour memory and your ability to comprehend all that is going to be impacted and just you just don't remember everything that's obviously going to impact the disease management and your compliance\nI in terms of what we recommend it to you and then obviously can impact how the disease progressed as our it's controlled\nAnd so with the uh use of electronic medical records now we're doing a much better job sharing a lot of that information with the patient so that can take it home review it look at it or make sure everything is right and all you know that\nThat one single maneuver just helps improve the village of the patient to\nFollow along with this and keep up with this because again once you have a few medicines on your profile and a few diseases that we're following\nIt gets very complicated very confusing about what to do and what not to do especially medicines kind of cell in the same are ... you know we we started getting very precise with the way we want you to take it well you know with this medicine which has taken in the morning\nAnd then this one wants to date at noon and then the other one wants to take twice a day but this other one wants to take three times a day but when you take this other one three times a day don't take this one of the same day maybe trade it out for another pill next week [laughter] just\nUp and down and starting and stopping\nYou know it gets it gets terrible and you know I'm just\nSurprised that we're able to even accomplish\nAnything without all that information and so every year or so um the insurance companies who pay the bills basically are asking and recommending health care professionals to\nHand more information to you at the time of the visit 'em in particular the diseases that you have it again with our electronic medical records\nAre there is a patient portal that you know you just get some\nUm passwords pass code and you can access the patient portal and on that portal there's all these opportunities for education or your disease\nAnd so that you can again educate yourself advocate for yourself alone with this again with all these time constraints sometimes the the health care profession doesn't have time to fully explain everything to you and so at your leisure at your convenience you at home and you can\nGo to these Web sites you can read about blood pressure read about diabetes read about the medications because again we're being asked to hand out this information to you\nSo that you can educate stuff about the medicine that you're taking you know the potential side effects why it's being used again just to improve\nYour understanding your clarity about everything that we're trying to do so that you're not in the dark and I've just found that patients who are up to speed with their disease and why we're doing things they typically have a much better outcome they um are happier\nUm you're going to be a person is is going to be harder to get you better and it's going to take long to get you better especially if you wait three or four days for that infection that kind of get on top of you\nAnd so you want to act sooner rather than later and so a lot of times there's just kind of these obstacles to seek medical care maybe don't have transportation nobody there to take you\nUm time constraints ... a lot of people just kind of put it off and put it off put it off I'll Wait until Monday I wait until Tuesday\nAnd I guess I'm trying to say is based in my experience to do not weight you have a headache you have any physical symptoms you concerned about\nGo get it checked out now I mean all the stories that we hear about people being diagnosed with these life threatening illness sees would just kind of these flimsy physical symptoms that kind of just kept going and going\nThe way it is now there's just too many outlets\nToo many ways to get medical care is is that the traditional situation well let me go into the office let me have my doctor see me I mean those are long gone it's just more opportunity for you to seek medical care and you need to engage into that [noise] a rice what's up [noise]\nThis is your listener and Ballard Texas we talk on God\nThank you how you doing today I'm doing a wonderful go else [laughter] I don't I don't I don't have the almost a hopeless car\nThat's still outweigh you know what I'm saying [laughter] I never you get this current or former ah yeah\nYeah I Know but I kind of how it is so bad but whatever I can do from a ... you know I'm here for you know what I'm saying [laughter]\nI've been having asked me to act for tenure haven't done anything about it I just wanted to comment out of your\nWell just like I was saying you know as we get older ah our body you know obviously changes and the heart is kind of ...\nSo to that and you know we do ultrasounds in the heart\nFor patients who have blood pressure diabetes and um and doing those we can kind of document the progression of kind of heart dysfunction\nYou know the ... started to get a little sick the chamber's can get in large um the heart can become stiff so just kind of age related issues especially if you have high blood pressure diabetes so\nElectrical system is separate from the circulation\nBut it's one of those aspects of heart disease as we get older that tends to become a problem and so you're talking about skipped heartbeat extra heartbeat irregular heartbeat these are all sort of the things that come up we talk about April ... and all the time 'cause that's one of the most common\nElectrical abnormalities in our country and sometimes\nThe ... ... Haitians um are these little runs of your heart running fast can be the symptom of a tribulation are can be the symptom of something a little bit more sinister so\n[noise] you know our advice that you go in sometime next week Monday Tuesday to your health care profession even today and go get an e cagey at least to go get some blood work at least\nI had an ... two weeks ago everything was OK okay and my annual physical\nOkay wonderful and uh did you discuss this with your health care professional hey I'm having some palpitations except show you don't\nHave the same doctor for ten years okay so you're already a family physician is not a cardiologist\nOkay so you've already had it evaluated and worked up\nYeah and I took my call three times a day to try to control it but I still have the attacks but I'd just gotten used to\nWell the thing about that is again depending on life should be have your healthcare professional um you know it's just so many medicines out there now to help manage a lot of these electrical problems\nAnd I guess from my position you shouldn't be having episodes um at least that's my understanding of these are sort of things I'm such that if you continue to have episodes which is not good for your heart\nOr you know I Would recommend you know talking with the health care professional may be getting just a second opinion from heart doctor [noise] um just to make sure that there's nothing else going on\nToo by the way it and who you are beginning\nYeah absolutely I mean again as you get older more electrical abnormalities tend to occur and\nI guess my understanding of the heart electrical system the medicines that out there that we want to make sure that nothing is happening to you that's abnormal and to see if there's anything\nMedication wise that might help you you know we've uh mentioned is a cardiac ... therapy that's now out there for these electrical ... again primarily for age of ... [noise]\nUm but uh we wanted to a point where you're not having any symptoms at all and so this is too many ... out there to try to try and control this so I Would would probably if you\nCame to me and said hey I'm Still having these problems\nYou know I I might try some medicines on you because again a most health care professionals we understand all this stuff and we can try some ads but if it doesn't work then our typically pick it up to those doctors because they do it more frequently than I Do\nAnd they have a typically deeper understanding of all that 'cause they just do it more often fried and they they trained and so hey I mean if you have access\nTo those consultants hey wants to go see the heart of having to take a look at you and make sure everything's okay um they might not change anything but I think everyone sleeps better\nUnder those circumstances again because medicine is tricky um you can never be through careful [noise]\nUm and you want to be you know aggressive is possible especially when patients continue\nTo have symptoms that's not getting better despite what you're doing for them you want to make sure you've covered all your base is and if you have still having problems need to kick it up to another doctor let them get a fresh approach a different pros let them do their evaluations just to make sure\nThat everything is being done because again as you get older I've told listeners before those kind of a you know the aging process basically increases are opportunity\nFor something bad to happen you know it's just it's programmed into us and I'm so anytime you start having physical symptoms that continue\nWhen I go to the nth degree to make sure you had the proper work up you've tried all the medicines you've seen all the right doctors um\nAgain just to be on the safe side [noise]\nAren't appreciate your opinion and I enjoyed listening to your show and the next time you're on the rise campus to be sure notice our new opera house we're building but at the stadium opera\nHouse it's huge yeah that's what I that's what I Love about right always growing [laughter]\nAnyway and it's hard not to the shepherd school of music and I are huge man it was a building that won't be for another two years\nI'll check it out I'm In Houston just about every other week so I'll go check it out All right All right ... thanks for your ... my uh my\nPleasure take care and anytime you have one of these physical symptoms you know go get that thing checked out hey Darren what's up\nDarwin Darwin\nFrom orange oh sorry Darwin Yasser what's up man\nAh I'd call you back in January I had a situation where I had a triglycerides that were very high a it was I think for twenty six and I had talked to you about this apple cider vinegar [noise]\nSo anyway I just bringing this up is that I did go back in August\nAnd have everything dated my blood work and this problem it lowered my triglycerides from for twenty six to one sixty or a lot\nA and there's only one thing I'd like to mention a bath is is that when you drink it is it's best to drink it through a straw that cause a ... this is a very acidic and from what I understand it's a very harmful to your teeth\nSo your drink it through a straw poll and it'd be a lot better and then of course you need to brush your teeth but I'm just bringing that out but I just saw the walk a little testimony concerning this apple cider vinegar because\nI did read up on it and it apparently it is a very valuable product in and really uh it is really I Am Seventy years old but I feel very healthy and I'm very blessed\nBut I think that this is one of the things that people need to consider if they do have you know bad in the bloodstream\nYeah I mean I think we've talked about those certain over the counter maneuvers that you can try 'em right now apple cider vinegar is very popular and\nUm if patients ask me about it I I don't have any reservations is not like in promoting it but if they want to try it then I don't have any problems with that and there's a lot of people believe in it and I'm all for that\nYou know whatever makes you feel healthier and better then I'm also I'm all for it and so I haven't heard of the thing about the straw\nA and you know I Would obviously\nBe concerned if something is that costs stick to your teeth and your\nYour mouth I mean ... man is since odd that it's good for you but I guess no pain no gain when it comes to that but um yeah I mean congratulations you know you found something that works for you yeah keeping your triglycerides down so I'm all for that however I always\nOr you might have more than others are less than others I Do know and I try to encourage\nUm our our\nTalk about this all the time if you are overweight\nAnd pay 'em ... you're going to have more chronic tension and load on your lower back and so that's going to accelerate this process what we called degenerative joint disease\nAgain which what happens is the the soft tissue like the ligaments the tendons the um the disks in between the bones um these things will start to shift and change and all sorts of different\nPlays again to contribute\nTo what we call ... ... which is another medical term that just means narrowing\nUm you know the the nervous system kind of circulates or tunnels through your bones system kind of like the electrical system of a house and when this degenerative process starts kicking up\nIt's almost like your house than eating termites and things are shifting or your foundation is falling and things are shifting and so it starts to put tension\nAnd pressure on those nerves and so you know your your life to go out or the phone system will go out or\nA you have a you know things just start happening electrically there in the house so it's no different with your body you started having pain\nTightness a nun this burning tingling just you know and your butt down the you're the back of your leg the ... the the uh outside party leg down to your calf your Toyota foot\nAnd do stuff can be very very severe miserable I'm as there's nothing like nerve pain I mean it is one of the worst sorts of pains that you can have I mean it can change you\nAre because a lot of times when you're nervous being pinched and the pressures they're it's constant it's like you cannot escape from this pain and uh I I've seen\nMold multitudes of people with this sort of problem I mean just miserable and you sometimes struggle to make them feel better um you know they're just crying they just need something to turn off that pain\nAnd we're a lotta times have to escalate to very high potency pain medicine just to get some some relief\nUm and a lot of times these symptoms can last for a few weeks now because they're really the thing that changes it than that immediate surgery right but nonsense that attend the surgeons not going to put you in the operating room\nSo most people will be managed with medications\nAnd it's just unfortunate that meant to do before we are behind the eight ball when it comes to treating chronic pain and they keep pain and we sometimes struggle to get control of that very efficiently and sometimes there's some collateral issues that we had to deal with side effects the medicine\nBut certainly you don't want to ever have this pain\nAnd so that's another reason to get your way down because the heavier that you are as you get older the more likely going to have some need paint some back pain and some neck pain 'cause you've that inflammatory engine\nThat I talked about before is constantly kind of at idle in the background kind of slowly tearing down that body so get your way down anyway I'm going to go my last brag you'd be back in two minutes to be right back\n... years ago

Fox News he said Donald Trump supporter suspected of sending a series of pipe bombs to a prominent Democrat a latent\nDown shift you didn't feel before coming to stop that shift and down and usually you get a smooth\nComing to stop and you feel this this bump and then all of a sudden what was that well I kinda feel like it might be the transmission Earl asked some money in the ...\nThen you call me and I say well that on this particular year model they had a problem with this so we'll need to just simply re flash in the computer flash computer with new information so it can handle the problem get it out of the way and it goes back to shift in smoothly\nShow most everything is computerized now yes or and or just sort of like our\nPhone so I'm always getting a another apple update they seem to be in ... he generally it says to repair some bugs from Alaska updating yeah so this is sort of what's happening with her\nWith her automatic transmissions is that flashes just basically I'm going to reprogram or I'm I'm putting in a program that's going to solve problems right that that we'll discover yeah\nExactly and they'll they'll see that and you know it takes groups of engineers to handle these things for you know the manufacturers and not just one guy out there saying okay we need to design this whole transmission well that's not the case and a lot of people make kind of think that in their mind but it says men is group of people and\nUh they're there to say the the manufacturer money in their designs\nWhich can be a problem sometimes but they're also there to uh\nTo try to fix what they had to design at that expense for the manufacturers so\nI'm back on our news you know so many cases and there's no sense going through all of them but with engines drive trains transmissions you see so many cases where the manufacturer has wanted to save fifty cents a car\nOr at three dollars a car and spent literally\nMillions and millions and millions of dollars to fix their mistake what if they adjust not tried to skim and save so Gary with they would have been a true vine\nAnd you'd think they would learn but they never quite learn so that that's the other issue that when you are looking\nAt a previously own vehicle might want to stop by and have you drive it around the block a to test the transmission CPU spotted sharing problems are at the very least give you a call or if it is a year that there are years that are just bad\nIt takes a pick up the phone true enough I mean and I can tell you real quick I was on well you know this one I'm a little skittish about that one out think somewhere else or if you do call up with one that I Know is a pretty decent one that didn't have any problems get it by let me check the fluid and see how it's going with it a\nAnd either way you know phone call\nOr come by I Know recently Jerry rentals a car pros that's heard here on Saturday afternoons at one he had to call that I cannot remember the bake\nThe model year which probably good this will protect the gear I ... just as well I don't remember it but the person was looking at a used vehicle was was looking at this\nAnd the very first question you ask is have they changed the transmission and it was apparently\nOne of the new ones run by rubber bands one of those yeah and I forget what the model was but he said okay the first year that was out was terrible uh they collapsed in about a a idol do eighty thousand miles away whatever he said\nYou're telling me it's got a sixty five Seventy thousand you're going to buy a transmission now if they replace the transmission\nGet the vehicle and live happily ever after so ah again there are those the people in the field can tell you hey that's a great transmission\nYou're going to get to free four hundred thousand miles out of it are my goodness that particular year that particular model\nThey mostly goes south at this miles and you're too close to take the ... and again it doesn't cost you anything to call a call on the edge automatic transmission and just get an opinion\nThe other thing to do and and he was very you know very specific in\nAddressing that issue was he said okay that was that year afterwards that's a great vehicle integrate transmission they address the problem we can elaborate\nThere so I'm sure you know that's why we're there is we know these things and we can tell you I have one in my shop now that\nHad several three or four years worth of a really just a bad engineering problems that they were just trying to tackle try it and I couldn't get over it but later in writer own they turned it around and it's is doing great so\nThat that's the other reason to be very cautious when somebody says well I owned or whatever right and you know they're all junk riots usually not so I think every menu factories maybe had a had a year that they don't want to talk a lot about sure\nIn everybody and their only natural ensure in in the you know a lot of people talk in general is in his line very gentle yes you know it's this it's that car it's that well there's a lot of good things about the car you know but it was just this one problem they had\nAnd most time they they fix it and come around to exit and they do better with it so\nYeah sure enough just give me a call and and uh if I don't know right off the top the head which most of the time I Do I can definitely look it up and call you back and say or bring it in if you're real real interested in it and it seems like a pretty good sound harder to purchase\nWell in of course a again at one bad year doesn't make them all bad but the other side of that coin is what I have people tell me that's why I Want to call you and get the expert opinion of what's happening or with this vehicle and what do you think about this this model and this year\nBecause also people that sometimes too you their junk don't tell you whether they surface that or not\nAnd so the person who says you know hey you that the it was like they say that if you didn't hold up ... oil though now a well okay so maybe that year wasn't defective after a lot of loaded uh Paso\nGeneral is an object to find out what happened what was what was yeah talked\nTo an expert before deciding that that's not a good deal there is talk five sixty kale vi we'll be back\nThank you for making April Colbert insurance agency Bomani

the business\nThe automatic transmission man I don't know maybe fifty fifty or something a lot of folks still had the uh the manual standard transmission don't see as many of those anymore do you know it was all\nIt had a sixty six ... in the shop we were for the break we were talking about you know\nUh how the engine has to signal right transmission computer will back in the day on for these computers and all this it was this the engine still had to let the transmission of somehow what it was doing the a vacuum\nOr a cable or a mechanical raw to some sort [noise]\nSee I didn't realize that set it always the engine always had to communicate with the ... we didn't use a computer to do it at a different\nWay no engine vacuum tells an engine load and\nThat might sound a little complicated to you but it really isn't and then just a a cable to ah for kicked down to go to lower gear so you can speed up faster than a or a cable to do the same thing and some of the later ones got cable to take their place in the back much later in the kicked down\nSo it would integrate it just into one and then it started growing and growing then computers\nAnd and ... and and now of

always the hard at the other day and I'm thinking\nOn a transmissions and this is probably normal for that transmission ... and they let me have alone or car today 'cause they had to do recall on and

but\nUh ten speed complication it's it's it's there and the time the shift having like when I take off in the truck is just most of the time and a shift from ... third to fit and then go six seven eight nine ten\nNow all of this just to add on to the other years well they'll use them like you were saying I guess it's what are you doing are creeping along in this traffic it might say that first a third is just\nIt'll get to a third and that's just almost too much of a load because you're not quite going fast enough but then it says okay I see too much blood drive and I'm going to start utilizing second gear and then a ... to then maybe three four one to four and five so\nDoes not have to go through every one like ... I Would think it was so if I Am a creeping along and some of the west in traffic or something we may go one too but if I'm heading out on the freeway or it may go along ... move all\n... yeah one three and then talk in ... in in the three five and ... and then so seven a\nIf you get on the road when I'm going higher we used to be a it kicked in the\nTent racy do eighty miles an hour and ten year with a talking murder clutch engaged and I'm doing barely sixteen hundred rpm and it's a a twin turbo three point five later basics\nBut it's just cruising line again that's an efficiency issues sure we're saving fuel Twenty one miles a gallon okay forward or pick a I mean and that's what we're looking for that you would want to bring that up now of course you're in the business so I'm\nSure the rice Rob Lowe ... yeah when they ... they are ours is out much would have a right teen miles a gallon to drive around for a hundred thousand miles I was gonna say I could probably save money at age ... miles per gallon but uh of course that I wouldn't get all the federal kudos if I'm the manufacturer ...\nBut that is the other other issue is that now when I Do come to the transmission shop\nYou're going to be chair again to eight ten speed transmissions versus the old three or four speech ...\nA on the spot I've seen it a verified it interval for you to come in and change that transmission fluid and keep a heavy expense off off the load near later you know well\nAnd I do think manufacturers sometimes a stretch that because that's good\nThat's good PR and I know that there's some formulas working into mileage and all sorts of other things or some formulas that work there that the longer you're maintenance periods are the better the some of the ratings are and all that\nBut as your vehicle and again we're in southeast Texas where it's pretty hot it's high it's pretty dusty uh we are as in more really to be honest I think we're more in a severe\nDriving situation than the normal driving situation and yet people many times are looking at owner's manual and they were not severe they do the other or you're never going to be harmed particularly with the cost\nOf a transmission where his chair and bringing it in getting flu it changed the way it looks fine hitting the filter change I guess on some ... ah that that's the other things I just bring it as you talk to your little about the transformation because they're so different\nNow your son or you don't have a filter or it's conflict by James ... kernel\nAnd you can't get to it and most of the ones that do have that have like a little external one that you can get to that you get you a but there are some that completely don't so uh it's best to get that fluid change down a as regularly as possible so the filtering remains free and then\nAnd it's it's always a good thing Texas is hot you mentioned that and now she's ... coming up on the uh winter now and it's a you know it things are okay during that sell it and there is a\n... little right if you're winter or summer it's still a tough time for the transmission yeah you got to you know we just we are not the gentlest climate\nUh granted it's not Montana but at the same time it's it's not a a a climate that are as severe I Would go to the severe side of the chart in a a\nA lingers manual lean more toward that goes with the engine to an oil changes in such a because again I I just don't think you're ever going to be harmed by doing some service work and you say well it caused but what does\nA major engine were caused major transmission work called I is it it's going to be expensive Iowa which we can do it makes me would say it's ah you go the imports to do what you were a little of everything you know yes are we sure do\nImports a most the ones we are getting a little bit more into the uh German side of it as St germ or you know\nType of software that we have to have that we don't see many uh but we're starting to seem more up now um but we're we're handling most mostly your your you know Nissan Toyota\nA infinity uh the\n... you know the\nWell if it were for many vehicle made out of that nature they sign are all these other ones some of them are are they made in America the made someplace else it's confusing now we used to say American Made and\nYou know sons has made in America it just depends on the on a model and and and what it is and then some of the big three are made somewhere else or hearts or somewhere else and so really we have gotten into\nA global markets\nAre probably other than a couple of the European models in such a really short of\nLocal markets in global car assembly\nAnd you have software to to meet all those are these days Chrysler's\nHaving a crush the three hundred she you know have a transmission Mercedes isn't it I mean it's all sort in the integration\nStarting to integrate I'm not sure that's a bad thing either because we were talking and role is out of time we were talking in the first program about the engineers gone bad here where you have a a transmission you have something that just doesn't work out for a year or so and you [noise]\nEnd up having to uh to fix it fix it fix it and and get that straightened out if you did use a little more as you say if you're using a Transportation's it's proven in one line\nAnd you put it in another line you're going to have fewer problems exactly using the engines and transmissions that have proven track records are using them a little more across the board doesn't seem to be a downside\nTo that are not at all and I do think those things and they stopped seen him do it to you know and it makes sense\nBut saves money for the manufacturer to doctrines passed alone does but it said that money for a manufacturer again located one forty five Sawyer you're the ... and that's behind the donor place by rangers\nNear where central used to be yeah near where somebody's if you can find eleven street the eleventh street plaza has decided to have early enough says eleven street plazas so right behind there in the edge automatic transmission you guys got a pretty good sign yourself you\nKnow we had the real tone up until a few years ago so I had to do with do away with that one it it was getting too old\nToo old [laughter] but still you've got a you've got a good side so it's easy to find stop by\nYou and you don't mind driving a vehicle around the block just to give it a little opinion obviously if you need more exhaustive a checkout there's got to be a fee but you've never mind just getting in the vehicle driving around the block and sharing your are\nYour thoughts with someone of bright\nThat much go right taken a trip down you know three or four hundred miles in something constantly worry about what you thought you should've done on the whole trip\nA peace of mind and just stop and buying leaving it for a few hours or just a phone call or a test drive and it's just nothing to do it three or four hundred mile trip and sitting there worrying about it\nThough that's like a picturesque drive down so an extra [laughter] anyway thank you very much for being with us but I still coming up next Fox News killed by Beaumont was the last\nTime you thought about your transformation all Jim love here and if you're like me you probably ever think about it and let's see there's deep for Dr are for rivers yeah you don't think about it but you're transmission it needs regular maintenance just like everything else on your car on your truck\nAnd if you're having problems with your transmission\nBring it to edge automatic transmission and discovered the benefits of are we plus fifty years of experience\nAnd let me tell you when it comes to transportation experience counts that adds automatic transmission they've established a reputation for excellence and work hard to be the best in what they do\nAnd it was a four hundred thousand dollar house that is not going to\nHave some sound right to me you\nKnow it's not right for us and it it it might be right in Louisiana because they don't they have a state income tax and their their property taxes are much lower than ours are substantially lower\nIt just it it is not right for here so that's something that's also very important\nWell and I was thinking another big danger there is when I'm dealing maybe with one of these Internet site says something out of market and I actually start through this process at some white have you had people discover\nThey really can't afford that at home because you're adding these other things too that monthly no to that final\nOn has before you fall in love with a house on fire\nRight because here's the thing that does happen a lawn or that happens and even more importantly\nVery often they can afford the the house that's not the issue the issue is how much money they have to close if your taxes and your insurance are way off that could change your coming to closing the money that you need to come to closing\nFour five six seven eight thousand dollars a year and that could be a huge deal I could be a deal breaker absolutely could be around you know you've you've got taxes and their twelve or Thirteen hundred dollars a month on some of these homes and some of them are more than that\nAnd you need we need three months that closing you've been quoted a hundred and fifty dollars a month\nFrom an Internet source that is just actually trying to get your mortgage business that's a huge difference there and that several thousand dollars plus your insurance may be the same way\nSo you may be looking at five six seven eight thousand dollars more money that you need just because somebody didn't know how to disclose that properly and those are things that can change\nWell the other issue too is that again as we've been seeing one size doesn't fit all there are many different kinds of mortgages as many different kinds of mortgages\nThat thrive you guys specialize in having this this big box of various mortgages then work in southeast taxes right I may not even be aware and in fact I Know that as a buyer I wouldn't be aware but many other companies may not even be where some of these things exist\nMost of them don't I mean most of the most of the most of the banks and credit unions around here offer pretty vanilla stuff that they offer a um they ... they do a great job what they do it's just that what they do is very limited compared to what we have to offer\nThis is sort of like shopping in a place where they have you know five or ten things to choose from versus a place where they have fifty things to choose from and act like not to the guys with only a couple of things you're doing a bad job but that may not be what I Want maybe I Want to try something\nElse here and it may not be the really best option for for the bar or the bar or may have other options that are much better for them than what they can get at their bank or their credit union and\nGet him in a home sooner than what a banker\nYour legs to able to get in the home sooner than\nA tell me about some of these options that you have some of the programs you have because I Know and thrive you have a lot of things some of the products that really people may not be familiar with or haven't been available before available on a very limited basis now this is available to a lot of folks who are looking for a whole\nIn and let's start with the name thrive we we just recently changed we've been gateway Morgan\nFor the last four and a half years in gateway as our great company we'd love to working with gateway we still a gateway gateway is awesome but we found somebody who has some more tools to help us more ... more tools for the box\nAnd at thrive we have just almost every kind of loan that you can imagine\nA lot of what we do is construction new construction financing we have\nF ha one time closes we have VA one time close as we now have um Ninety five percent of a two time close offerings so we can offer people\nWho maybe fell out of the single close loan program or if especially for the for the conditional loans ... we now have options for those people and we can do their loan up to Ninety five percent which is unheard of in the\nIn the are almost unheard of in the mortgage industry and FireEye she said yeah I'm construction loans so you can go out and find a house include the land all in it and and borrow up to Ninety five percent of it\nBe in charge of the project all while it's being done and then a week and we we handle it as a refinance when we get finished but it's just an awesome program an awesome\nSeries of programs there's so many of them it's hard for us to put a um you\nKnow to really tell people what it is that they want something else that we can do on a one time close and this is new this brand new for us uh we can now do mobile homes include the land\nAs long as it's a double or triple wide or a wider I think they make them now five and six wide but whatever or at least a double wide\nOr we can incorporate the land the septic system the driveway as the fences everything septic system water systems and we can do those up to Ninety five percent is well\nNow that some amazing news for a lot of folks are an three and a half ass right we we have that in an hour and a half ha program three and a half percent down there\nNot waiting on their credit scores when they get finance through the mobile home and financial institutions their credit scores determine their percentage down well that's no longer yes yes they can come in with the six twenty credit score and three and a half percent down\nNow she and I couldn't see you just as with any conventional home loan I should come see you first ally of slowly and then goes select the mobile home of the land and all of this but\nIt it it all has to praise out right we do a pre construction appraisal on that and when we get the mobile home include all of it ah the land everything else but uh and I actually can help with the mobile home park to okay\nYet you weren't right and and those go up to Ninety five percent so we've got the ability to with this little as five percent down or five percent equity which if you already own your land your land in your lot is probably worth more than five percent so you you're automatically approved into that loan\nOr sending the credit and you know as long as everything else is good\nOr we do those programs every day\nOr something else we we also do a hundred percent financing we have\nUh several different hundred percent uh financing programs we've got us ... USDA we have um we have the uh veterans loans\nUh from da ... both of those were a hundred percent programs we all from the Texas veterans land board program which is a smoking hot interest rate uh interest rate um it down to four and a quarter percent right now\nAre on a thirty year fixed mortgage which is a it's higher than it has been but it's it's still that's a that's about a ... point below market\nBut mentally truck to truck to before I think many folks are are probably a little young to remember some of the interest rates of the of the past and ah just how horrendous they really were in the seventies eighties in such a new interest is is going up a little bit it is still such a bargain is ...\nLow it is still historian and ah people like Ashley who all their lives have been very first has it has to have a the interest rates now are scary to them because they they don't understand what they ... they don't see that in context by Eighteen percent but I tried\nOur economy thriving I mean we have to enact land either Arctic honeybee thriving and everybody have jobs and everybody be making money and I have a little bit higher interest rate than\nAny and really it is just a little bit higher so you should not learned at rice hold you back\nIt's tiny amount and if anybody's wedding for these interest rates to go down I don't see that happening I think we're going to see him continue to go up um over the next two or three years\nSo did the best time to get a mortgage driving home is right now is John five ...\nFive sixty jail vi here's your chance of rain in your hand

load and I also warmer in the upper fifties near sixty no rain the release Monday is Greg ... market basket weather forecasts news talk by sixty kale vi\nRyan and start five sixty Kaomi ah broadcasting from ... studios\nNews jog five sixty kill the eyes we talked with our friends from thrive mortgage about they're realizing your dream of homeownership and still is a dream of most people in southeast Texas we read that various parts of the country maybe so maybe not\nBut here in southeast Texas do you guys find that what most couples want is they want to own their own home their own piece of property\nAnd I think it's only natural that people do want to own their own home it's a great investment it's it's probably still the very best investment people can make you have to have a place to live any way and are having that home is just a great a secure place to be\nIn rent and that area's more than a mortgage\nAnd and I have heard this so people and we need to probably say that again actually we go in and make sure people here that is that I have heard that actually you could probably get me in a home ... probably bigger than what I Am in apartment\nLast year and it's pretty it in the mortgage but if you're renting a house no question no question that you're paying way over what you would get apartment folks even a pardon my folks you\nKnow yeah because the apartment the ... year because of the storm are unusually high there are higher than they than they had been previously just because there's a lack of inventory\nWell and we were talking a moment ago\nAbout the interest rates in about two insurance earlier and such and Europe CPAs but I'm also going to get some benefit from owning a home that I'm not getting renting the home and renting the apart but Iraq's\nRight off the homestead your home and there's a lot of different ways to get money back from being ...\nPlus if I Want to paint the walls you didn't paint the wall without permission out if I can pay what a plant or a shrub here or whatever\nAnd and I think that's the appeal of a lot of people as they can do what they want it's their home plus as you start a family and such the idea of having a backyard some areas for kids to play it's just natural inside of you to actually wants that whole\nThat whole people back right now or credit scores and wanted to we ... around their head on that we can\nGet you in a home for a sub par credit score now if you've been saving your money and you have any money to put down we can get you in a home for under that five eighty if need be as long as you have some cash flow from work and and putting money in the Vatican hold and a\nHalf a ring of ... a good point here because you see on television you see various and you see this or you go to buy the car and they throw this number out there at you\nThere is not one number is is there for a credit score or when we're talking about buying a home that's going to be a different numbers and maybe I'm hearing from everybody else\nWill it can be um you know traditionally are most of our borrowers have actually very good credit or the majority of the people who come in and see if we can help those people who do have lower credit scores\nAre the type of compensating factor in most cases ah if if we're going down a especially if we're going below five eighty even if we're going below six hundred\nThey really need to have a some money in the bank or they they need to have something that's uh going it's going well for them they need to be able to put a little larger down payment down than just a a three and a half percent\nI'm In most cases and like I said we've got a few plant programs that still allow us to do three and a half percent down with lower credit scores but they need to have something they need to have something that they can show us that they need to have a little extra money in the bank or whatever\nOne hundred percent but I should see you guys to find out my credit score after handle just ah assume some number of the ... and\nThey always go off of what she does ... ... on the apps because some of those were misleading to\nMortgage polls are the hardest pulled it's going to happen so they're always I I've never had somebody come in and our our scores match the scores that they have on their ... I Want to experience it there always a little bit lower than we can also help them get their scores up pretty quick to get them or\nThe other thing you guys should don't mind helping folks talking to him giving him some advice in fact I've said before what a maybe a year or two even if I have some problems of L just follow what you're suggesting and probably get in a position to buy a home\nThat's right that's right we um we we help people every day uh realize that dream of homeownership\nIs right and maybe you've been working on your credit and your credit to great aunt but you get paid cash at your job or you have a ton of money in the bank but yet that your tax returns say something different that a lot more right a lot of things off when they on their own business and then the tax returns don't really reflect your income [noise]\nWeek announce they'll help with that as we can we do a whole asset loans and we also do things called bank statement loans you will take your cash deposit on your bank statements for the last twenty four month average him out and we can use it\nAnd then to one of those issues where maybe I'm doing fine but I'm I'm a plumber or an electrician and and the company owns my vehicle ... whatever I may have on paper I may have very few assets were in reality I have a lot of assets and a lot of cash flow\nRight and we can help you do that we lay it out or we can lay it all out figure it out and I'll be getting\nSo whether I perhaps have had some bad luck I Need a little help getting their credit score up maybe only go ahead and get in the home and I have a lower score or I'm self employed I have some money and many times when you looked at by some folks they may not realize that\nThat's right and the rates are much better much lower and the down payment amounts three and a half ... around much much lower too so it's\nIt's pretty unheard of for them to even find that five percent down payment when you finance their mobile home lender generally\nThat leaves you with the other things to do as well which ah which like a a site build home many times those things don't get done or they get done very many believe that fence may not go up that Dr may\nStay dirt because now you're you're you're moving on to other things the same thing you're talking about in some of these other homes where I can buy in renovate so what I'm going into the home and I'm getting the mortgage and I'm thinking\nHey one day I'd like to change that kitchen one day I'd like to change that ... I Lived right now\nDo it right now and that's it's never been a better time to do those right now\nAnd so you do literally ended up with that mortgage moving in to your dream home whether it's new or whether it's an older home that you've renovated that's right\nAnd a lot of the people that have the older homes right now that are waiting to redo kitchen or about and then and then in their homes for twenty twenty Thirty years they probably have a higher interest rate on their mortgage than we can get them for innovation Lund\nReally I don't know how to refinance yeah we can refinance recognized on and on Wednesday already has a homes and um and get 'em that renovation alone as well so I mean that a lot I had not thought about\nThat we talked about refinancing or some time back and I just sort of thought that will surely everybody is refinance it needs to but there are people out there that just\nDidn't realize I don't think about it kind of\n... and in some cases in some cases these people who need to renovate a as the war to renovate their home\nIn some cases they are going to go up a little bit on their interest rate because maybe they do have a three and a quarter percent is right right now and maybe it is going to be five and a quarter or whatever ... whatever it is when we do the renovation\nBut it's usually much less expensive to do that than it is to do a um it just a a renovation loan from a bank where they're adding another note on top of\nTheir their current note\nYou know if you're doing a second leaned out and you're adding another thirty or forty thousand dollars you're going to have a three or four hundred dollar payment on that you may be able to do all of it in one note and just and just go up a hundred and fifty two hundred dollars a month\nYou know something it appeals to me to not having these second leans at all these tests rather notes floating around but but like you say there could be some folks out there that just haven't thought about um having done it that still have some higher interest rates for ... years ago\nUsing all that cash they had in the bank probably get I mean given it this way holding onto their on their luck with cash\nProbably on the ... that that is something that people like to do what they really think it through with the interest rates better to hold onto the cash better to invest that cash than used that cash for somebody\nThat you're actually never happens you'll it's all just still sitting in just in your house Mm right\nWell we see a lot of people who just don't I mean they come in and they start thinking about it\nMy home is not very liquid or I Can't get my money out on if I needed for something or if I wanted for something I Can't just go down in and take money out of my home is a process and and it's expensive right\nPut all of your money into your home talk to your investment counselor most of them will tell you that uh they can make more money on on your asset then they can or on your cash than what you're going to end up with if you put it all into your home\nIn a vote come see you guys then you've got all these various a mortgage options all of these options available so I'm going to get the best deal on the mortgage\nAnd looked at cash separate investment advisor and make probably more money there than just because automatically I think some people think how much can I put down I better off the more money I pile in it the better off I Am not always the case in a home loan\nNot always we like to see people if they can\nThey can afford to we like to see 'em get down to where they don't have any mortgage insurance and so we like to see I'm putting twenty percent down or twenty five percent down um but a whole lot more than that really does make a whole lot of sense most of the time especially were interest rates are right now\nIt makes makes good sense again how do people reach you\nThey can give us a call my cell phone number is for all nine six by six to three eight three you can call right now and uh I'll take your call\nOkay Chris way in the south in it for the run on six seven nine eight zero five\nTo actually worked easy to find either one of you that's the other thing I appreciate about thrive mortgage is you are willing to work around people's schedules evenings weekends\nSo often many of these mortgage concerns or if it's not eight to five stuffed very convenient to fewer refinery worker hospital worker\nAnd sometimes we can't we can't answer the phone all the time on the weekends either but we will we will take calls we will help people with a\nUm yes the kids still want to be outside and see what's going on and they're very interested and uh you know\nTaking care of the environment and that kind of thing and so it's really important that we make sure that they understand how to do all of that\nIs a part of it also that we've become an ... David we've talked about this before with\nUh various ways to control a past and that sort of thing is that we have become more environmentally aware in is that some of the younger generations are the younger generations more environmentally aware giving them maybe an interested in the outdoors maybe they didn't realize\nYou know now they're they're wanting to do more with the outdoors\nI don't know I Know in our office we focus obviously it's because of where we live but we focus on taking care of our water right of water and the waterways that we have we also focus on taking care of you know the gardens and obviously our lawns in our trees\nAnd trying to live with\nUm you know the animals and the insects and everything else that that's down here that we face every day and we try to just make them aware of that part and you know you have to think about we have a lot more people living on the face of the earth now and we've got to start taking care of all of this stuff\nUm you know even our animals that live in the oceans and things like that we've got to start taking care of that and I think the kids are aware of that and of course with what we do we are trying to help them understand that\nBut that awareness into action well hey I'm I'm all for everything you said except do we have to be kind to the mosquitoes are thinking maybe [laughter] maybe maybe not\nThe mosquitoes but well you know why they serve a purpose to well I yeah I mean the frogs in the lives of those who say they are I just we we need more frogs and lose [laughter] but it is interesting\nIn that I I think there is a younger generation and the David we've talked about this before but you also find a a younger generation maybe of of home buyers homeowners and such becoming more interested in developing that yard developing a nice canopy of grass planting trees and\nIn doing landscaping and\nReally trying to uh make their place or a more negative nature friendly or or ... absolutely\nUm we are seeing a lot more individuals that are interested in a lot of our outdoor activities and of course gardening is probably one of those primary activities that everyone likes to get out and do especially when the weather's good and we're not you know burdened by the the rain that we've seen here recently\nBut uh the activities can range from lawns and gardens to a growing your own vegetables and I think that is a big thing and there's been a big push a here recently on\nKnowing more about your food and not just taking it at face value um so we work with a lot of individuals and grow it and helping them to grow their own food\nAnd are educating them we do a lot of education on teaching them you know what we grow here how we grow it and then\nWhat is involved and growing because a lot of people just don't understand the concept of what it takes to actually grow that head of lettuce or maybe that ah you know fruit tree I'm\nA lot of people think oh it just grows well yes it does but there's also some care that goes into it and some maintenance and upkeep to get it productive you know for example say a fruit tree I'm so that there are a lot of things that we focus on you know but a lot of it is education um and just consumer education and we we\nWork to teach our individuals that we work with and Stoller works with a lot of the younger kids and I ended up with a lot of homeowners sometimes but it's it's a good tradeoff because\nIf we educate the the kids and the kids can educate the adult or vice versa so are you know it's you know I guess what technology you know give a five year old a cell phone he can operate it and have had to take these it has to be just as adults but uh you know the adults are still learning phase and we like to learn and you know\nI think learning is a never ending process so that's what we provide is just a continuous stream of education\nAs well said true because I think probably ... life extension service and there's\nOf course a agents in every county in taxes it really is about education or whether you're again with for age you're starting a cute young and educating and teaching some life skills or

wanting to maybe get back to more to to a major and and learn more things for each offers one or just marvelous opportunities for kids to do so many things\nYeah and the umbrella is very large um and and they keep\nMaking new changes um leaves started and interior design because interior design right now is really popular uh you know like on HDTV and stuff like that\nSo we've actually started a project just this year they've launched it from the through the state office for the foragers for interior design so yes we run the gamut um you know\nWe still have a GPS project\nAnd um the kids learn to do math reading and all of that like we've already talked about we do outdoor education we still have all the traditional projects that you know as a child I Would have gone through like clothing and textiles and fit in nutrition and then of course all the animal projects but\nWe also have a dog project in fact our dog project going to the orientation is going to be a tomorrow I in the evening there at my office\nSo we actually do um you know have some other kind of animal project other than the kids having to raise a calf or ... or something like that so they can just use their back\nYard dog in common still get the experience that four H. offers um but you know not have to have anything fancy or something that's out of the ordinary that they wouldn't normally already have all kinds of ...\nWe haven't heard about the outdoors sings and animal projects and search which is what I think I'm going to think before age\nBut that's good observation that may not be for everybody and they may not have the space if they're not part of whatever plus you're keeping up with today's trends of the the uh the design these various things that the kids\nAre interested in today so really for age is for anyone I\nGuess it's going to be hard not to find something that your child would have an interest in\nExactly and I think more than you know the model for for ages ... well it's learned by doing and so that's what the projects are designed to do is to teach you whenever they come in and as somebody that's nine years old um they they learn the information\nAs they progress through for age as they get older than the whole process is now I'm going to as an older for a teacher teach the younger for eight years so that's again learn by doing\nAnd um you know as well as I Do if I'm I learn it better if I have to teach it and if I'm just learning it for myself if I have to explain it to somebody else or I have to teach somebody else how to do it I'm learning at batter will that's all part of leadership for them\nI was going to see it sounds like there are some other skills at play here or sue or many of these projects are going to require I assume meeting deadlines working now you're talking about perhaps mentoring and teaching so there's there's a lot of\nAll the life skills that we want our children to have\nAs encompassed in four H through those projects and it's all of the positive and skills that we want our children to have like you said meeting deadlines\nUm you know that's the I guess I called the fun part of our job is to get out of the office and go visit with our\nIndividuals and you know talk to them one of them on and kind of see what's going on and you know maybe a picture's worth a thousand words but uh you know let's say for example you've got a a a shrub or a plant is just not doing well ... um or you know maybe you got some issues with some insects and\nYou know I I just don't know what's going on or something like that too weak definitely can come out there and look at it and\nDo that and that's part of what we do a lot of people you know are kind of taking back you make house calls and you come out and look at it and I'm like well yes we do we do is go up and like I said that's kind of the the ... what we do we get to get out and visit with a lot of individual\nIt was in the community and to get that one on one connection with a lot of our individuals that we work with so\nWell and that's really cool aspect because sometimes I Do have trouble explaining and maybe the picture doesn't quite justify or maybe you have to see the surroundings a picture of the plant or the shrub or the garden and then you come out and you realize things going on around the edge that could be causing the problem\nBut you don't often think about someone coming out to your house to look at something obviously I Know in the commercial sector or you go out to many of the commercial operations and will help them but this is something you don't mind just coming to buy a house to look at the ... rose bushes that are doing well or whatever if we can't figure something out\nAbsolutely like I said it doesn't matter where if it's a for a ... our starlet goes out and looks at the projects on light um if there's a question or need that you know she can go out um our ag natural resources can do the same thing if it's more of a commercial type or even you know a small landowner\nUm you know just needs some advice on you know maybe I hate pasture or you know something like that I'm so we can pretty much accommodate just about any type of the site visits to hear two are individuals here\nAnd then suddenly we haven't really spend a lot of time on and that is the commercial side but you also have commercial agents and what are some of the things you help with\nIn the Jefferson County we do or what we do a lot of rice a fish that didn't various things we do commercially\nAbsolutely of course I think one of our major productions here in Jefferson County is what we're noted for his or rice production but to some other commercial aspects obviously is um some high production some cattle production\nUm of course we have some a sawed production turf production so we run the gamut as far as agriculture\nUm there's a few other you know unique operations commercial side but a lot of it is you know like I said our our main ones that we see which is a rice our cattle and our hay\nBut ah like I said if you have an commercial operations need assistance or have questions we can always reach out to us and we can help you and if we can answer it and then we can find you a specialist they can and\nSometimes I think we failed to realize as I've said before just how extensive some of these commercial operations are if we are living bowl logic working Belmont or whatever we don't maybe get out to all the parts of the county like you guys doing we don't realize just how much a\nPasture land or agricultural land there is in Jefferson County and it won't all use going oh this is big business in the county\nAbsolutely it's a a vital part of our income for the county and it is a a great revenue producer for our area\nAnd you mentioned that crawfish um it's ... the position of vacant right now\nBut we do have a marine agent position in our office that handles um does commercial end of things when they're it's crawfish oysters ... fish whatever we've got going on and I'm shrimpers\nEspecially out of Sabine Pass 'em that was the individuals the job that was there um she did a lot she worked a lot with those commercials shrimpers in that kind of thing so yes we do run the gamut\nIn that is interesting and again that's something you do for free of charge or or you're doing whether it'd be with me as an individual homeowner but also these commercial operations in which they're helping the commercial operation could be invaluable I mean well you're talking about a person's livelihood\nA lot of its regulations mesh whenever we're doing shrimping or or a ... a lot of its regulations and those are federal regulations and so we really didn't have to stay on top of that and make sure that those individuals that are you know doing all of that are are kept up to date every\nResource locally ... help you navigate those waters if you will so very very interesting and it it seems like there's really something for everyone at the ... extension service to we like to think so at the absolutely I haven't even mentioned you also have\nSome uh uh cooking and various classes which are\nA consumer oriented that maybe I'm not growing it myself but you're going to\nShow me how to prepare it in a healthy banner\nWell we haven't talked about her and we do have a family and community health agent in the office\nAnd that's her area her areas of food cooking she runs the gamut on budgets are you helping answer family questions and those kinds of things health questions we she does the large diabetes program\nAnd also um yeah she's there to help also and at the same thing she answers the phone she'll answer questions she'll do programs um and she also can decide visits also\nYou know before we finish up and we're almost out of time you mentioned programs any of you are willing to do a program for a group on your particular specialty I suppose so ... called the number and you'll talk to a group about what you do and getting more people involved\nWhether it's a big organization that needs to have a guest speaker or something like that or whether it's church and they'd like to have some specific information for their parishioners that they're in church um yeah\nAh one of the things that I Do as I have a large what I call it the chip program and I actually going to go in the classroom\nAnd I take fertilized eggs into the classroom and we had them in the classroom and then the kids get to work with the baby chicks for a while so you know so I get into the classroom a lot and I and our school\nOnce again hands on exactly it's hands on so they really retain its hands on right of a kind of situation where we are out of time thanks for being with us

massive discounts on all of our most popular model get fifty five hundred dollars off in Missouri they all knew twenty Eighteen roping stockpiling Smith Nissan dot com torn orders rice I'm forty eight so I went to the dealer website for the tale book into by a car online shopping\nAnd it's sad to say and it may be somewhat it incorrect assumption but many of us when you think about a shitty animal shelter you do think okay if you don't complain the period of the only reason found if it's simply a stray them lose a pet is going to be euthanized when you're working to change that\nAnd make these pets available in the two people in southeast Texas people in Beaumont but also and this is such an innovative way you founded this nonprofit\nAnd you actually tricked approach to the north as you say apparently not a surplus in some other parts of the country so very or more than happy to receive these pets for adoption\nThat's very exciting and the Internet a lot of responsible for making them realize they're short of pets and we have pets and\nAnd then transport is a big key so I ended up buying an airport shuttle bus or album up has alive is buying airport shuttle bus and then just recently a second cargo car air conditioned\nUm trailer so we'll be able to do even more transporting my having too accessible vehicles to go in different directions\nWhile and again it's reported emphasize the tea or a bull my pets are live action on profited separate from the city or in a commercial business or whatever so in order for this idea of continuing to flourish\nDeserves to be funded by volunteers in by fundraising you'd need people support\nIf you're serious about not wanting to see animals euthanized in the shelter lose only so much for into the city can do and and so much I just really folks in southeast Texas can do because there is no shortage of pets here\nWell the thing is great in the Austin has become an oak Hill City and they've done it through the help of fosters so if people locally are able to foster a pet I Would love for him to log on we have a website now Beaumont pets alive\nAnd you can email and tell your story and say I'm willing to foster cats or kittens or a dog and it doesn't have to be a long term\nCommitment because the transports are going out every week or two but sometimes it might be a two week or a three week commitment and then we'll take that pet and get it moved to another area\nSo that's basically how it's going to have to work and we're going to try to get all these animals out they have to go somewhere until we can get them on the buses\nEmerged shoving it many people do they may not feel like they want to have a a a ... maybe ... or traveling whatever we may not feel like they want to have a ... a year round but if they have some time on their hands\nAnd are willing I Love animals they could foster for a few weeks and help to save or petted ... going out\nAbsolutely then they get to know the pet better mhm when it's not just living in a cage that shelter and then they can actually help write the story about these are the things is pet does and then that really gets it a better adoption chance when people say that story on Facebook\nAnd again we wish recovered we'll be talking about a lot of influence our but once again when you're sending these transport so where does it go down there going up north you should go\nWe have a great relationship with um a a\nShelter and sterling Massachusetts that has seven veterinarians and they actually have an adopting out shelter so Massachusetts oh Massachusetts and then we go to Seattle, Washington where we have about three different um rescues that we have relationships with and they're up in British Columbia and\nThey can send to turn it down to Seattle and then transport up so it's very exciting and I mean all of the things take time in a relationship building\nBut the fact that we can get the healthy animals out of the shelter and transport them is fabulous so you know it does take money to get the buses down the road and fix the tires and the transmission\nBut it's a great way to save the lives\nNow I Know that you probably have some fundraisers or you're in the past but you always except donations for Beaumont pitch alive how would people do you watch the website you'll be going to make a donation\nAbsolutely the website is about my pets alive dot org and there's a there's a donation place and you can just click on that and fill in and you can do something mentally you can do a one time we appreciate everything so yeah just Belmont pets alive dot org\nWell actually about that again if you don't feel like you could foster maybe you're in the part butter situation where you can't have pets in a rebel you can do that you can always do need a little money to help her program go and a junior everybody shoveled going up every few weeks\nWe do and why didn't make it clear we can't take pets in\nFrom anywhere because what we're really doing is the shelter says we're going to euthanize these tomorrow\nAnd I got it okay I can fix this one I can see that one and so we're pulling from the euthanasia ... and it's not that we're just taking him heads were were literally taking them off to euthanasia list on driving their lives\nAnd an important distinction where you're not just changing your ... your judgment often listed\nAnd that's the only place we're taking a problem because you know that's their last resort\nThem Jerry I guess it varies I'm not familiar with some of the the rules but how long has a pet generally jobs or is it just depend upon how crowded that facility may be able to be given time\nWell their their attitude is changed they want to become an oak Hill City which will mean that Ninety percent of what goes in comes out alive I'm at right now we're at Seventy percent but we're up\nFrom twenty Fifteen before I had ever gone in there they only out of twenty seven percent live release rate while so now we're up to Seventy percent laterally relate\nIt's it meant eight hundred more animals last year came out alive while than the year before and it's probably going to be higher than that this year since we've gotten the nonprofit go in and the transport vehicles organized a little better\nAnd so it's exciting to save that many lives they try to keep them as long as they can up to thirty days\nAnd the owners surrenders they don't usually keep them as long if they're really crowded so we have to really you know watch those and pull them a little quicker mhm um but but they try to give them to anyone to thirty days before they run out of time\nWe're going to continue our conversation with Dr Kelly cherries and uh how you could help all my picture live a little more about the shelter and I promised before the movie our really get a little bit about pet care I think we all\nHave a pet most of us have a pet surely since I'm always had them always assume everybody does ...
