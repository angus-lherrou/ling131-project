the Saudi Government should be considered innocent until proven guilty so I'm not sure how this is going to turn out the ditch or\nThat that was pretty bad what I'm hearing about what they did that fell on but you know what they don't report he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd he was a a good friend of the Saudi family before this new regime change and there's been more liberal things happen and I'm sure he's been actively opposing those changes so uh\nUh he was he was a journalist for the Washington Post yeah ... well that\nYeah but he's also still a citizen of uh he's he's ...

Eighteen people\nUh we did outside of Austin but we were the long horn river ranch south of dripping springs beautiful property\nBut because of the weather and all the vehicles are park and what was a lovely\nIllness which is not only big muddy mess and we had to pull the plug late that morning ah and my comment misses the board of directors really the Texas Autor riders association because they\nDid a really good plan B everything would move back to our a hotel in the ... area and we are based in out of their underground parking garage a kind of put a damper on the off eroding but still you know everybody got to get in the vehicles and make their judgments and so on and they did a a really a great job\nAnd then we went to the first the second evening to think all camp Lucy south of dripping springs okay after dinner really neat facility and or in the end we did buses were rerouted because of roads it already were underwater guy and so then we crossed over this little low water bridge\nOr in the uh the water is laughing under it and then there's ... said to me when we leave to come back out\nFortunately there was a rain gauge because it said oh no it's got to see the water over it now so we went hoops I think we need to go and the other way and uh you know had to maneuver around them but then later on you know look at the news\nThe levels that some of these lakes got to I mean obviously if another flooding in Atlanta that got all the publicity and the damn being washed out\nBut the height of that water now you know I mean I'm telling you you know that bridge we'd go all the time and Leno here ... downtown to get to the bottom of that bridge I mean that's like one sixty feet up in the air or something a\nMarble falls up that cliff for that the the chilies in the hand an instance on and got to the top of that cliff rewards I mean it's just a mind blowing\nThe Colorado River I mean um it's interesting you know the the old adage of if you don't like Texas weather is wait a minute they deserve it really is but I'm just look\nAt the past seven eight years huh we go back to ... eleven in were mirrored in a you know devastating drought yeah and everything is down um ...\nFor those that are regular vision to the program and when we get to the outdoor report and we and you do the portion on the hill country wise and Travis we watch it slowly decline huh you know because\nIt's not a constant level like a cannon is named\nCNN LBJ is a constant level right up and so um then you've got a situation where the forever islands are ... are are there sometimes ... are starting to show back up and then you have a situation where I'm\nLike was about twenty five feet low was what we're reporting right over the past few weeks and I'm\nWithin a twenty four hour period it jumped up twenty feet down and ah last time I looked you know we're about twenty feet high correct I mean that's that's a lot of water it really is and and and here's the other thing folks and you know central Texas is dealing with it right now\nBut in Florida I got to be able to go right I mean so for so for those that fish around matter Gordon and where the Colorado River goes in the diversion channel or the or the river itself a that's a lot of fresh water\nKind of sort of good news bad news and you are a ... been a fisherman forever so what's what's the you know the after effect on the Gulf from all this\nUm in in the Gulf I mean that's where everything will end up dissipating tides and wins you know and it's going to mix and then in the slums who I Will will will adjust um but what you've got because of now the early cool cool weather really cold or whether there would have seen\nI'm Talking to captain Tommy ... saying hey you know assuming we don't get a lot of runoff\nColorado River will be in play you know coming up for the next already knew right next few months and well that's gonna really be taken probably out of the equation\nFor a while I'm while the river run off you know occurs um but this goes up and down you've got I mean on the upper co saying just send the trinity\nUm folks when you're looking at your weather forecast and look at the Lone Star state if it's raining up in Dallas and that's going to impact you know the upper coast right once you get past south of Victoria impact is not as great to the coastal\nA but it's more more inland so um it's um [noise] it's crazy\nAnd Bob Barr producers sitting on the edge of his seat on a noted the farmers' almanac predict any of this or well and I met a lot of people didn't ask me for the farmers' almanac say about our winter you know I don't know I asked bill\nYeah I'm Crazy forecast and I'm trying to get another confirmation on it but they're saying that the northern portion of the country Minnesota that area of the Dakotas ride are going to be a milder than normal but\nTexas and certainly along the southern part of the Gulf Coast\nOr on over into the southern part of the country is going to be colder than normal normal and I'm going wait a minute the cold air is going to come from the noise we're supposed to come from yeah yeah how how are they going to be more mild you know um but uh ... yeah it is\nUm got some national news um we've talked about the weather sucks little politics as it oh of course as it relates to um our Second Amendment rights\nAnd those that always think they have a better mouse trap when it comes to gun control or this is coming from San Antonio Texas and the city council OK okay is discussing whether to move forward on one or more proposed municipal ordinances that would limit that would limit\nWhere new firearm retailers could set up shop within the city limits although\nThe current view seems to be the the sixty a federally licensed and retailers would be allowed to continue business in their current locations city staff continues to research proposal one city councilmember called the proposal a feel good measure\nI could call it ... as you go and you're being yes only are nice right hum NSF spokesmen like Mike ... a told the San Antonio express news those truly affected by me this orange\nSays no matter how well intentioned are lawfully operated businesses and their customers criminals will continue to get their guns as they always have mhm illegally yeah\nYou got it you know so um so do we know who the edge it is to propose this thing [noise] don't\nKnow where they came from a man you know I mean I Know that information was not provided but [noise] it's um it it is it is really frustrating\nThe other thing that is being discussed and um this is this is in Congress uh-huh and it is a um federal a ... a federal an access proposal but there's about six hundred and forty million acres of public land right\nIn western states where the majority of our own national forest and bureau of land management property lies that cannot be accessed\nBy the people of the United states we own it right we should be able to use it why can't we access it um because it's surrounded by private land Oh yes and um so um\nI Know that when I was working on ranch deals out west I mean that was kind of a thing I mean that everybody looks for is G I probably did backs up to be allium\nYes exactly and you know it with the rugged terrain you basically um can lock the gate and mother nature's created the rugged

district leader rusty would rusty welcome to Texas outdoor news how are you this morning\nI'm good thanks ... ... residents Harold is important question how's the weather\n[laughter] and we're trying to dry out we may have had their water\nYou know that has been the case um for the past several years uh with heavy rains that have we seen flooding the area of course we know the hill country in central part of the state is dealing with it now but I'm coming out of last hunting season when a deer started drawing employers\nBack ah say march April the timeframe\nOr how how are things shaping up in your district\nWhere water early on um we had really Tommy Franks and browse habitat was only in really good shape or wasn't till we hit you know late in the summer that we really started to dry out\nWell you know they say Texas weather if you don't like it wait a minute has the worm turned 'em did that the the drying out did it impact mass crop and now has the rain brought on some of the fall for jobs\nYou know I think we turned out All right um\nThe north end of hunting which turned out a little drier and even got into some of the severe drought indexes environments but closer down in an academic just so far there shall we never quite got into that extreme drought that they did further north but overall I still think for a good shape I think that for al sailed out fine and then you know we've got some town they range\nTowards the end of August and September of course and things really shifted I\nThink the mascot turned out fine and certainly the or the browsers fun as well\nOh you're the different creeks and a repair in areas that we've got in your district\nUm that that gets used to be some really thick country and that's where some monster a monster white pills um you know are are are hiding out when we have heavier range was like this and water comes up a little bit is there a certain displacement that that moves critters into other areas that may present an opportunity for hunters\nYeah it takes quite a bit of water to really push them out of those bottom but they definitely hit the high ground that no one has come for sure\nYeah we'll going to put a bow on our whitetail before we move on to some other critters uh how would you um raped the amber development for this year average or above or below and same thing on body weight\nYou know I think uh I think it's just going to be an average year based on what I've seen I've seen quite a few truck camp pictures from and and information from our landowners surveys and things look like they're often get started I wouldn't say it's sexual here but I certainly think we're a great shape for the coming season\nOne of one of the things about the east Texas it was so heavily subdivided\nAnd now we've got wildlife co ops that have been put together I Know the big management plans for ground nesting birds um how ... how are the ... co ops and how is a a for our eastern turkey how's that going on in your district\nYeah you know we've we've done pretty well we've got a few active co ops that we've got turkey is on the ground for we uh we finished stocking and last year uh up in the north end of our district up in Marion County I'm In and we've got a few more they're going to get evaluated a\nAnd the coming year for possible stocking so the turkey a restoration work has has been a great model for success\nAre ... just river co-op area um they're really seeing a lot of good success from this\nUm I have heard in need you to confirmed that ah that management strategy or if it works for ground nesting birds that works for white Taylor worked for a pretty a broad range of critters is that right\nWell I think so you know it's a\n... and the case of a ground nesting large I think that there's a threshold back in the old days they worked and block stalking [noise] uh you know where they were putting out smaller releases of ours and and it didn't take a whole lot of mortality whether it be from capture mop the or just a you know natural mortality from for predators\nTo a really not corner those\nAnd they they kind of get hit I'm\nReally by a lack of nesting cover you know these range lands when when you don't get apple precipitation in the spring and\nFall 'em like they tend to become a little depleted in terms of forage growth and as well as as nesting cover growth growing vegetation so sure nesting coverage not their weight than that the turkey flocks there's also the other game barge tend to suffer\n... it'll be have the same effect on quail then right\n[noise] it well and you know ... never been known for or at least not in in recent decades for a quail hunting [noise] um although we have a few bright spots out west for ... scale ... hunters but\nBefore we run out of time we got to just about a minute left um hogs are we talking about harms we see the damage and the route routine but then when you have heavy rains like those\nReally gets into an erosion and I mean you can actually ah him hard routines around ... end up living soars streams increase right\nAnd that's that's a fact you know but you know you see two things [noise] they they ... when when we get this kind of rainfall they're able to expand their ranges and exploit habitats that they normally wouldn't because there's there's so much water availability [noise]\nUh and and they're feeding on top of that um you know not not picking on the air hundreds that's for sure we all hung around corn fighters jar laptops but at fading they are also allows and those up on habitats allows those talks

can cause a sudden episode of severe diffuse muscle and joint pain fever Eighteen is just you feel do you feel terrible\nAnd ah that's inflammatory system when is kicked up and that's more likely to have caused your symptoms are less likely mano so [noise] you know we only have about five or ten physical symptoms of just about every disease known to man and so there's overlap\nWith the presentation of illnesses and that's why a lot of times\nI recommend if you go to your health care professional they give you a diagnosis and you don't get better are you just something's not right gotta go back\nBecause it gives them the opportunity to reassess your symptoms reassess their impression maybe\nThere's something else going on which is why you have to go back and get more testing now the physical examination to try and again can from our disapprove whether or not you have something 'cause sometimes we we're not sure [noise]\nSo um these inflammatory markers which normally are called the sediment ... rate\nAnd C reactive protein [noise] are are basically little markers that\nGave us an indication of the degree of inflammation in your body doesn't give us a disease necessarily just lets us know if your body's inflamed [laughter] and the higher the numbers go then typically the more inflammation that's going on in your body\nAnd patients typically we have more symptoms the hiring goes\nSo the rheumatologist are in ... they they are a arthritis specialist so they studied diseases that attack the Moscow skeletal system and some of the more well known diseases are lupus and rheumatoid arthritis\nOr you've seen those diseases on TV or we have the inflammatory bowel diseases as well like groans and all sorts of coal light is so and there's a whole host of other inflammatory diseases that are not so common but anyway they studied those diseases\nAnd um so I think I Would agree with you as a as you were telling me about the your history one of the first thing that popped into my head is this guy needs to go see a rheumatologist and so you told me that I'm like hey they did the right thing [noise]\nAnd so they'll you know do their testing and stuff and see if they can figure out if you do have a room until logical illness\nSo sometimes when you have\nEven like lupus rheumatoid arthritis the blood test\nWill not be that high but you can still have the disease\nAnd it's going to be up to a skilled physician someone who sees these diseases on a regular basis to make the diagnosis\nSo I think everything sounds about right and I think everything's what you're doing is appropriate um if sometimes we do throw in some steroids if the anti inflammatory or non\nSteroid all and I'm planning to medicines are not working well throw on some ... zone\nAnd that a lot of times we'll give you some significant benefit as well um some physicians are health care professionals are a little hesitant to use ... they don't a lot of potential side effects issue so maybe there's some reluctance on their part but sometimes you can just take a short\nBrief course of steroids like for a week just to see if it'll give you some benefit so that's something that you can ask them to do um and there's several different types of steroids to take show but sounds like everything is is going along ...\n... ... well let me give this a what's confusing I'm not part of the ... uh they then all of the auto man and the facts and again I all these letters flashed by your you know they did a oh two weeks ago\nAnd I and it was just a more specific is everything came back negative if it could be that yeah and that's what confuses the auto plants has come back negative a\nWise you know and I have to say I'd ever proven you know I've lost weight mhm uh uh maybe I'll get my protein and all that I mean ... I've lost ... pounds of normally\nSix three two or three to five and I'm like well in eighty eight mhm um and the athletic all my life or if it just\nI don't know it just uh I Do believe that by Bach or that I had bought into a\nAnd not just in my case the case of of all these uh a joint issues and uh oh one other question I have in regard to shop now should\nI get my flu shot do it every year usually by the time so they get it or wait oh I've I've I'm totally better how should I Do the\nUh the the the the medical literature to suggest that you should get it um there is no country in the case in point for you're getting the flu vaccination so I Would encourage you to get it\nAnd getting back to your original confusion again or sometimes the blood tests that were ordered for you sometimes they are\nNegative for this slightly abnormal they they just don't look abnormal but you can still have a room with a logical illness you can still have it that's why I think it's a good idea if you go and see the rheumatologist\n... sometimes there's a small percentage of patients they have the disease but the blood test just don't fit and so you have to a doctor that sees it on a regular basis to really\nWho has who's able to kind of make the diagnosis the finesse that you need to make the diagnosis so uh again it's all I was going\nOn for I've been referred to on I haven't heard back from huh at this point but\nYeah it sounds sounds like everything's okay like I said probably the only thing if you're still suffering a little bit is may be asked him for some just a brief dose of some steroids or which normally helps with all types of inflammation I use it a lot even for upper respiratory infections [noise]\nI'm just a brief seven days to weeks now a lotta time to give you some relief and especially if if it's outlining you and you can't move around and you just feel terrible or some steroids can make you feel very well [laughter]\nI I really enjoy your show are are you said it will give us a call ... whenever you ah get finished our up and so we can talk about it\nI've just found you know and I have to say I'm feeling much better than let's say a month or more of a cool ah as far as the weakness and of course it's just a you know little things like when you can't or they even\nThere you know have some issues with intermittent swelling and that's swelling and fluid accumulation can produce some low grade inflammation that can cause some skin changes and again just um you can just Kassem chronic a deem a swelling down there nothing bad\nBut if he gets severe then yes it can cause really nasty ulcers that or you have to get wound through before they get infected and can sometime\nI needed something like that yeah well it's it's a different process to not having one\nYeah ... it's it's it the wound problem comes from a different process but yes diabetic patients get\nNormally wounds from arterial artery problems this is a vein problem I got 'em but nonetheless the skin is open it's um the immune system is affected\nIt's a quarter of injury for bacteria can cause a lot of problems so it sounds like your condition is not that severe\nAnd you if you did nothing you'd probably be okay but you you know you know hey my legs little swollen they ate the skin is changing colors I don't like it\nUm and so it might become dislike irritating issue but shouldn't sideline you too much\nOkay you've been a great help and an automatic thank you so\nI get to appreciate the phone call and we're going out first break his dog living in a non six Kelvin

I've been doing it for about a week [noise] and no change well uh\nUh I still have ... ... ... yeah what medicines you take other than what you've already mentioned\nOkay I ... a a a course Lauren\nWhat's the ... pressure medicine or frail or does it have a direct can it\nGet a ... yes [noise] that's probably it [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI've I've in my experience I've found that any dire Reddick\nCan are typically will maybe a contribute to some mild cramping and if if it's bothering you that much you can have a talk with your practitioner about taking the dye radical way [noise]\n[noise] and putting you on some non diabetic blood pressure medications to see if that will help us as you know the cholesterol medicines to Staten in particular are a can sometimes be very irritating to the muscular Jerome muscles\nAnd so sometimes it can be a side effect of this debt medicine as well and all you have to do again do this under the advisement of your health care professional or or are in talking with them or maybe\nFor two or three weeks discontinue the Staten and see if you're cramping goes away you know if it goes away\nThen sometimes you can change the stat and to a different one you can lower the dosage or the frequency of taking this that and so that the the cramping goes away again cramping is not anything life threatening it's not injuring use not harming use just irritating little side effect\nSo huh is major I sometimes Yes sir I see like one time\nYeah so I I Would ah again you have to talk of the health care profession but in my patience my experience if I have a patient come in with cramping there on a diabetic I'll just switch out the direct ... it'll take care of it\nThe other thing you can do a ... I'm a big believer in tonic water Tio and I see and that's something\nThat you bought some yeah\nOkay like a glass or two a day and a lotta times will alleviate that as well it has a chemical in called quinine which used to be available but ah it's still in tonic water so I Would try that as well\n\nOkay a cluster always promised that [noise]\nYeah and that's a good product to post to have the least amount of side effects with again everybody's different and again if you're starting to have physical symptoms that are persistent it's\nReally no big deal stop the promise that again on advisement of your health care professionals stop it for a couple of weeks and just see what happens\nOkay mhm anything else buddy that should do it All right appreciate the phone call call us back let us know how you did okay okay All right have a good evening All right Mary from Lake Charles how you doing\nI'm doing good I have a question about um your opinion rather on infrared light for pain I have fibromyalgia and I was interested in knowing that you're not\nUm it's been around for a long time I'm Mary and uh they used to uh promote that to treat diabetic neuropathy and uh it didn't really quite whole attraction and uh I I don't see a lot of practitioners offering that right now\nAnd I'm as you know ... a very difficult disease to treat and um it there are a lot of practitioners out they're offering all sorts of things\nTo help people feel better and sometimes these sorts of treatments\nDon't actually have the proper research behind it to really heavily promoted\nAnd infrared is probably one of those sorts of treatments doesn't mean it won't work for you and I'm with any sort of treatment that you do you have to be concerned about the potential for adverse reaction\nAnd you'd have to talk to their practitioner who's pro wanting to do that\nTo see what the possibilities of what might go wrong if you undergo this treatment\nSo I Would say for you you know if you're if you're feeling terrible and you you can't function and The Simpsons too severe and ... and you are you trying to be aggressive with your recovery\nThen I Would talk with their practitioner kind of get a good idea about what the potential injuries side effects of this if you if you've listened to that\nAnd you say to yourself that's not bad I Can't accept that and I would try the treatment um you know for a month two months and see what happens a lot of times this stuff is cash\nOr the insurance companies don't pay for it again because the research is not their right and it's unproven but sometimes in these situations you have to do what you feel like is necessary for you\nAnd you can't necessarily rely on the system to take care of you are as I've told most patients\nOr the medical community western medicine does not prioritize every medical condition out there unfortunately there is a financial\nComponent to a lot of what we do in this country and the the corporations and the companies that are doing their research like pharmaceutical companies [noise]\nUm primarily that she was doing most of the research in this country you have the governmental agency the un I H National Institute of health and then you have five land through pissed or philanthropists kind of like a Bill Gates you know people who have a lot of money but they want to do something good for the world\nSo those are really the people doing all the research out there for diseases and if you're diseases not on anybody's radar\nNothing happens there by treatment there's no nothing so you're left with what am I going to do for me\nWhat a black or are they it it's like they offered a pat\nThat but again yeah unknown causes of cramping we have that and so quiet and has no one would I use\nIt at magnesium ... Martin and as a former potassium attached to 'em yeah ...\nSome potassium some people and make museum as well I mean if you're levels are off particularly low then yes so you'd have to get that checked and they typically are off if your\nOn a diet Reddick are your some for whatever reason the hydrated let's say you\nAre working outside a lot and you get dehydrated are having a lotta diarrhea throwing up that's normally when we see abnormalities or the potassium magnesium you're throwing up diarrhea a diabetics otherwise we normally don't see that there are some diseases that can spontaneously cause\nA low potassium in a low magnesium but we don't see those at Austin so some people will go to the supermarket and grab\nThe electrolytes supplements and take them and for some it works I've just relied on tonic water\nAnd it works and so that's what I recommend and I don't normally because it works well I don't really have to go to a second or third medicine to ah help patients again unless there's some medical issue that I'm treating like I said a dehydration thyroid disease Jonah stab Nick\nCetera uh but uh I I\nCertainly you can try those I mean there's all kinds of relatively safe the dosages that they have over the counter pretty small and some people have benefited from supplementing their diet with electrolytes like Mac needs met potassium certainly talk to your health care professional before you\nDo that a and make sure they're OK with that but um\nNormally the cramping is mild doesn't happen that often are you exercising I Know you exercise\nYeah I ... yeah all that it weakens San Antonio it's been rainy and cold I haven't uh haven't that match but yeah I mean I exercise regularly\nOkay well sometimes if you'd overdoing it\nThat can sometimes be irritating to the the muscles especially in the cash 'em but doesn't so that's the case either and you haven't changed anything else about your diet or last dollar and you know that ... sometimes over the counter medicines that we think are neutral\nAre benign if we're taking those for whatever reason and can be irritating you know supplements and nutri suit of clothes and things like that so I'm not doing any of that either\nOut okay yeah All right thank you well welcome\nAnd we always love it when you come visit us in Bangladesh is\nWell we're headed out to have that the mom here and the

... at the end of the town is like my ... on the eastern the pressure of the way our shit I'd be concerned\nAbout some other techniques like when I Do like my I'm stuck Piedmont had been killed me on a I used to lean against the skin to come from\nA good step dance I should be concerned about\n[noise] um you know a lot of uh yeah a lot of friction and heating moisture can cause a production of production of excessive skin callous basically\nIn the end it's just a protective response protective mechanism of your foot from the pressure\nOf wearing a certain shoes are depending on what you do so it's kind of it's just a reaction to protect your foot that's what your body's doing it's not dangerous um and certainly just getting your feet manicured or periodically to remove the excess skin will help out\nAnd I I think the Vaseline quite All right as well um I don't hear anything from your story that would concern me\nUm so I don't think you know a lot of a foot specialist are concerned that the shoes are\nVery damaging to your foot and you can certainly understand that just because\nThere's a lot of excessive pressure on the foot that it's not designed to tolerate that much pressure all day long so those fashionable shoes a lotta times can create a lot of foot problems just because of how the pressures are redistribute on foot so\nI mean fashion is important and some ladies do it and they suffer long term from all sorts of flip problem so um you know that should be in the back of your mind but I think periodically it's not a big deal\nWasn't adequate crushed by toenail could grow like in my skin what can I Do kind of a thing that I mean everything in our country and pretty regularly is that just something that I wouldn't say I read it got just something that happened\nYeah getting back to the foot where if if you're wearing certain types of shoes that are putting pressure on your toes and that certainly can't contribute to that are probably ask her health care professional get your referral to a podiatrist to get kind of a update on your your foot care and see what else they\nOr what have for you but certainly there is some things that you can do to try and help produce that\nOkay back to some kind of thing that he had today\nYes ma'am have a good weekend and would appreciate all the phone calls this session session is over and a shack next week remember drinking water and do some exercise and and be safe out there don't drink and drive and have a good weekend and we'll be back next week\n[noise]\nWe are\n... if you will\nWork for a selfie

freeze or whatever is not the time to be thinking about your automobile now do that early on oh\nNo absolutely not I mean you know then it got to repair it can be\nNail it may prevent a problem later he shouldn't have to you shouldn't look at it like I Need to to\nThis off until it I have to procrastinate it go ahead and do the the maintenance and that requires ... would you call winter rising summarize you know the only cooling systems and the hoses and your belt because nothing\n... you can run haters in shop but it's still a quite as\nAs comfortable to work when it's that cold\nYeah and it makes sense to uh you know these days because we have a lot of sort of all whether things we don't make a lot of changes maybe between summer and fall\nWe talked about winter rising what are we talking about him and really summarize it gets so the same thing but it just it gets down to checking fluids in right in the ...\nTest and batteries are because batteries take a big hit on the weather gets cold and it takes a big hit when it gets hot and the the sudden change from one to the other will kill a battery if it's marginal every time\nSo you do need to uh check batteries and such and ah when you are checking a battery or one of the things you need to do I would think ah well I'm if I'm looking for a battery what am I looking for in a battery might spend a moment on that because usually when I Need the battery\nIs when the battery in the vehicle is dead so I'm I'm not exactly doing a lot of shopping and thought I'm just getting me a battery where you and you're looking for\nA battery looking for something that's got good nationwide coverage okay they you know you have a\nBattery such as like an interstate battery ... a lot of mom and pop places and sell those you know a gas stations things of that nature um\nThen you have your box stores and then you know that that happened but I tell you when you when you're making a selection on a battery if you reached out to pick up a battery one hand and it doesn't feel very heavy in a in a good bad\nOr [laughter] you know [laughter] so first of all ... and it's got to be heavy but you do bring up a a good good point is that uh\nThe what you and you bring up is that the or a battery you should have some nationwide coverage right or if I'm leaving here and I'm going to Dallas are ongoing wherever then it's a ... you're going to be covered if I have a ... some batteries that even with the war and you know we'll give out\nMore quickly or what have you batteries cleaners one eight hundred number on it you can read and you can go on your body's gotta cell phone and or find the the closest a\nA facility to get it replaced OK so first of all look for quality by ... the cheapest better right but and that's what we look for when we're getting a vehicle ready for winter or first summer it's not always all about the anniversaries yeah 'cause that's what I see right and it's not all about\nThat we want to you know pressure tests or cooling system and see is going to be holding that good a run some some modes through on a scene\nHater side of it and make sure that he's working\nWell let's see here well I think we'll ever fallen in every ... ... you know it reminds me maybe I should say turn this fall to\nTurn the volume down young ... ... ... don't you have a little switch right there is that word and yeah that's right there okay I see open that up I mean I'm giving you a quick apple phone lesson because see I don't have mine turned down either so I'm going to turn that's all\nI see the orange and okay what do you see the orange you've gotta muted now once you can't do which\nMy wife is famous for doing is when you leave here remembers attorney at the other way you know 'cause I I call her you know later on during the day after she's been to church or the Eastern Star meeting at a keeps going to voicemail keep joined a voice mail and when I finally you know get a caller houses just oh I forgot to serve my phone\nI'm In my second week of this of having a hand me down south of upgraded to use phones yeah [laughter] so hey I'm Glad to share that with your after I've talked to drink there's not many times I get teacher mechanical tricks of Johnny betrayed and\nHe reminded me to turn mine down to [noise]\nAnd I think we've got the studio phone down we are okay I think we're ready to go to hell and if this is one of those mornings a nine Fifteen used drugs five sixty I kill vi but again we were talking about a a batteries in in one of the issues batters get a good quality battery don't try and get the cheapest one oh and also\nI I Know you can go in by battery anywhere and all that good stuff and I can go but it right there all not legal myself but\nBecause the battery fails if this makes sense it isn't always the battery so do I need to consider bringing it into a shop and yet I should just buying another battery and putting it on I'm going to kill that battery to\nWhat you get ... things happen even that are in bad or the charging systems fail and then there's always ask to build a a bad connection\nAnd I'm probably not going to know if the charging system has failed\nRight so I'm now and help you you may not know I I tell you and we just had a fell about a pickup truck in a Thursday said I thought changing the battery out what isn't going to be a big deal and he said now will do is it they want an idol\nWell that's the other side of the things that we got to show me looters that depending on that battery right so when you pull that battery it's sort of like unplugging the computer before you saved your work or you're going to lose\nA vehicles were quick with um Honda's hackers mhm there's fewer models out there that will that if you don't run a back up to keep things POWER UP there and a replacement\nYou lose the security on the on the radio\nAnd they'll never work again unless you have the code to put in it um now yeah most people don't know what they did with the\nCode I was going to say this sounds like a piece of paper I was supposed to keep up\nWith right um what I tell people to do is to take their ashtray out\nAnd take a marker and ride on the back side of that ashtray and put it back in the car\nAnd that way if we you know you just ever happens the simple fix it'd be pull ashtray out punch the numbers back in and\nThe radios working trust me there's not a big market for a radio like that you're worried about it being stolen I don't think it's going to happen most people going to steal a radio is going to be an upper hand ... manager at keeping the code secretly heading for the rest of your life is not a good idea\nAs it were hidden so well it even you can't find it probably not a a good idea and that is one of those issues that are with the way we have all these electronics in cars now with the way they operate\nIn many cases a change in battery even as you get a change you may have just compromise and things and a tenant can I Do so much in trying to save a dollar and change my own battery that I got to bring the vehicle you to be like reprogrammed can I ... and you can you ... you can lose\nThe Internet driving down the road you can already do that with some vehicles you're going to hit the Internet and that's I don't know it's a little frightened away [laughter] ah yeah I ... you can\nIt do you get

hey they're really no\nDumb questions people come in sometimes when they're when they bring a vehicle into shop sometimes they're reluctant to tell you different things or whatever 'cause they think it's going to sound dumb I mean that's going to help you to figure out they're going to talk to me\nYeah yeah yeah those are really they're going to take his time is money other shop as\nAs I don't I don't like what I'm hearing that up on a write down their hand to my technician we got to get a better than theirs because that's where the diagnosing starches that conversation between\nMe and that was in what their complaint is a is to find out when it does and how does what you smell like what's it look like you know\nAll of that how does it over to the weather does it can be very important

the mechanic you figure it out\nYeah but that's not a good way to buy a lottery ticket yeah yeah that's not a good way to give it as much information as possible which means when you're starting to

say hey I got a problem\nIs run and funny and hill up and ask you what are you may funny and get it and drive around the block that that is the best way many times is that you just got to get in\nDr one arrived rocky make it do you guys come up here and show me what you're doing\nIt nearly as we were talking earlier about him porridge medication being clear but it is important to communicate I guess the most frustrating things or the intermittent problems\nThough sometimes you know you can't put put your hand on it or or pinpoint it down and it's you know you can't keep on for three or four days and running errands or whatever trying to get in an ACT UP for you [noise] sometimes it's got to get\nWorse yeah 'cause uh you know I come in and I tell you what it's doing you drive around the block ...\nSafety problem sometimes you know we have to look he's got them let's just got it worse\nGoing to have we're not dedicate my life is you got to be doing it when you come in so that I got to have some kind of a trail or ... or or reason or an explanation to have a starting spot now that doesn't happen often these days I suspect because you got computers now when you do plug into the computer\nIt will sometimes even if it's OK Now it'll tell you it did something back when if it recognizes it oh\nThere's some things that are not recognized by the\nCompany and then you got to wait till the adage you say it just gets worse or start showing how far back as the computer history go on these ... Nineteen\nEighty one and a half and the last when ... when they start out with them in well actually Ford was out earlier than that with with some processors and Chrysler had sent to but I'm\nIndependent wise independent shop was his first type of a scam too that was available was for like an eighty one and a half\nGeneral Motors forged prior to that you had to do some mechanical diagnosing with vacuum pump\nAnd plug in certain things off and what they had called was a breakout box and breakout box you're plugged to process or plugged it in it and you made a big loop and you and all these different holes and you're tested each one of those with our own mater [noise] wow and that was a\nDe da da da da de ... plug in under the dash I usually say and that's it you're plugged in the universal connector on automobiles so that connector no matter the maker model it's going to be the same connect right\nNow you have to have different software computer called ... to Africa universal okay\nAnd then I don't apply to big trucks or anything right let's just put that makes a lot of sense that we don't have any to box full of conductors for ... for the Toyota now there is a connection and this is this is what's going to die okay now how long does the\nComputer in the vehicle uh keep her record is that going to be since day one or do they eventually dumped some of the early stuff well is it\nThis this freshman up every so often you know they'll look after so many engine cycles Dr ability think it will pitch it off into history he you know that doesn't see anymore it'll keep it over history which you can still find I can still find it now wants to clear it out this sculpture while a disconnect into better can\nDo to him and that's where inadvertently you've just clear that he was very against we're talking about earlier about the batteries just important you know when you have a question and that's why we recommend Dwayne over ... ... what do you have a question find a mechanic ... you'll like go to the shop\nWe asked and then um I mean for real estate I Do have a lot of investors that I work with a fine of flip pounds by in a bi rentals we can help go in rehab and put them back on the market or get made made ready for where they can go ahead and rent it\nWe have um homeowners that are refinancing right now that are just like hey I Want to remodel my home in a in a couple of years I plan on selling so we have that going on because interest rates have gone up and so people are rather than buying they're looking at refinancing and then waiting until they really want to purchase again\nWhat are you seeing with that because ah news could be much ado about nothing as the interest rates go up a little still we have these magnificent interest rates\nFor anybody they really are old enough to remember some of the ... days gone by but use that are causing a little disturbing from the forest here are people getting a little nervous or are they more tempted to go out and buy\nA we are seeing a shift in the market and we are seeing buyers be pickier about the home that they are purchasing I mean last year I mean we're in the ... like high threes metaphors interest straight and so you could go and spend a little bit more and feel a bit more comfortable with it\nWhereas now we're getting into the five five and a half even with excellent credit and low income I mean we are seeing that\nAnd um those buyers they're not able to get as much of the house that they were last year and so the sellers are having a look at it from a standpoint out okay Dr reduced down my list so that I can get these viruses so purchase and then so and then that way I mean also for new construction to you\nTypically I mean you're going to pay a lot for higher ... dollar per square foot to get brand new construction and if you're into buyers typically that means you're gonna get less square footage\nAnd so buyers are still wanting that Moore square footage their families are growing people want more space it's not like years ago whenever everyone can be in a thousand square foot house and everyone was fine and people shared bedrooms now every kid gets bedroom\nAnd they went game room they want multiple living rooms large kitchen\nSo square footage of the big deal and so you're not able to get as much square footage now for the price and so people are looking at remodeling their homes and adding on or opening up spaces to get what they want now\nYou bring up a very interesting point to the ... we talked with a ... feeling about our changing\nPattern of what we want a I'm old enough to remember growing up is as a child I share the bedroom with a brother we never thought anything of it uh it was a very small two bedroom house we felt and all of our friends had that\nUh we never really thought we we moved to finally reach your own bedroom still very small house\nPeople today more more real estate the idea even if you have a bedroom with a girl in the bedroom a living room kitchen and budget uh that doesn't really fly anymore does it shows now interest rates go up\nThere is a issue how much how much we're footage Kenya by\nI mean you end up sacrificing updated for more square footage uh that's really what we're seeing right now as you can get more square footage is this year probably an older home that is going to be that isn't a need the updates that you're looking for\nThat you may want to be in a new construction home got you are as similar price basically\nI mean that's a good point in the mail show tie in to coming back to you in wanting some updating John maybe it's even more efficient for me to go in and get that older home would go ahead and talk to you about updating the thing's old updated and have it at square footage\nYes and that's what we can do that kind of where we come off and we look at what the options are what you're willing to pay\nAnd you may be able to go and get the four bedroom twenty five hundred square foot even almost three thousand square foot home for two sixty\nAnd then spend a little bit more and get a remodeled and be able to wrap it into a loan because the equity there and so then that way but I mean if you wanted to go brand new construction getting something that's made twenty five hundred three thousands every American Me well over three hundred thousand\nDollars right now so that is one of those things that again with your two uh\nTwo companies usually side by side with really should in construction and makes a lot of sense because I might come in and get those improvements plus in the construction site you know a lot of tricks to ah make that home\nLook I Want to see more expensive\nMore ornate than it is but you have materials and such that will look like something that may cost less you have some things you can suggestion put it in there and the design phase to give you the contemporary look but not necessarily spending some of the dollars you might have to spend\n... yes I mean there are certain things that really you can go crazy with on the price and everything like that and then we can kind of scale back on other items were really don't have to have a a higher and budget for all those items and then we're also like to offer our uh\nAt cost options as well for different products and\nSoldiers and stuff like there's some way to do it and that's that is certainly we would have talked about a year ago that is interesting that we're beginning to see that I don't think a year ago you would have never thought about does the seller I have to rethink this or do anything usually the seller just tried to kill money\nWas and it was about asking pride civil offers are starting to people were showing up say five ... ... what are the odds of the top of the list\nAnd you know I just frankly uh with the changes this is becoming more the typical real estate market that we've always been accustomed\nIt we if there was an art of artificial inflation that kind of some place due to Harvey and then also due to the extreme lack of inventory the past couple years just because of the plant expansions refineries they've grown they're bringing so many people and and so there was\nLow supply high demand now we're getting more of a supply on hand and then the buyers I mean a lot of people have a brand new house because they remodeled it did Harvey and then they and they didn't move from it and so those people are like well\nScott how I'm pretty much got how I wanted so I don't like or they added an SBA loan on it and so now they're dealing with basically a double mortgage and so they're like I'm gonna have to wait a few years in order to think about selling so that I can recoup everything I Need to do to pay\nOff well and that's another uh excellent point is that if you reduce at home down to the studs and the slab really what you have when you go back if there's electrical updating plumbing updating design updating\nThe or people who are in the home they've always been in and not just that they're like but they have a new home yet it seems like an oxymoron but it's true it is a new home because everything was ... yeah exactly news five sixty kill vi it is ten Seventy\nOr I'll be looking and the most multiple listing service which is what all the realtors we look out for homes that are for

as we talk about\nReal estate market construction remodeling rebuilding\nGigi light bulbs idol that's one of the things you're construction group are you guys are really drinks a small jobs but just you know there are folks who are either busy or should we don't have the time maybe there's some physical limitations maybe they're older\nAnd it may be as simple as installing a door you're willing to do that with ... women do obviously the major work too\nYes and there is no project that as to smaller too large and we were we have scale ability where we can handle all in the end and all the Twain and everything like that\nAnd and I mean there's times whenever I'm dealing with real estate transactions or other realtors or in a real estate transaction and it's like hey we have a leaky faucet ever hear hey we and I'll be like okay you need to call this summer then you take care of you\nOr they're like oh we have some peeling paint just on the eve over here can you please scrape it off painted and to imagine everything 'cause it's an appraisal requirement and so that has no problem with us getting in there and taking care of that and then we can handle all the way up to new construction or even like\nCommercial okay young commercial property we don't talk a lot about that but there's a lot of commercial property\nIn southeast Texas or some of his older that needs to be rehabbed some of the children of your ah but still a that's a big market because we were talking also your little earlier about the uh show much moving in the southeast Texas there's a lot of\nIndustrial expansion that maybe if you've lived here a long time you don't see you don't realize\nJust water oil is coming into south east Texas ... which means people are looking at a commercial property yes and many times that property may have said to him for a while or whatever or they need to adapt it to their huge\nAnd that ... that also is important in time and money to them but it won't affect building dogs so they started doing this\nWhen they need it functioning to where they can work with it and everything like that I mean and if it's not a major major overhaul I mean we can handle certain things in that aspect that we have great referral partners that we can send you off to that will be happy to take care of you and even building a whole new commercial building and everything like\nThat can take care of that actually is urging we're talking about changing home styles\nIcy changes in commercial yeah would you remodel watch or a you know even just building which was remodeled in the late nineties now from a commercial point of view is dated too many officers we don't do as many offers any more there's more open space\nBeautiful eyes you can also help was that was what's the latest in doing the commercials facility so that if you grow and you move to another when somebody will be interested to wonder moving\nYes I mean out when I was getting my interior design degree I was able to go and do an internship around Houston and it was a large architecture and entered design firm and we did doctors' offices lawyers offices and\nA hotel casino spas and then high in residential homes and so\nI was able to really see what it was what practical and then what looks good what clients are looking for what kind of gives that ambience whenever someone a client or a customer walks then do they feel more comfortable with you and the space and then they end they end up trusting you more by coming in and just feeling comfortable\nThat is the up to me is fascinating as I Know I've always others the science behind this and it is amazing in some commercial establishment you go into a doctor's office water and you have a certain feeling\nAnd then you go back in ... and you have this this space is all you don't realize how well utilized it is and uh I've been in some where\nJesus was boxing or we're going to read your other I don't I don't feel very comfortable and you are but but you can't put your finger on it yeah so there's a whole science to designing ... Marshall as well as residential and up\nWe have multiple phone numbers and ... really do but um for if you want to reach me you can give me a\nCall or text me up for zero nine seven eight to ... to zero two and then we also have faced but where I'm the real estate side is Facebook dot com slash told by eighth and then their construction site as Facebook dot com slash build SAT acts as\nA writer yeah usually to reach you and are always a quick to respond that's one of the things about your office is yes quick to respond when you're giving bids on\nThat construction shied remodeling showed you try and get them back\nAs quickly as possible with a couple of days most of the time 'cause that is it'd be frustration with people yes is just not hearing back from somewhere or being on the whole uh not knowing what the project's gonna start seeing the other big frustration we'll talk about the remodeling in in in the construction firm on\nI think another big frustration of lot of people as they show up I mean full force I Am impressed they've pulled up they dropped equipment off they drop material that he got the group going on in their work and their tails off today\nIn or out there tomorrow yet of air tomorrow in your back real five days you go well they're on another project you try and start in finish\nWe try and starting to finish or we get a schedule in place and sometimes where you're ordering materials you have to consider that and then or changes are made and her weight or you're waiting on other trades to earn over ... you know on your way we're going to go to other projects but then as soon as the ... the availability comes back\nOr as soon as them everything and ready to go then we'll be back in there and get and not going to let me know yeah yeah we're we're going to be big on communication and making sure that you're aware of what's going to\nGet the biggest complaint is just a lack of communication that I hear from folks are you do with construction projects is I had to chase them down\nWell even in real estate there'll be like I Can't get a hold of my age I hear that\nToo that's amazing to me since obviously it is a commission oriented business I cannot imagine or not you know not being very response in ... if you're in the real estate business\nBut you're right people I I Do find now we're talking about the changes earlier in size and hold true one such are a lot of changes in society is one of the changes you're seeing maybe with millennials are such this instant gratification yes I Want to talk to Iceland I Want to talk to Iceland\nThat yes and that's where am I has team a team in place where if they can't get me write that second there at least getting someone they can get a van and then they can get an answer or they can get on the schedule with me to her than we can get them taking care of its kinda we've kinda situated a kind of like a doctor's office where you have like the nurses the staff and everything then you have the doctor enough and then\nYou get on the schedule you can't just walk in\nAnd expect to see the doctor right then and there ... there are processes and procedures that we had a ... and they're going to be taken care\nOf doctors there was a time when I was younger you'd call someone a new way to date to hear from them or something he landed voicemail left a voicemail are as old as I Am the role of little faith and then put it in their little slot so they would cheat when they came back from lunch\nBut to tell you it seems like a and they want it now owns a cold or an hour ago I haven't heard back from that office [laughter] I don't know what that all of us is doing yeah all of our\nLike Facebook Messenger we like our response time to be really good texting calling just\nCall back I mean we want to handle that and keep that going and flowing as much as possible\nTo do is when you take care of the problem but yeah but they want to hear from somebody they do they want to hear our want an update also own their project if it's a construction project they want to know where ...\nWhat are we doing I mean we have systems in place that we're working on in order to really fine tune all of that and to really take care of the court\nAll knowing what part of the process you were in\nWe break it up in a phase where we end the faith as and all that\nThere's got to be also a difficult thing where we're facing some some rain here today and\nThere's some good weather obviously from your projects are outdoors yet so you can tell me this will take three days to do that could stretch older two weeks and southeast Texas fan and you just have to communicate and let folks know watch what's going on if if it's a project you can do in the rain and starts raining for four or five days\nI mean and then it still wet or and then you're waiting on the primary writing lately like tradition and then they are getting delayed because their projects are getting delayed and going back to ... and I mean that that has happened I mean since the storm\nA lot of that has leveled out to where we are more available electricians or more available commercial more available\nI mean there is still some backup and the rain does not help with that because I mean we're all trying to get in touch with everyone taking care of as soon as possible\nAnd it's like a degree in some sunshine maybe later this afternoon here tomorrow but that is ... and still wet\nYeah just like the line guy you run into that I mean I don't understand the sun's out now well raining now okay well we have things on the schedule that we've had to go to I mean we're going to change in your yard when they do that we're going to be running up your art and we don't want to do that yeah\nSo that so that is interesting you that it is difficult and again the bottom line is it it jumped out of communications yet is whether you'd only about real estate shattered construction site just letting people do

lot of things people probably think we're we're\nSomewhat and where where where are you going to ... hour 'cause you've talked about so many different things but the truth is you handle these so a little about what you do and how to reach you that\nThey can give us a call or text mat for zero nine seven eight to stick to the era to again we're on Facebook at ... dot com slash told the ace for

remodeled bathrooms kitchen designs Lauren design we have three D. rendering programs where you\nYour house may be at the studs right now and we can get an idea of how you want to rebuild it I'm real estate we do buyers sellers we work with lots of investors as well\nAnd the thing is knowing what the investors formula is finding off market properties all that\nSo you really can do a little of everything we haven't talked a lot about that do you deal with a lot of investors for out of town but there maybe some folks in town to they're wanting to know\nMore about that or maybe they've got some retirement money is and and not giving a whole lot out of it now maybe like take a little part of that say I thought about becoming an investor\nIt is it is more than just going to buy a whole yes and you can help with all those pieces that you need to know to make that intelligent decision of use it is it for you or is it not for you\nKnow it just depends on what you're looking for what your options are I Know of private money lenders harmony lenders I mean credit unions at all her line I mean banks you name it in order for you to get the investment properties whenever you possibly don't believe you can\nAnd you need it but uh when I'm hiring a professional like yourself when I hire a benchmark plumbing you're already either going to be aware of those or he would be the person that would be checking with them if there's any uncertainty\nRight yeah we have we have a working relationship with these guys so we we we deal with them on a daily basis so we understand what they're looking for what what we need to do what needs to happen and they have a tough job they're they're making sure that things are done in a safe manner and because of using the wrong materials are you doing at the wrong way you could you get hurt somebody\nWhen that's something we were talking at the outset here about a third world in in some of the the little old days when you didn't have all of the modern plumbing\n... one of the things I think that a modern plumbing has been responsible for obviously is just a decrease in in disease and such a sanitary shores uh sanitary water supplies and such so it is important it be done\nThe right way it's a our health at stake here we we all live much closer together now\nRight you can do a quick Google Search on a diseases that are that are are modern plumbing codes prevent and it'll blow your mind I mean the kind of stuff that we don't deal with\nSo we don't even think about right\nYet right but or a hundred years ago it was never real problems\nSo again there's a reason for those goes reason for those rules and you will to follow them and of course licensed plumbers are have been trained to do that let's talk about that now you're a license plumber how long it take to be licensed plumber are there different kinds of license plumbers\nSure absolutely when you when you get into the the plumbing trade you have to register with the state of Texas as a license to print as they cost like twenty dollars you get your license in the mail and once you have that license every hour you law working for a plumbing company working under a master Palmer\nGoes towards a your licence and you have to have ten thousand hours before you're even eligible to take a test to become a journeyman plumber which is that usually that's the guy that you see come out to your home is is a journeyman plumber and then above that of course is the master level\nI'm going to be a responsible measuring the state of Texas which is what you have to have\nTo be in business you have to carry a certain amount of insurance there's ton of licensing requirements are education that's where\nThe master a plumber would normally owned the plumbing company Yes sir okay he's going to own the plumbing hamburgers she's going to own the plumbing company journeyman would be the ones that\nCome out but they have had ten thousand our released a minimum a minimum of that one before they're even eligible to take the test and how how much ah how much is ten thousand here a bit ... for years four years old a five year that basically about four to five years to get that uh I guess depending on your work day but\nFour to five years so you know they're not many professions you think about that in the\nPlumbing profession you are studying as long as a schoolteacher or an accountant or anyone else it may be going to a university or college you're spending four years or more I guess to me that master plumber or to be proficient at that trade\nYes or in a periodically I'll go and speak to a high school class and talk to these these guys who don't really want to go uh to to college and uh in this really is a great avenue any sort of trade is because in four years whenever your buddies are graduating from college with a tone a debt\nThey could have a license in their pocket and already making sixty Seventy thousand dollars a\nYear that's an interesting thought too because again you're getting paid while you're accumulating those out there as well so you're not\nPaying to go to school you're basically getting paid to go to school as coordinate yeah that sort of an interesting idea and I've also been told by a lot of the other folks from the show folks are in plumbing\nElectrical work a framing a about anything you could think about in in building a home that one of the problems and obviously you don't fit that bill your young but to one of the problems\nIs that uh it is an older an older\nWorkforce in these construction trades that we are beginning to experience shortages in some of these areas\nTowns shortages I spoke with a guy at the Texas state board of ... one of those things factors just a few months ago and he told me that currently\nThe average age of ... plumbers apprentice and the state of Texas is thirty eight years old\nAnd these are guys learning the trade as thirty eight so I think what we've got going on is we've got this workforce coming out of high school\nBelieving that they need college and they're expecting a you know air conditioned job making six figures and it just doesn't pan out and then they get into their thirties and they think well I Need to learn a trade and that's that's when they start\nSecond though that plumbing looking better they get it's also so again there's a great career opportunities in the plumbing there's training or in plumbing and of course we're here to talk about a a plumbing and what you need to know about it in your house so first of all rest assured when you're calling in plumbing company\nThey're going to be qualified they're going to have a license is that license displayed on your truck or how do I know you're licensed and didn't just show up in the pickup\nIt is the the master license numbers should be despite in at least two inch lettering on that truck so whenever you drop as to service vehicle and you see some random numbers uses a lot of finger well or something like that that is that trades men's license number and you can look it up on line and make sure that that number is valid\nOkay so that's how I Know okay this guy has that ten thousand plus and of course for the time your master plumber and have done this for years\nYou could have thousands and thousands have twenty thousand hours I guess eventually if you're doing this sure absolutely I haven't I haven't calculated up where I'm at now but it's it's quiet you're you're far in excess of ten you're learning every\nLearning every they were to go back and talk about some of those new things to learn and plumbing to news talk five sixty kale vi\n\nFive sixty jail vi has your chance to\nWrite a dripping faucet is one thing but if you have a lake on your gas alone not a

Kaomi ah broadcasting from American standard ... dot com studios\nHere five sixty ... is with us from a benchmark plumbing and if you have twisted that all of right in the wall how do they reach you [laughter] for\nOh not too far snakes a zero eight zero and of course my my website is benchmark\nPlumber dot com that's plumber benchmark plumber ...\nAnd you can check the website out also but when you when you have that sort of sick feeling of hoops\nBecause nobody's happy if there's no water pretty soon they figure out that that means and no toilet and that means we're not going to do this and that no cooking and Everytime water fails it seems to me it fails or when I've been meaning to do the dishes\nOr right after half get to sink full of dishes I Need to uh put something in the washer two where tomorrow and I need to take a bath and that's when the water that's when you lose a you know the water when something happens so again that's the number to call if you\nDo have those problems I'm Talking about that do it yourself projects just being careful ... the other issue too is on many facets I may not want to replace Foss it maybe I just want to replace a washer into our cartridge are we seeing fewer and fewer washers first of all our Foss it's beginning to have\nComponent pieces and it's just a matter of putting another component in\nSure most of your your newer falls is they're going to have cartridges and so back back in the day it was all brass downs with rubber washers and removable seat\nThat's slowly going away and you're seeing plastic and ceramic cartridges and those are generally a specific to a certain style brand and\nEvery couple of years they're changing all over I mean it's it's real tough to get to keep up with\nBut of course we have really good resources because two thousand Eighteen right now so um you can uh you can look online find find what you're looking for or we have a good resource in Beaumont called him Andy supply of see you know he's got to him and they they they keep a\nPlethora of repair parts for false and you could be carrying your falls at your your cartridge or and they can help you identify it and most most likely they are going to have it on their own show\nOr there's some brands of Fawcett you can recommend that I could maybe by with some Bush runs the ten years from now hey Twenty years from now I Would actually that they will be around and they were there may be able to you may be able to find parts for the shirt\nDelta all day a delta is a reliable brand yes or they they haven't changed uh their designs radically I'm In Fifteen Years Twenty years so most hardware stores are gonna carry parts for it it's never hard to find parts to to repair a delta force\nNow while they're not the most expensive around I I suspect they also may not be the cheapest is that also is a problem people fall into you're going through this time and effort to replace a faucet you don't necessarily want to get the absolute cheapest faucet you can find\nNo you don't in Indian people fall into that because\nThen you might not be able to find that part to replace it are the the faucet itself just may not hold up well\nRight right yeah if you go with the with the cheaper false it's a lot of the internal even the body can be plastic and over time it was that starts Lincoln it can wear agrees and the pilot on the internal and he just can't do anything with it except replace it uh in plumbing is just like most anything else you can get what you pay for so\nI had this conversation a law or somebody will tell me a false it as a faucet or Toyotas told him but it really isn't there are big differences\nSo it may will want to hit by a name brand something like a delta and and and I are of a moderately priced one I don't have to have the best one in ... but certainly get a moderately pride when don't try and get the you know I've seen a ... for a as a bath or you can find some of those is\nLike nine Ninety nine or something I'm not sure that I think it would work a week after I put it in\nYou know how how foolish and you're right it's a oh this is awfully light to be oh I see because it's almost it's solid genuine plastic through and through so I Want to go ahead and get something of a quality to last Annan name brand so that if I Do want to attempt to replace that cartridge\nI Can't and also it's good if I'm going to have you do it I assume it's much easier for you if you'd say a name brand Fawcett easier to find those YouTube may have trouble finding\nA real off brand kind of a\nCartridge and then at that point I ended up having to replace the faucet\nRight if you go to a name brand odds are you're service bombers going to have the parts on his truck to repair if it's something in common if it's not just to be relatively easy to get them ... not to mention with a name brand if you have\nA problem within a warranty period or even right outside of emergency period if you go with the the big boys you know your ... and donors American Standards sometimes you can contact to manufacture and they'll send you parts for nothing just\nIf there's a pressure laws on the cold side the hot will compensate remember the old days when somebody flush the toilet while you're taking a shower with scholar you felt it right yeah you knew right away\nWell because of these new designs they are they're taking that out of the equation so hopefully uh that's no longer an issue\nOkay and that's the safety factor too sure I guess for a ... do you have also there are some now that have safety factors may be children you're bailing children or maybe for older adults but it may not have the same feeling or in their extremities they once had that there's different uh safety devices to make sure there's no accidental scalding\nRight these these new cartridges has called guards are on them so uh when they're installed when the cartridge is installed you can talk to your your plumber or you yourself can look it up or talk to the manufacturer\nAnd see what your needs are so if you have small children or elderly in your home you're probably not going to want to be any higher than about one ten one Fifteen and you didn't actually set that they sure can use your can you can open up your self check it with a thermometer\nAnd once you get the right temperature you set this ring on the into your car just now some countries are a little different but usually it's a ring and it just stops it from turn any further\nWhat a safety advice advance I should say what a safety advanced in because that has all been any worry with many\nOf having a small child maybe in the bath tub or or an elderly person are you in the in the tub\nSo that's one thing to do likewise are we seeing sort of the same thing in kitchens and our uh uh the bathrooms with those sinks laboratories and such where it's a one designed to nominate\nYou Yes sir yeah yeah more and more voters are going to that code code you're going to the uh the before we leave the temperature yes let me let me mention one thing just public service here\nOr if your temperature or on your on your water heater if you've got your ... your heaters set above a hundred and thirty degrees it takes less than a second to get third degree burns\nAt a hundred and thirty degrees on your elderly and your children miles so if you if you're one of the people that like to just really cranked your water heater up and get you some good hot water keep that in mind it is it is a danger\n[noise] well and certainly for your a dishwasher or if you're a doing something in the sink it's really not necessary now it's really not necessary and I don't think many of us\nAre going to want to take a shower at that temperature I Know there's a few that may want the super hot stuff but but really if you're just thinking for a closer for dishes it's just not necessary and what you end up doing many times I suspect besides the obvious safety impact is spending extra money\nDid you end up uh again if you have the old fashion if you have the uh the old fashioned Fawcett given up opening the cold to compensate right you're seldom using the water\nAt that yet but you know that's the reason that's the reason people crank up the water heaters\nSo they can use less hot water so they can use more I mean they can they can have it longer for their shout oh I guess what will happen if somebody else start running out of hot water too soon so they'll crank Irvine compensated fixture ever thought of that\nBasically that the water heaters undersized you you don't have a big enough water heater or you need a second one is just compensating by cranking up your heater which in Las ...\nSo just to be safe always think safety or another safety issue that we we were talking a moment ago about a plumbing outside plumbing and that sort of thing and want to use but a lot of us also have sprinkler systems now that's something I assume you don't normally do that's going to be a launch escape or\nA landscaper I should say that it's going to come in and stole that\nBut now it does have to eventually be tied to my ... plumbing how does that work in should I have a plumber actually make that connection\nYes yes the public should be making the connection to the political system now licensed irrigate or can usually those are the guys you're going to use on your sprinklers because honestly they're cheaper measures are a but a license Palmer can install a irrigation\nUh now that connection to the puzzle water does need to be done by license plumber and you need to have a backup or better\nI was gonna say what's the difference here I just took the ... bike and hook the plumbing up but that's not safe ...\nNow you can see driving the subdivision is driving through your neighborhood on the side of these on the side of your homes you're seeing the water line come up out of the ground and there's a brass about with the little canopy on top of it like a mushroom yeah and then it dropped right back down on the ground\nThat is your back flip prevention for your sprinklers and\nPeople get kind of aggravated about 'em because you have to test them annually\nUh in during freezes when we do have cold water which is very rare right a ... that's the first thing to break because it's exposed the air it's up above grade so you have to cover so you have to cover you have to put something over to protect it from the from the cold\nBut it is a very much needed\nI'm simply that's on the system because you're putting pesticides you're putting fertilizer you putting all sorts of stuff in your on your lawn and those those sprinkler heads whenever they're disengaged they drop down below grade so the possibility exists if there's a pressure loss on the main\nDay 'cause I and that stuff right into your drink of water so that that assembly it may be a pain but it is very needed\nAnd that's the real reason you have any pressure drop\nIn and don't think you will we've had it not only on small systems you here is so small a municipal systems having issues here and there we've had issues in the cities will certainly in Beaumont into a ... year we've had pressure issues so it can happen anywhere if my pressure drops you would actually just sucks that a\nBad water potentially contaminated stuff right into\nMy ah hold water supply route of the ... the ... flu perimeter is going to stop it well worth doing and I assume it's also one of those things are going to have\nBy code Oh yes it's ... it it's illegal not to have it you're supposed to have it so in that would be something a plumber should make that actual\nFinal physical connection in and make sure right and then the testing on those assemblies or a that's done by a completely different life is hard to keep up with a lot of lumber to tell you exactly okay if\nWe do a lot of almost out of time would quickly we obviously a ... cold weather in the winter when a lot of hot weather in the suburbs or anything you mentioned the protecting the back flow devices and such\nWe don't get many freezes when we do have a freeze a covered the pipes and exposed plumbing we don't have the amount of exposed plumbing we used to have some of the older homes do is that a case where when\nIt's not cold you ought to make sure pipes are wrapped with insulation do you ... your coverage with to make sure you\nDon't have a problem when the south in southeast Texas if you protect it from the wind\nUsually that's all you know we have an extended stretch of super cold ... weather then you definitely want to a rapid real well if you if you don't have all the fancy stuff that they're selling at the hardware stores now\nYou can wrap your your husband's just with a you know an old shirt or a towel and hotel and then put some plastic or because when we get those fronts usually it's preceded with right now so if your towel or your shirt or whatever it is you're rapping the assembly was that gets wet\nAnd then phrases will usually have a big ice ice cubes they're so\nWhy do you want to put your wrap it real tight with something\nAh and then put your plastic over it and then you should be fine so it doesn't have to become playing right now there is something uh to on the same in the same vein titles ... a lot of them are going outside a lot of people are choosing to install those on the outside of their home\nA now during freezing temperatures it can really wreak havoc on those you know you had to do some different things with those to protect those are from the freezing weather\nMy advice on that is called a plumber on that one so because if you cover the whole thing you can have some issues because they do exhaust you don't want to trap that is awesome and then you as far as\n... ... five sixty tail vi he thinks for being with us today and once you get how do they reach a forum on two four six eight zero eight zero or benchmark plumber dot com\n[noise]\nHi this is Roy west of the royal ... real estate showed joined me every Sunday from New new one on loose talk five sixty kale vi well coming up next it's Fox News\nOn the weather in sports for South Texas online and on the air news on five sixty five home I I hardly\nDissecting Saudi Arabia story I'm Pam who sounds Fox News\nI'm dumber one I'm not going to slip that passed you guys I guess a of the obviously they're going to there's some database that somebody's going to know that this person in the household turn sixteen or or has a driver's license I should say\nYes a there is a thing there's a report that goes out for all register drivers at addresses to where those people can some insurance carriers automatically add them without the knowledge of the of the ... as a person is paying for the policy and we don't want that to happen\nA so anytime that you do have a young driver or a driver moving out to where you need to take them off or add them\nLetting us know as soon as possible as best\nNow you said moving out how does that work so they're moving out to get their own apart but perhaps a\nWhole no longer register drivers that address and uh at certain ages you know like for men you know we get discounts and Twenty one twenty five and even thirty were when I get them a little bit earlier than that but there's a lot of\nYou know ah families out there that stay on their parents' insurance so they're twenty five or until they move out to where they're no longer register driver at that address they moved out and uh they're living somewhere else so they can get their own policy\nOkay so now do they have to do that here they showed her parents' policy absolutely no case and that's what I was thinking but in most cases is usually when they move out and their own their own or they're going to want to uh to have their own policy also how does he work when we were talking about the driver has turned\nA sixteen or I guess is it is sixteen or Fifteen maybe to be able to drive with an adult in the vehicle you still\nHave to have them injured but uh the\nBeing insured you have to have a valid driver's license okay a learners permit or any of those things you've got to have a driver's license to be insured\nHis own learners permit considered a driver's license\nOr ... as long as it has the the ID on it a way yes\nSo now I'm going to teach the youngster how to drive or or the youngster is going to began to sixteen and they have their license and they're going to drive we have several cars\nDoes that mean they can drive any of them should I Choose your car they're going to drive I here of course a lot of folks and I know you probably get this in your office saying okay I'm going to buy the older car or whatever that I'm only going to have\nLiability on or whatever from the perspective as in of an insurance agent what's the best plan or what do you recommend\nWell every carriers different carriers it would ever vehicle you touched they want you listed as a driver on\nWith all state we have a thing called a note named insured meaning that you do not have to be listed driver on every single vehicle as long as you have permission by the primary carrier you're covered under that vehicle and under that policy\nA so every carrier out there is different so you want to double check talk to your area or talk to your area or are you have a say your brother in law moves into your house or your are your in your nephew make sure that they are covered if they do drive your vehicles cars are are carries out there to where they will not be covered\nIf they're not listed on the policy like some carriers they are\nYou know what I'm thinking about the teenagers driving but that's an excellent point I didn't realize that because many August hey it's Thanksgiving and then everybody is visiting and you get the cars are all blocked ... say here's the key is to my car go down and pick this up\nThey may not be covered I Need to know from my insurance agent so how does that you know how's the coverage working as anybody gets in the vehicle cover and only certain people so that's a question for your agent absolutely and I mean in a\nTime like now with the holidays coming up where there's going to be a lot of family there's gonna be a lot of people in the home you know ah there's more susceptible to claims you know you're going to be a lot of cooking a lot of you know like you said cars everywhere so\nPeople forget you know the hazards in the insurance risks that come with the holidays and and now is the best time to actually call and ask those questions because every carrier is different or not one has the same now we do our coverage is are the same but as far as how the policy is structured\nAre different so yeah right now would be the great time to call your carrier ask those questions on who's covered who's not covered in the event or that somebody needs to drive my vehicle\nWell and I will tell you rushed you that's a great point because I think a lot of people simply don't understand that you probably get people in your office were shocked maybe it's subject is or isn't covered you people have changed of companies\nAnd don't realize and assume that again because we know it's all regulated by the state there's this general assumption out there we would all must be the same not exactly\nNot exactly a lot of your coverage is you have your standard coverage is that every company will cover but certainly there are certain companies out there that uh\nHave coverage is that comes standard on the policy and some ... companies you have to have an endorsement written to add those coverage just to the policy\nKind of like water backup or residents glass or identity theft and stuff like that uh where you know if you didn't know that that wasn't on there a lot of people don't know what's excluded from the policy they only know what they're covered for\nWell and then again underscores I think the importance of having a local insurance agent uh I'm not sure I Want to talk to a reptile\nI'm a a a a local agent who can explain these things to me because I don't know you know I as as with most people would probably come into your office I Know very little about insurance\nAnd sometimes sadly we rely on what our friend told us about their policy are you know my cousins brothers experience and I'm not really sure what I've got so I Need to talk to my agent about my specific policy in company in\nWhat they cover and absolutely and there's nothing against a you know those ... those agencies where it's a one eight hundred number yes building the report and building a relationship with somebody a face to face and one on one is great and the ... all state we have for service that work around the clock I mean we're open right now from tend to three actually just got a text from
