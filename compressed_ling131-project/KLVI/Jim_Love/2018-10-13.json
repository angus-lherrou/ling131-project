{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "The risk factor or that you might have and which is why we talk show heavily about just trying to exercise and eat right and again over the years I've tried to prescribe less medication to patients\nJust because I just sometimes feel like patience is way way over medicated and if they could just get out and exercise a little bit and eat better\nThat they can get off these medicines which I Try to mention a lot about your food is medicine like these vegetables and these fresh fruit you know getting some kale and you die every day some tomatoes and cucumbers\nUm some fresh fruit like apple of hair\nI mean it just it's it's it's the stuff that you need to make your body feel better than function better it's just starving for that sort of thing which is the exact opposite and when you kind of loaded down on you know just rice and bread and\nFried this and fried that and sugary beverages and biscuits and gravy and\nI mean like where's the nutrition and all of that and what are you doing to make your body feel bad I mean just look at the plate is helping me are hurting me and if it's not then why you eating it all the time you 'cause\nI mean again most patients when it comes to the office\nYou know they want to feel good tired they don't have that energy that vigor that they once had and you know they're looking for something to make them feel better and you know it's a lot of times I Know they don't want to hear what I have to say [laughter] and then I say yeah now you're\nGot to do this you gotta do that and just\nGod can you just give me something like really quick and easy that can just go to the pharmacy and take it and just just evaporates all this stuff but I can you know I cannot I can get away with not exercising I can still drinking a beer and\nI can still have my doughnuts I mean do you have something like that I don't know doctor will ever have that know infomercial ever have that\nThat does not exist\nJust that's not how the body works where you can take one thing one tablet one neutral suit Ikle that\nYou know some somebody promised you if you take this group of pills tablets vitamins that it's going to magically erase everything else that you're not doing and I again I I kind of suck all when patients come to the office\nAnd you know they are and and that would be I'm curious about that like why is it easier to believe in that\nAnd and not really what is the truth because it seems we're easily tricked and led to believe that yes the solution is sprayed this\nThese neutral pseudo goals to supplement that my friends told me about that I saw on TV and she took it and now she's amazing and you know why we keep falling for that I I don't understand that while we will we will spin a lot of money on these supplements and these things\nThinking that it's going to help us but the infant made this study's in their their research is not there again I mentioned to you that researching health is very expensive [noise] it takes a long time\nAnd most businesses that are putting these products on the market they don't have to do this study's because of how the laws are regulated\nAnd they kind of have some freedom in and saying what they want to say what the packaging and especially on the Internet what they can say\nSo there's a lot of false it's out there when it comes to this this information and I'm just trying to get you understand that that stuff never ate it just doesn't exist you got to understand the basics of health that's never going to change you have to exercise you have to eat right\nPeriod if you want to feel better if you have high blood pressure you have diabetes you have cardiovascular disease your body needs the proper nutrients and proper fuel\nTo function is no different from a car so different from your house it's no different from anything else so I always try to import patients to\nDon't fool yourself don't fall into this habit of thinking that this is kind of work 'cause it's not going to work invest into your own health you get a blood pressure machine get a blood chicken machine\nGo to the store and buy those expensive fruits and vegetables because again if you're unhealthy\nIt's gonna be two or three times more expensive buying medicines come into the doctor's office getting admitted to the hospital can't work now you've got to go on FM LA you got to retire you got to go on disability\nThat's more expensive than going to the produce section getting some fresh fruit getting uh vegetables cooking yourself\nYou got to be much better and pay less in the long run anyway I'm allowed to open a non six scale vi winning hundred three three zero Kelvin I'll be back in two minutes\n[noise] what are

I've never quite figured out the change\nIs not is not cheaper it's actually is it more I Know it's not one stop shopping anymore you know it's it I used to go get everything right there and you stick around five yet oh now you've got to go get inspection take your receipt go down the court house yeah turn that and pay the rest of the money gets its sticker\nWill it of course in my case I have to go to Buner which is the nearest sub courthouse for me to get it and ah it's hard for me to go away and give up your Jasper urine even those Jasper Jasper ... hard no it's a it's it's Jasper aside go you're going to be able to\nAnd they've got a nice little lady in there and I don't blame her but she's going to be shutting that door had for twenty nine fifty eight or so you get there and that was ... yeah\nBe a mile down the road you'd you'd be walking human are begging not even a bus and yeah it's good to be we're out of years ago a young age that very convenient for those of us it's other Jasper ... it and really uh I guess in Jefferson County you have to go to the\nDowntown there over in ... county mentality of you live in ... if you offer that it would offer so uh again don't don't wait till the last minute because that's the end of the unit but on the line if you've waited as a last minute well you did it again\nYou might go to get that inspection and they may do you need breaks or\nYou need a composite light put in because this one is so far up a crack at it there's the light coming out of it is hardly visible and which means now you've got to go find a shot it worked in get that done\nGo back and have it reject\nWill it in all seriousness you know to do that on your lunch have waited for the last minute to a new may be driving the vehicle around a with a a outdated sticker while you're trying to get that done\nThat's not going to play well if you are pulled over say well I'm working on it yeah sure so you start earlier in your head a month to work on endlessly Asian and I'm as guilty I've got one billion of October I got to do and here it is Thirteen but\nBut I may choose to take some of that savings and invest in some other things in that home right at that get goes it's being built that many otherwise not be able to afford soup it truly does become a dream home\nShops swimming pools a lotta times people take the savings that they that they made on building their home and they just added into additional ... a ... amenities as they put in maybe a a a outdoor kitchen on that swimming pool or both\nOr fences um you know shot buildings whatever is on there a bucket list to do and it's just a great way to to build your home\nAnd it just it it makes really when you talk about the program and it makes so much sense in many people have never thought about this before or or if they thought about building their own home they're real hell I how do I get financing I don't know anything about it where to find contractors or\nHow it's all very baffling process\nYou guys are professionals not only in the financing\nBut in this whole process you've got this ... you've done this hundreds of times\nYeah and and you know it isn't it is not for everybody the first thing is not everyone needs to be their own contractor we try to look at that up front\nUm and we've actually discouraged some people from uh from from going through the your own builder program because we just didn't think it was the right fit\nLet me ask you if you look for is what makes a person suitable for beyond builder how would I Know what are some key indicators that I Would do hey this is for me\nIf you've always wanted to build a home and just been afraid to do it you didn't do it because of of the fear involved in building a home you aren't going to be a great be your own builder\nThe people who um\nYou know when they come in they just don't have the time they don't have the they don't have the um we kind of try to ask them a series of questions that I'm not going to go into right now to kind of determine whether or not this person is going to be is going to be somebody who's going to um\nBe able to handle this process\nNow most of the time\nI'm we find out that most of the people who come see us have always had a desire to do and and I've always wanted to to build their own home that this has been something that that they've been thinking about a long time they just didn't know how to do it\nWe can help those people those people we can we can work with\nThe other thing that we also have to look at is a financing um we do this or a lot so one of the first things we do is we get your pre qualified so we make sure that you can get the financing for this there are people who come to us that would love to do it\nBut just don't have the ... uh they've had they've had bumps in the road or issues years passed and they're just not in a point yet where they can do it and we were going to tell you that as well\nUm I have that conversation almost weekly with someone they'll come in and and we'll look at 'em and say look here's the issues that we see with your financing and so forth this is going to be a problem we can get you financed for a home loan\nOr that some other ... other business and uh we can get you finance for a home loan but we can't get you financed or to build your own home\nSo they may be of a few differences in the requirements or whatever is absolutely maybe not every body number what you've got to got to be able to be financed right uh and\nThen you you have you had to have the credit strength to be able to be financed um and sometimes people can get financed to purchase a home that's a whole different situation than to build one got banks that\nDo the interim construction loan nearly all require a high credit scores or nearly all of them require a minimum six eighty and most of them are wanting seven or seven twenty credit scores depending on how much you need to borrow\nAnd then again I should have had that desire that I've sort of always wanted to do this or what about a time and obviously this is probably going to end up being a family project so yes I assume husband and wife need to be seen on the same pay\nIt's best if everybody is on the same page and they're all excited about doing this a husband and wife and even children if they're older children really need to be involved in the process um\nAnd ... we just have a great way to look at this and make sure that that everybody's going to be a good fit for the program before we get before we get you involved in in it\nAnd that's part of I I think what makes the beer on a builder program so wonderful is is you are you care about the people you care about the people are going to be in the program\nYou want people to be successful in in your folks to be your own builder program are successful because of a of of you guys should professionalism your care you've got a great manual but you're you're selective you're going to talk to people and make sure this is for them\nYeah and let's talk about that a little bit ... with beer\nThe older you don't just to get a manual and say here's your instruction book go build your house you have consultation available all the time in a way to and we prefer you to call\nAnytime you have a question we like you to call I mean it's great with us if you call every week or even every day a week for for that\nThen to you to go for two three four weeks maybe have a problem and let it build into till it's a major problem we we want if you have issues or if you need questions asked or answered we want you to call us right then and we get we get right back to you\nWell and I guess in some cases to with this is a construction project if I may have a problem or a question if I don't call you it may have either be too late or extremely difficult to change that I should have called you the moment I said oh I've got a question\nAbout it it can be most of the time that people who have an issue sits with subcontractors with suppliers are with something that that that is really a out of their control and sometimes it's out of our control\nYou know and we had a lot of questions during and during a Harvey because a lot of things got really slow a sub contractors everyone was it was a mess for a while sure but it was that way with people who built a hundred homes a year or two I mean everybody was\nHaving issues such as call in talk it out and they don't let things get less not let let's not\nLet an issue billed to where it's uncomfortable for anybody we want you to call every day you're you're also going to be assigned a consultant and you are free to call her every single day if you need to\nDo if I've got a question just call and that may be a mechanical question at that time I made us wonder okay I noticed there doing this is a why are they doing this how is it has to be\nDrawn on your phone and send it to us we'll look at it or say that's there's nothing wrong with that so war yes that's a problem we need to get we need to get a we need to get that frame or back or we need to get that sheet rock God back or whoever whatever the issue is\nSo beyond builder is really sort of your own contractor but I'm never alone and it's I have somebody to call anytime right and again you've got some written guidelines sagging look through also ... that I've got somebody I can call any time and say got a question\nAnd Jim there's something else be your own builder works different than some of the other programs that are out there that are similar there's other there's other build your own home a a groups out there that work differently [noise]\nMost all of all of the be your own builder type I'm a tag along groups ... nearly all of them require you to use their suppliers\nAnd their subcontractors\nAnd what you have to ask yourself about on that is if if I have to use your subcontractors and I have to use your suppliers\nWhat how much are you what how much is is that company earning off of those subcontractors ... and the suppliers are are there any kickback\n... making a little money\nThey'd be making some money on it we don't require a single solitary or we don't require you to use a single person on our list as a supplier or as a subcontractor we\nGet no kickbacks from any of our suppliers or we don't even get a I haven't ever even had a free lunch for many of these people\nWe just do business on a regular basis these are the same people the same subcontractors we use in our custom home building and um\nSo we supplied those people to you if you use them it's great if you have a problem with one of them\nAnd we can usually get it resolved\nWell that's the other thing I appreciate about beer on builder and of course\nI don't know how you get your day done because you have so many different different things you do it ... the last few weeks at a ... you also are a home builder says that means when I'm Talking with you what I'm Talking with the beer on builders staff\nOver the years and it has just grown we've we've grown we've had a few setbacks during the mortgage meltdown and so forth but

home and really it will be a dream home if you are if you're the uh basically uh your own contractor putting things in it maybe\nA saving money no doubt maybe reinvest in some of that money in choosing the minute geez it otherwise you could not have a in that home Chris Wade is here to explain that in more and always available to answer your questions or off the air anytime you goodbye visit or\nGive a Christian call in and talk about this as you said at the beginning of the show\nNot for everybody but the folks that it is for and there have been hundreds of hundreds in southeast Texas many of them come back and do it again in the rye and they've they've had so much fun and it is a project that I like to say and I know you guys are reluctant to say it because\nThere's always that possibility but I like to say it's impossible to fail was be your own builder I mean if you you do the few simple things and you're you're you got the\nFolks available on the phone a twenty four seven I got a great manual it's going to show you what you need to do great subs how can you say\nIt's very difficult to uh if you can balance a checkbook you can you can do this program and you can build a home and have a great home when you get finished with it [noise]\nUm we have um we have been a hundred percent say we have a hundred percent success rate so anyone who goes through our program is actually going to build their home and have a great and I have a great home when they get finished with it\nNow I always like to emphasize the fact you never have to pick up a hammer you're basically serving as a contractor here but if by chance you have a particular skill maybe you're a licensed electrician licensed plumber maybe your cabinet maker or something for ... guy guy\nOr a or a ... a framer you can do you can do that can do some work yourself if you choose to if you have skills in any of these areas you can do it we've had some very successful very successful\nOr people who've gone through our program who've done their own trim their own cabinet we've had people who've done their own electrical work and some of them moved on their own painting and uh one of one of the gas that went through the program I told him at the time I said you know painting the hardest job in a\nIn the whole deal and he said well he said I think I'm going to try tackling it it's a man I said that's that's the one job I probably wouldn't tackle it but I ... what you want to do he got the right equipment he did a great job and now he's building houses for people willing\nI have no skills at all I can get the family together and I can probably help on the clean up if I Want to do that and save some money\nThat's right I'm a Tracy saved over a hundred thousand dollars building her house and uh she's uh she's going to be your building consultant if you go through the bureau builder program but Tracey I'm [noise]\nUm she did that was the only thing that she didn't she liked uh she liked to do the clean up and she was a ... year she built in an area where you can burn and she she did all of her own clean up but um I I can tell you this\nUh the clean up didn't save or a hundred thousand dollars it probably saved her three or four so hit again I was the program that was it was the other things in the program and her ability to shop for what goes into her house that saved for the big bucks\nAnd you just said something very interesting there Chris because I think ah when I'm dealing with a a builder or a contractor I I'm going to go and I have to make some selections and such and they're going to call me probably at the time I most inconvenient Jack Ryan got to go a select these things\nBut as a person in the beer on builder program certainly I can ... your your places I can go shop someplace else\nAbsolutely would I be free to really just look around maybe I see some scratching dance in Houston or whatever and I want to go get a range that nobody has ever get to see the scratch or exactly\nOr I'm going to tell you that that the people who have done the best with this program\nHave been the ones who shocked the best a lotta people uh we've had numerous people go to Houston or go to Louisiana and find everything from their brick\n... to a ... and ... by all means we have local brick yard is that we normally send people to but we've had people that have gone in and said and done some shopping on their own and I've come up with incredible deals\nWell then again if I'm okay with it I'm basically serving as my own contractor here if I don't mind maybe I'm going to find a closed out or something that maybe a contractor as a country in general not get a deal where you can go down\nYou go to foreign places and all we've had people that have gone to Houston\nThey found and they've they've found Trevor team tile or something else that was a was a at the time was one of the exotic uh Adams and they've picked it up for pennies on the dollar compared to what\nA what they could get it for here locally Santa ... problem doing that if you can find it and you can put it in a you know if you can find it you can bring it back in and we've got installers that can install that stuff for you\nAnd again you've got a great list of subs and as a builder yourself I have more confidence though I Know I couldn't go find anybody I Want and maybe I have friends in certain fields but you obviously employ these folks to build a some of your ah houses and such\nIf I just find somebody in the yellow pages I'm just one person did I define you however uh if if things aren't quite always writer I Want to ask you a question or I Want a little extra attention to detail\nThey're probably going to be more likely to give it Jim ... again you they are on the air on builder list\nThat's it that's absolutely correct and we use we use a lot of a local people and when we build a house I can tell you right now when we build a house we may go in and we we go into our local um a counter top a floor covering place and we pick out all of our selections we make our selections right there\nAnd they give us a good price uh but I don't know but what we couldn't find it cheaper if we had more time to go searching and shopping and that's that's why I said the people who have done the best in our program have been the ones who've been the best shoppers\nAgain as my own builder or I can do shop time if I Want to do that don't have to but if I Want to do that right ah I can probably uh go to Houston go different places looking ...\nThey become perfect ... year old builder wants to emerge as again they're going to on their own home\nAnd they want to own it outside of an age away so they don't have to worry about that and they're gonna they found them a piece of land to to buying or they've already bought a piece of land that may be a little outside of the city limits or whatever\nAnd ... that's a number of our of our ... year old ... customers are building on those types of properties and they have to have well water wells and a half half septic systems they're somewhat off grid and again\nThis fits right into what you're doing in right with the money is you're saving maybe in the past having a builder come in and build at home they still have to come up with the money for all this other money they're saving they can put that well in that show our system it made us generator if they want\nThat's true uh there's a lot of people who do that and we put in\nWe build a lot of houses in areas where uh where you need a water well mhm where where you need a I'm a septic system and then a lot of people are adding the generators now generators have become very popular just because you you\nKnow our recent experience is over the last decade as right and then and then all what\nThe other thing is is a lot of these places don't have gas service so they're having to get a either rental tanks or purchase a tank and either bury it or put it you know in the back yard for their propane\nSo banned her ... year old building these are all\nThings that we handle every day and we can help you with which\nBy the way and then I think that's the exciting I think it's very exciting what you do less somebody think the beer on builder program now if I happen to do I have a lot in the west into bull botch absolute I could do that to ... I think many of the people\nIn your nose grammar looking to be in a more rural area yeah some of them are this works anywhere\nWe've done um in Beaumont neither Lin we've done them all over I mean orange you name it we've done I'm at the beach you can do you look at here is a great market yeah and the beach markets are great market or you can do 'em at the beach you can do um just almost anywhere\nAnd Jay lakes lakes like houses we've done Sam Rayburn we've done\nUm we've done a judge elite also Toledo a band that we've done a Sam Rayburn and we've done I'm the one uh conrail light on roe\nSo you will actually go out a little that direction now she's a great developments going on to the con row area and\nWe have we have people it probably almost anyone in Texas and are listening area we can help\nNow we do not have as many sub contractors and suppliers in some of the further out reaches but we can still help you with your own builder program and uh we do it at a a discounted rate for people but where where we do\nOr where we're just a consultant so you're available really anywhere in just anywhere in the state of Texas\nTen fifty three new show on five sixty kale vi\nWhen your banquet community bank of Texas you experienced all the things you want from a business bank and none of the things you don't hear you get guidance not grief you enjoy a culture of follow through not full through the cracks because we're committed to holding our into not holding you back\nThat community bank of Texas we do these things because we want your business to succeed not suffering community bank of Texas business banking better back and remember FDIC equal housing lender do online\nStandard there in\nMiller the summer than ...

we now in charge [laughter] way we do to jog but yeah I I think it is true that is very relaxing for a lot of people I think the frustration comes in and that's another good reason I'm so glad you're

August\nEarly September is the which in our ... that's the way everything can go wrong ... start showing up OK yeah brown patch shows uh sometimes we uh like last two years ago we had solved Web worm that showed a\n[noise] and see that's the time many of us think yeah I can relax now it's all over I've gotten through summer\nNow that we're always in the lawn and garden business we know that in that time of year it's just everything goes wrong and people are and it's a shame because they're so there's for lack of a better word for it's a lot of people well\nYou have to go to a place to that dispense is really good information\nAnd that is a problem and I certainly don't mean to to put down in any one and there are a lot of great places and I think we all probably go to a box stores now and then we all go to various places but it is hard to the information\nA lot you know they don't live and they don't live in the long gone because like I Do\nKnow and I think ah you know you have some a local nurseries you have some local business is of which stock your product you very careful about who you select us stock your products that have\nSome knowledge you know and and that sort of step number one uh is is to talk to people know what they're doing\nYeah we'll go ahead I've got a I have a cookout their won all five he does a pretty good job of uh just about all of the Yemen\nDe supply stores they they go to ... ... in fact they come every year they come to our day a burning okay huh I'm Bomani greenery there are Ginny over there she's been there for gosh she ... maybe ... fourteen Fifteen Years\nStarted when she was twelve oh I better keep us out of [laughter] but today yes indeed\nYeah and farmers mercantile over there a bubba Harris He's very knowledgeable you just an old family and then there for many years\nA lot of change the problem I have with farmers market ... is I Can't get out of their uh you can go in and uh it is worth to you know that they actually are in our engine that's in an old part of orange downright orange\nTheir tour groups that stop there because of his I mean it is like stepping back in time I heard you go in there so that's a great place to good selection there it is and you've got others\nYeah yeah I have a free ... and ... southern nursery in ... the\nThat's one of my favorites I that's that's a\nFairly close to where I live side go in there and ask all my stupid questions there they've got they keep a full line is they've got a full line of stuff and they're very knowledgeable and they don't laugh when I asked you know that this may be a stupid question by now they take me the other hand if you were the product and say by this yet\nOn yes yeah very good a good good guys oh yeah so you ...\nYou have a lot of uh of ... nurseries and that's what you really need a that's what you need to know yeah what you need to get because he ends we were just saying a lot of pride in ... you were talking about\nFarmers market into ... have you ever been over to a sensors hardware and neater yes yes yes I mean that's just to know the you know it's an old building on the side of the rare hide their ...\nUh they won the uh ... I guess a couple of years the chamber of commerce or you know a a word their business and they do an excellent job Judy gray there\nYeah I'll tell you what's fun about that you can imagine in that business back in the I guess twenties thirties forties probably the train stopped there\nBecause you you don't want to coming back ever show you use this to kill it then put the very late yeah seal it out OK\nOkay so again that's important to know and and that's a good thing that you get something that's a price competitive now making it more affordable it's eleven forty eight new talking five sixty kale vi this is Jean\nValor Randy from that's the bottom line Todd ... minute I bring that to you each Saturday from six AM to seven AM and Sundays from eleven twelve right here on five sixty K. L. the guy\nA guy who gets you know Michael berry show we said five on news talk five sixty kale vi\nIt's eleven fifty one news talk five sixty kill me I\nDan Snyder from ...\nUh with us today as we enter our final segment here\nAnd the by the way Troy pretty from the ground up is Kevin go next talk about ... inspections but again we're talking right now it doesn't take a home inspector and to see if the grass is dead or not we know what do you put the home up for sale or just wouldn't neighbors go by as you said earlier I think there's a certain amount of pride Dan\nIn having a nice yard\n... and it doesn't happen by chance\nNow though I often get a little frustrated when you drive by the home that's been abandoned for two years and they've got the law but for most of us that's not going to happen you're going to have to fertilize and treat the lime yeah and you're gonna have to follow a regular schedule\nYes sir and I'll be I'll be passing them out over Timothy this afternoon\nAnd I'll tell you these are great schedules I was teasing earlier but even as a failure of the bag so yeah free and you just know exactly okay get this at this time right at this at this time ... and you are a good to go now what do you recommend a spreading a these materials with\nWell earth way has a good spread or they'll get shaping company has got uh some really good spreaders now I'm\nAn hour the enemy to adjust like when I take your ... bag and pour it in there is going to be easy for me to figure out a setting\nNo no no\nNo no no no no we we are\nWell that to answer your question we well let's take like imperial on food are most one use on the schedule is riding five ten\nUm since about\nI mean we have eleven spread or settings on that my aunt and almost today they're they're we read did it about a three years ago and\nAlmost all of them are obsolete wow we can do more get a plate finished in while these and they had changed it yeah so better\nTo stick with a a name brand some of these you named to the name brands\nYeah well you but you can get a Scott's or a ... or a earth way split or you can find them at ... supply\nFarmers mercantile or ... or any any ... southern nursery any of them they'll have spread or\nYeah and uh but anyway there the\nSettings or on our by so just follow what's on a bat and just try to do that okay yeah so and the and again probably better to buy if you can can\nI'd say by quality spread her yeah because I've noticed some of those cheap ones are it's just they don't last long they're difficult to use some of them to push\nWill the shape and actually for a this is the second year for shape and we carry the those and they've they've come out with a really good spread or we went through a period there\nWhen they only spread or we could get was either a Scott's or go Scott's both the republic to company down in Mexico and so you either had to get a Scott's or ... or earth why wasn't real widely available and they were real expensive to ... and uh you\nDidn't get much for your money but I think shape and has a really good product in a good spread or\nI'm gay and again should be able to get to those in southeast Texas at a gas most places\nYeah yeah I think most most places certainly the uh the farm stores the hardware store you know\nAre going to have the in the ... going to have the shaping so get a good spread or and or anything in particular in taking care of that spread or do I need to rent it off when I fish are one bag it through a\nFertilized and be sure and rent it out mhm yeah ... uh they're they're a heavy a plastic ... um hopper so it's not metal and it's not going to roast\nJust rent it out some of the framing that are you better wash at all no kid and then just I'm I'm ready for the next go around then yeah and how often again I'm going to be doing this fall just to recap what should I be doing right now\nRight now you need to be putting ego fun just side on your on any spots that you have\nPut the fall special a winter ... six team\nThat covers a forty pound bag will cover about six thousand square feet and then at the end be certain the most one of the most important things you do you got to put out your barricade pre emergent herbicide so you can hit all the weeds that will come typically come in February and march\nBut I'm putting that out on putting the barricade out now\nYes and if you put barricade out for two or three years you may not need to put it out anymore\nYeah man\nYeah it's it really does that seals the ground\nNow how often do I put do I have to wait a period of time between putting these out\nTo a ... you know if\nYou can put them out right now or if I had a brown patch or a path engine that was appearing right now I may not want to run and spread or through it or or actually I wouldn't for laws that area yeah uh where you have a path engine\nOkay so I Want to take care of that first yeah you need to put fungicides down on it okay and but then as far as putting these different uh bags of different things out I can do that just same day in the same day okay the same day and uh how ... how dry\nVisit 'em you're not going to activate the fertilizer or the barricade or the ego fungicides until you get some moisture\nWhich in our case is usually about ten minutes from now so uh but it also should be dry enough to put it out so uh uh I don't want to put it out on just super wet ground or anything to\nNo um no you can put it out on real real wet ground\nSo destroyed put it out hopefully rein in the next day or so and they ordered in our water it in even one okay and the sprinkler system just\nFlip it on get get some water going Yes sir okay doesn't sound hard the way you explain it will sounds pretty easy to me and this would protect by law not only this fall you know Charles you got to\nMake it even better next spring yes or if I'm On our schedule and if you look on our website at ... dot com again what's the website I think it's ... dot com okay and you go on a very\n[laughter] you're are you you don't have to go to it very often no uh but uh well and you also Google it and you'll get to ... but uh you got a lot of stuff on the website\nI Do it well enough not it's not a I've been told that our Web sites how it's a sticking a mutt\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] I Can't believe that well but you do have your schedule I just had my schedule on it well and you are one of those I always appreciated\nThat likes to explain things and explain you know the real background behind why it works and such which I think is a very good thing that's better yet you see some of this a flashy stuff and flashy promises you explain why yours really willing work yeah\nIt makes it makes a big difference you don't have to promise we know yours does work he didn't start thanks for being with his very much\nJim and things but I appreciate all those or we get here on the golden triangle All right\nThank you were going to take a break for Fox News and we will be back with more on used dogs five sixty ... for the final hour of my home answer map\nI have folks like you only show a weekly I'd forgotten just how much I didn't know before I started doing this show that most people don't or you wouldn't know unless you talked to folks like yourself\nA frequently and certainly in that buying process home inspections\nMany people I guess she's still run into are just not really aware of them are are even why you would go during the ... yeah I mean the\nThe home inspection process is actually a fairly new process in the the real estate transactions and in relative times I guess you'd say um it's one of the newer processes that are around so a lot of people that bought\nThirty years ago and just aren't familiar you know they're they're coming around bound another house and they're not familiar well I've never had a home inspection don't know what\nIt is why why do I need a home and I guess that's a good starting point so what is your home inspector you're going to do and or\nIf I'm buying a home of why would I Want to have a home inspection\nWell you know all homes come in different shapes sizes in conditions I'm In what I'm going in there and doing what the home inspections I'm going to tell you about the condition of the house\nI'm going to be reporting to you all the what we call the deficient items in the house so any items that may be a safety concern may be a way it was installed incorrectly\nOr something may not be functioning properly so I'm going to go through and I'm going to operate all the equipment in the house a which is going to include all your appliances in the house it's going to clued your AC your heat\nAh your plumbing uh checking all your electrical outlets checking the structure of your house\nA so giving you just a real good education on your house and and giving you a detailed list of items that you may want to go in and either have repaired or you can they can use that to negotiate costs uh there's just a number of things that this home inspection does for a bar\nOr to help you out in the process of buying this house so a real good education to give you all the information about what your purchasing than what you're investing your money into\nAnd of course I can say well I Know a little about houses I can check it out as we walk through or whatever\nBut what you do compared to me will be be walking through and I can see that somebody punched a hole in the water right okay I got it\nBut you are going to go so much further than a prospective buyer will go in doing a walk through you are actually\nOperating many of these appliances which I'm going to walk by and notice and hey nice dishwasher or you know nice air conditioning\nHi may turn one faucet on turn it off or you are going to go in depth aren't you\nThat's exactly right you know most people go in when they're purchasing the house they go and look at a house there may be there at the most thirty minute a thirty minute ... I'm typically they're at a minimum of about three hours um give or take you know some\nSome time there depending on the condition of the house and the age of the house uh some may take longer some might take shorter but on average about three hours\nOr so you know there's a lot of information a lot of things that get checked that uh people you know just take for granted that uh you know you're not thinking about most people aren't going to climate an addict can take a look while they're looking at the house there\nThey're looking at the a cosmetic parts of the house so it really looks nice they've got these nice appliances\nI'm going to matter of fact the the other day that is a one client of mine she really just love this microwave and I hear talking to her friends on the on the phone and I thought it was kinda funny that she was you know really never seen a microwave like this is behind your likes to yeah right and then she hangs up and I said well\nI I really understand you liked the smart way but the microwave doesn't work [laughter] so you look at my job was to test it right exactly so uh you know those are the types of\nThings that people really fall in love with you know just it it might be something as small as the microwave but uh they may not have ever operated or they may be even opened it and close it but they didn't hit that timer and run it for a minute long and check to make sure the heating properly is doing what it's supposed to be doing\nA you know you don't want to move into the house\nPut in your food in the microwave and realize my microwave doesn't work\nIt doesn't work and so that's part of what you're going to do uh I assume also things like um like plumbing French\nRight you have plumbing most people you know I asked one of the things when they asked me well why do I need a home inspection I said when when you looked at that house did you turn on any plumbing fixtures in the house well no I didn't do that I just went through in the house well okay you have no idea how that woman's going where you have no idea if your water pressure is good enough in that house you don't have any idea\nDo you have leaks underneath the things do you have leaks in the bath tub\nOr if you have what they call the hydro massage therapy equipment which is the jet a tub or does that work properly um you know these are things I'm going to fill water up all the way to the over flows on the map and sinks and\nUh I'm a run it down and is it training slow as you know I've had I've had houses where I'd drain everything and next thing I Know I Walk in the bathroom and there's water all over the floor not ... by gives me a heart attack when I see it but what that's telling me is\nThat septic system or the sewer system has backed\nUp and that's pushing water out from maybe underneath the toilets or something so\nWell and I guess sometimes people\nIn good natured people may be aware of that or whatever but maybe you've lived in the house for a long time you just know to get a hold your finger one way and just take your tongue out when you're doing something else you just know that well you just don't run all that at one time but obviously if I'm the perspective by here\nI Want everything to work and I want to know it doesn't\nRight I Want to know that oh you know when you do this year this and do that and I get people all the time\nTold me the the sellers will tell me if there are there um they'll say oh you know I don't use the bathroom and five years you know I have no idea what you know what's going on in that bathroom or or you know abuse I mean he was a bathroom and five years so everything should be fine\nAh well no honestly the higher and they are not using it doesn't necessarily right and and that's a good point also kids move away or whatever uh parts of the house argues sometime towards our house are closed off as I find that all the time to storey\nHouses the kids and moved out and the adults the parents haven't even gone upstairs skits moved out and so they have no idea what's going\nOn so another reason will take a break and come back about some more reasons why a home inspector in a home inspection he's probably a very smart thing if you're going to buy a home it's twelve Fifteen\nThank you for making April Colbert insurance agency Bomani enterprise readers choice award winner\nT

may need to be changed our door or rewiring it's going to have to be done this is probably in the whole home buying process\nThe cheapest biggest to pay back\nI could do would be to have a professional just look at the home I Am about to be responsible for\nYeah um the the prices you know just like everything else in the United states right now the prices have gone up a little bit um you know Fifteen Years ago when I first started the prices were probably averaging around two hundred and fifty dollars for all inspection\nUh they're probably around four hundred dollars on average now a for a home inspection now that's not including the termites side of things like a ... a hundred hundred and fifty somewhere lying\n... compare that to a roof compare that to a foundation or a ... acre box\nA you know yeah four hundred dollars in the grand scheme of things and the large investment two hundred thousand dollar [laughter]\nBut yeah so yeah we're we we got screwed area we're having to replace all the stuff that hey I save for a hundred dollars back in that deal I'm spending Fifteen thousand now all but hey I said that it just again I'm being\nFacetious there just seems to make good sense you were on a professional to come out and and look at that it looked at home\nAnd you know not even tell people even if I don't find anything wrong with that ... that's great news that's a good piece of mine a you spent four hundred dollars and hey you got really good peace of mind knowing what your purchasing no and uh you know your your worries outside of your normal maintenance um you\nKnow I Am I'm already seen and I also I Would hope that you found nothing I Hope that our final yeah that that is one of those things where\nYou know to uh justify spending the money I'm not what are you going to find a Fifteen thousand dollar expenditure for me I'm hoping you find find nothing and again I see peace of mind being one of the big things but also I Am in that option period if it is something significant\nI may want to talk about that a ... and I may not want the owner to repair it but I may want some price adjustments again realtors could talk to the realtors the is that it's that knowledge that I have because let me clarify this also just a moment because some people are going to say okay\nWhy do I need to you because there's going to be an appraiser come out and he looks at the house so what're you doing to maybe she's not doing because really both of you are a key in this transaction\nSo that's another thing in the transaction that a lot of times people get confused with the the home inspection and the appraisal so home inspector like I told you are going in and looking for deficient items throughout the house and we're operating and we're running things through\nA worthy appraiser he's coming out and he's looking at the value of the house the value so he is looking at the value of the house and to get that value of the house\nMost of his work is actually going to be done by doing comparable to other houses that have been recently sold ... million that general area right somewhere in the journal neighborhood area uh I don't know the ins and outs of it but he's a he's a ...\nSo going in and uh he's looking at some of the cosmetic things the finishing of the house he's looking at you know what type of for covering the how what type of counter tops what type of cameras the um how many bedrooms do you have how many ... do you have um you know how many rooms and you're not running in the water\nHe's not running water he's not looking at the small little details and um he there are some things that they will write up the or the fish and healing paint a dotted with rotten wood um they're gonna look you know they see a lot of major cracks\nThroughout the house than they thing you know there might be something structural here I'm not going to look into it too much\nUh but I've seen of ... where I'm a little concerned I'm gonna I'm going to recommend a structural engineer come out or if they look from the ground look at the roof\nAnd that roof is may be looking to be a little um you know if they may recommend the roof or come out and give it a lot of good thorough look at but they're not going to get on the roof they're not going to get on a ladder and get up there\nUm they're going to look at it from the ground up getting in the attic space\nThey do what they call ahead in the shoulder inspection of that experience of what that is is\nThey're going to basically get their head inside that addict can look around and what they can see is what they can see more as home inspector if we can get in the addict we're going to get completely inadequate all walk around that attic if we can um and we're going to take a look at the structural integrity", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jim Love", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "13"}
