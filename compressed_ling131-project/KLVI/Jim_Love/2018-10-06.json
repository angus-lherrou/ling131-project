Texas district leader based out of alpine so or some big country and some great country up there in North Texas we're going to be getting getting some updates um\nFor you all I'm On a pass on a sad note good friend I'm\nA true legend in the hunting and firearm industry um passed away earlier this week Bill Carter a owner of Carter's country passed away um got the call I'm Harold called me and then I contacted a\nTommy's a duck away it's um and and the family just to to extend condolences but what a what a great man who really was a true visionary um biggest\nFarms retailer in the country uh did things to promote hunting conservation initiatives get people involved with shooting I certainly going to be missed and um\nOur condolences extended to his wife Ellen I'm son Billy and daughter Laurie in the entire\nCarter Country ah extended family um but I'm\nJust wanted to to let you all do and and tell you what during this hunting season think about old bill I tell you what his ads that ran in the newspapers\nAnd um we have passed on many of them old bills says some great words of wisdom about the outdoors and um things that are that he said truly are timeless they were\nThey were valid back when and they're valid today and they'll be valid on into the future when it comes to hunting shooting and our\nOutdoor heritage is all the national scene we've got some News I'm a judge Dana Christian center of the U.S district court a Montana sided this week with environmentalist a Native American groups overall in the U.S fish and Wildlife Service\nDecision to de list originally from the threatened the species list the move effectively cancels her schedule hunt since Nineteen Ninety One christiansen wrote a forty eight page decision and what you say the decision was it about the\nEthics of hunting because the U.S fish and Wildlife Service failed to make a reasonable decision and considering the population impact of hunting there are seven hundred Yellowstone grizzlies today compared to a few as a hundred and thirty two in Nineteen Seventy five the decision was delivered just two days before the hunting season was to begin\nUm another piece of national news coming from our friends for the national Shooting Sports foundation um and that's more than sixteen million modern sporting rifles or in the private and legal ownership of Americans\nMaking them the opposite of uncommon despite the ladder claimed by US Senator Dianne Feinstein a Democrat from California Senator Feinstein ask judge Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing if an AR Fifteen style rifle could be banned because they're designed for military use\nIn fact there are not and judge Kavanaugh wasn't taking the bait have responded to the question centers on judicial precedent which holds its semi automatic handguns are commonly owned\nSince semi automatic rifles operate the same way one bullet fired for each pulled the trigger they're commonly owned by the millions of law abiding Americans\nAnd here's a little bit more information on firearms more than Eighteen million Americans are legally carrying concealed farms today that's up from eleven million four years ago according to the U.S conceal carry association\nIn a Washington Examiner report\nInteresting lea it's not just conservative Republicans illegally carry firearms half of the ... are going to those who identify as Democrats USCC of founder and president Tim Schmidt says the findings show that firearms or an issue that is more than frittering freedom\nThan political ideology of you think that um

our state park police um applications are being taken to generate the next elite state law enforcement officers\nWith the ah sixty third Texas game ordinance state park police could that class applications are being accepted now through November sixteen\nUm state parks are charged with protecting the citizens of Texas and nearly ten million annual visitors uses state park says chief west

state\nPolice alright folks gonna take a break and we'll be right back right after this [noise] this is Harold reminding you that it's time to get\nThese are just a couple of reasons why ... journal\nHas been named one of the time and outdoor publications in Texas to yourself by picking up a copy ... journal at your local newsstand or better yet subscribing say sixty percent all become a price\nTo subscribe to using a major run a guard call one eight hundred [noise] to do to board the OJ one eight hundred to do two more age six five or subscribes to Jeremy online and Texas outdoors journal dot com\nOh we're back with Texas outdoor news and tell you what this is this is a fun segments\nDo we do this time of year with all eight or ... district leaders really enjoy working with these gentlemen over the years and um some of them are getting getting a few years like I Am on me and one of 'em is uh my buddy Kevin ... from brown with Kevin how you doing today\nI'm doing well bill is always good to talk to you\nAbsolutely hey listen you know when we talked about a month ago for the forecast that appears in the October issue of Texas outdoors journal I'm obviously we all we start talking about rain coming out last hunting season and conditions and um\nYou know in talking to you really get an idea of how big Texas is and how big your district is because there was some drought condition setting in and and you made a comment that there were parts of your district\nThat had conditions that folks were reporting were worse than twenty eleven that that that's kinda scary\nYeah it it uh it didn't last long but\nI think that different uh was that we had many more days of a much higher temperatures and so you know you get you get the wind and you get a hundred and Fifteen string a hundred and ten a hundred and Fifteen degree days and X. men you know a month and a half two months since\nAny significant rainfall things really go downhill\nQuick yeah and and that's kind of what we saw well because\nOf the drought condition because coming out a way of showing season in in your part of the state so we had some drought conditions show or didn't fare too well for the beginning of amber growth on our on our white ...\nNo it really did and you know we didn't have just a a a super winter um it was it was fairly dry\nAnd then a spring didn't didn't provide us any relief and in fact you know it was it was in a in the nineties in March\nAnd so the heat in the grass started really early and ah and I think we're we're seeing that in a in not only body lakes and an aunt low development that fond crops as well\nSo [noise] yeah it's a it's taken a toll\nYou know there is a term that's used by you biologist where you talk about foreign recruitment fall on survival I'm just real quick give give us all inside due to the difference of those\nWell\nYou know I'm One has to do with um how many fond like it to 'em you know a certain age six months or years where\nThey live here but fond of crowd whenever we generally talk about a foreigner crop it's it's you know how many fond are hitting the ground how how many how many how many fond are being born and so [noise]\nUm there's a couple of things that goes on and you know and in winter and early spring if that does earning good condition it there's there's poor range conditions\nUm a lot of those bonds won't even be born while there'll be stillborn or you know have problems and then kind of what happened this year\nWas um [noise] for the most part we had quite a few fond man born but conditions are so bad when they came into this world that are in and didn't get better during the early part of their life\nYou know they they didn't make it the first couple of weeks or months of their life and so there's there's\nTwo ways of of ah not getting on to that to that adult\nStage and and that's that's kind of what happened this year\nGot you you know you're part of the state uh I've enjoyed hunting up there for years and years and years and ah there's places up there that just half a nominal a coil hunting when we've got quail but uh again drought kind of caught our ground nesting birds particularly our our ...\nMan you know\nThe the I guess the peak of of Bob likes um hatches and and asking activity is engineered you know early part Asian and we're right in the middle of the heat and drought and so\nUh and had a lot of hot day and a lot of grad days after that so kind of like a fall on the chicks that were hatched um just just didn't like it very long\nWell a couple of years a couple of years ago though didn't we have a few years where we were shown to rebound now how does a bad year correlate to what a mercurial rehab from those are better at you as\nWell you know a coil short lived fired and so all life expectancy is less than two years on average in so I'm really depended on\nLast year's crop of birds to\nTo carry over and so last year was was not a great hatch either and so we started off with with the euro adults to produce those chicks and then we had a really bad hatch and so this fall as is looking pretty dismal for for oil hunting\nYou know sitting down here in Houston when I watch a weather radar and every now and then I'll see the radar light up in your part of the state you know get excited going come on rain on Israel to wear a\nOr doing a rain dance here\nThey are ... ... is in the last thirty days since um we did the report for the magazine have you gotten any weather is there any signs that maybe we're starting to see 'em a maybe a wetter trim coming\nWell we did a not long after we talked to a lady just days it it started raining and uh actually to to look at most of our country now you never know that we were in a severe drought\nYou know back to three months ago um we get some ten plus finches oh out in some places and so for the most part the current habitat conditions\nUm they don't really tell the tale because things look really good um but but it's what happened you know during those critical times a backyard here in the spring and summer that it's going to be affecting what hunters experience in the woods spirit hound hunting season\nOr use school me well and that's the next question I Want to ask hum given the conditions are given the moisture are we seeing ... come up or is that pendulum still ah over on the\nHunter side um we're we're going to be moving all more this year\nWell I think it's a mixed bag hum is we are getting lots of of fall Forbes and uh and that's good um you know in an acre and crops are are\nAre spotty or to the point where you know some areas of the district or the biologist says than it's a bumper crop of acres and others it's it's a bust you know so um that's going to be kind of spotty so I think in general though hundreds you're gonna have to\nThey're going to have to hunt pretty hard for that trophy here um I think most of the trophies are going to come out of the the older age class here rather than a you know younger dear I'm In in really good years you see\nGood conditions and in those younger deer can really excel but I think it's going to be a bed and asked me an average to to maybe below average year for the young and middle age class there so so there's trophies out there you're just going to have to look for an older dear I Believe\nGot you one final question we got about thirty seconds before we take a break um twenty eleven were pretty well put that in our rear view mirror we're talking about age or older age going on so we still are seeing some on six may have seven and a half year old dear that I'm I'm maybe we're not impacted by twenty eleven\nI I think we're I think we get that in our rear view mirror I'm sure do um you know this this year may be one that that we need to look at you know three four five years from now say you know it was that was the cause I'm just like twenty eleventh\nVery good All right Kevin listen we

I can see everything in your colon 'cause\nAgain if there's flakes are small pieces of stool that could be covering something in on your about wall so you want the ... as clean as possible so that's the one thing that patients tend to complain about the most is just the prep seems to be a little bit taxing the night before\nAnd I don't think they've come out with anything better are less taxing just kind of one of those things you have to go through in order to get the test so um they don't they they do have these are still studies out there\nWhere um and the the most populous Coca Cola guard\nAnd we're now been offering that for the past a few weeks or basically it's more of a genetic test for killing cancer member colon cancer every cancer has a\nHas a marker on it that can be identified so the color guard is more like a genetic cancer test\nWhere you give a sample of your stool and they check for the genetic presence of colon cancer and that's an alternative route\nTo colon cancer screening and it has to be done once a year and you can ask your primary care physician health care professional about cola guard C O L O G A A R U D\nA my preference is to get a call ... could be because you just see things\nThat the color guard might not see that otherwise could cause some problems so my bias is the ... but for those who don't have the time they don't want to do the ...\nIs still uncomfortable with procedures maybe they had a bad outcome all they know someone who did and it just shot and then just go ahead and get a color guard again that has to be done once a year\nYou can also do stools still card Sam still cards and basically that's a different process where they're checking for the presence of blood that's an old thing we used to do\nAnd I'm kind of falling off a little bit but it's still available and we still use it for those shot patient but that that's something that you can be a you can do instead of the cold and asked me and that's a once a year as well I'm married from like Charles what's up\nLast week\nThe elevation head of the ad and said there were three or four one what are the advocate\nUm elevation headed but I think we're talking about a C. H. F. and [noise] um I don't think I gave three reasons to\nDo it but it had well they are not three diseases I guess is what I write write three diseases or heart failure\nOr acid reflux is another big one as to why someone would raise the head of the bit heartfelt here I'm Sorry ... acid reflux [laughter] that's bad bad ass reflux and then you know chronic lung disease is a lotta times will\nCause the person to not be able to breathe lying flat and they have to sit up as well like COPD chronic bronchitis chronic emphysema\nAnd are smokers they a lotta times will not be able to lay flat they have to keep the headed their bed or as well ah so those are the kind of more common three diseases that I Know of where a person will prioritize keeping the head of the bed or\nUm or even sleeping in a recliner I have a lot of my patients they\nWill get a lazy boys and they're making they're making a lazy boys bigger and bigger and they look more like beds and so a lot of patients will just get a lazy boy that's big comfortable kind of bad light and they all sleep and that instead of a real bad\nYou know 'cause lazy bought can move up and down\nAnd they have cut poll stuff\nOn it for us and hey whatever works for ... a person that's fine but I I guess you'd have to stand that\nYou know just sick or you get the more it's going to probably interfere with your sleeping in some of those cases I'm Down in some diseases will cause excessive sleeping dementia is one of the bigger ones where patients will tend to have access to sleeping however\nA dementia is as a very individualized disease and what I mean by that is every dimension patient is totally different some are hyper by it and some are not hyper you know some are very violent and some are passive and dust so\nAh so it is kind of depends on the core personality of the patient has dementia you know a lot of times if they were they were quiet of people in general\nAnd on confrontational as their disease progression standing kind of exacerbates that and the ... vice versa you know this guy was a hothead and was very argumentative confrontation then who's they're going to be more like that but\nI find even more of that yeah it's kind of dementia that the families are just\nKind of shocked at how it changes the personality of a patient and this this once very nice loving person is now yelling and screaming and threatening and wanting to fight and just\nParanoid and it's very very uh disruptive to everyone and it's very scary but uh back to the original question yeah heart failure lung failure and ash reflux those are kind of my big three for having to raise the head of your bed\nRight All right that it I really appreciate it\nEverything he can and I'm so back to my uh help straining and again these are tests that you should be getting automatically and if you don't argue not getting them then certainly\nI'm asked your health care profession about that so the cold enough to pay a certain age of fifty everyone knows or not everyone but we've been big promoters of breast cancer screening\nAnd so mammograms is the way we screen for that of a asked patients to check their breast females every month to self breast examination I Do recommend you do that but the X ray component can start as early as forty\nFour zero that is for general or patients again if you have a strong family history or someone in your family was diagnosed earlier like they're in their thirties like your mother or your sister was diagnosed in their thirties\nAnd there's some concern about some genetic predisposition than ... patients will start sooner getting mammograms and normally the annually once a year and again I just started forty there's been some controversy or with that some uh\nSome authorities are recommending starting at the age of fifty but I go ahead and started forty because again I've personally I've seen patients young people be diagnosed with breast cancer in their thirties and forties so it's an eye opener and you realize that can happen and yes they're going to be a lot of patients tests that are normal\nAs you get into your deep sixties seventies would kind of starts slowing down and looking at your expected lifespan and if it seems to be you know five ten years less than ten years you got a ton of medical problems that we're probably going\nOn that screen for you because again your chances of developing prostate cancer at that stage of your life for a lot less\nAnd so we just kind of slow down 'cause you know we have all this technology we have all this sounds you've got to know what to do with it\nHow long should as a camera shot\nCaller how long should eighty five year old woman wait to have her second shots who sought\nSecond shot of ... most of the time the pharmacies will dictate dictate that to them are based on what I'm hearing from my patients normally you know three to two to four weeks is what I'm hearing for for most of my patients\nAnd uh you know if you go a little bit on two weeks of little beyond for weeks is not a big deal none of this stuff is rigid [noise]\nAh I again I think because it's strong we're trying to cut down on the adverse reactions so you know give you a little bit and then what let your body to respond to it and then come back and get the the last does\nA ... with the Russian Greg so I think it's two to four weeks but the you know ... just like every doctor's office a little different every pharmacy is a little different I hear different things and\nWhat collectively as a medical community trying to\nFormalized a lot of this routine things that happen every day\nUm and what I mean by that is no matter where you go who you see you're kind of supposed to be getting the same stuff happening to you in terms of a lot of this routine stuff like I'm Talking about these mammograms and called ... and vaccines\nUm blood work this kind of a core routines standardize blood work assessment that should be happening no matter who you're going to you and you're trying to work on it it's very difficult again\nAs I can tell you're from a practitioner standpoint your experience a lot of times dictate what you believe this depending on\nWhat sort of problems you've had sort of diseases you've seen what do what you see works for you then it's obviously going to impact how you practice as health care professional and that's the thing that cannot be change yes there's all these guidelines nice books and all these recommendations but\nFace to face in the trenches every single day there are certain factors that you can't control that will impact the way you kind of practice and do things and that's the part that can't be controlling that support there will always impact\nKind of a little bit different twists all of a different change with\nThe way things are done no different from barbecue religion and everything else a lot of this stuff is very local it's ... it's very regional\nAnd that's because we kind of have to uh been or just to the environment\nOr another camera shot caller or who all these cameras that causes a don't be afraid of them that the dentist you know [laughter] not going to cause pain or if you've never had chicken pox can you get the shingle shot and I just does come to a really good question because it does come up a lot there's a misconception\nAbout that well I never had chicken pox and I was growing up so I don't need the shingles vaccine which is wrong you still need the shingles vaccine remember the chicken pox is a virus as well as the um the um\nThe shingles outbreak is a virus and then kind of in the same family the herpes a family\nOf viruses and so you're not a candidate or you don't you don't have to have had the chicken pox infection remember a lot of people don't even remember that stuff when you're young\nYou're just you're your memory formation is that Israel bust and a lot of the things that happen to me and you just don't remember\nI don't even remember if I had it and even if I did it didn't seem to leave a lasting impression on me so most of the time chicken pox occurs when you're young but the the vaccination\nProcess starts at a very young age and is very robust and cuts down on a lot of these ah infections that we used to see so a lot of times folks do not have any sort of outbreak of chicken pox but\nThat is not a reason to not get it just because the herpes virus is somewhat ubiquitous and environment most of us will become infected with it\nJust as a part of an aging and so you might that might not get chicken pox but the virus that causes a shingles outbreak is still in your you still get infected with it's like\nWhen sometimes you may feel a little off the maybe yellow fever achy ... your headache no last a few days that could have been your\nHerpes virus infection right there but you know you get better and you go on and you don't even think about it and you know because your body did what he was supposed to do but yeah from the Stan organisms are around us all the time viruses parasites fungus bacteria I mean we live in a micro biology world\nAnd these a lot of times are the organisms that will cause infection to us but we've adopted our means system has adopted to these organisms so most of the time we knew we don't worry about it you know because our bodies can fight off these uh most of these infections most of the time\nIt's only when we get an active infection that we think about this stuff but you can never rid yourself of these organisms\nWhich is why when we have these commercials on TV about\nYou know HP robotics and the ah anti bacterial soap you know I don't see too many commercials about that anymore they used to promote that heavily oh and it kills Ninety nine percent bacteria and\nPeople running out getting all this anti bacterial cell blah blah blah I don't see that campaign anymore and it's because it's a fantasy to think that because you use a cell that's supposed to kill not ... percent bacteria that\nYou're not an ... percent clean and sterile and you've killed all these billions of bacteria scan and your house and it's just that just marketing you know that stuff doesn't exist and\nYou don't have to kill all these bacteria you know a lot of times the bacteria helping us\nLive better so you have to be careful about that you don't want to be to sterile and you want to let the kids go out there and get dirty and put dirt in your mouth and just kinda live because your body gets exposed nearby to learn how to defend itself and if you constantly trying to put yourself in a bubble\nAll the time those are the patients I found the sicker uh there's one thing I I was at puffing some guys in my car the other day and I saw with now\nThey have these glove these plastic gloves you can put on when you pop your gas you know for I guess patients who may feel uncomfortable grabbing the handle of the gas pump\nBecause of all the handset touchy gasp up every day now they have these plastic gloves that you can kind of like the little plastic thing you can put over the toilet seat if you're in a public restroom now they have gloves and personally people I don't recommend it you got to be out there and expose yourself\nTo the bacteria to the fungus to the ... the the your immune system is going to pretty much do what it's supposed to do\nAnd hey it's OK every now and have one section is not a big deal I'm so try not to be too scared out there when you go pump little gas anyway I'm going to go on a second break a non state scale vi one

to that and uh certainly a fact check that but just haven't haven't heard that one um and so we're trying to obviously get everybody on board with\nThe vaccines and we don't want anything getting your way and again there are a lot of people who they just don't get the vaccine they don't believe in him they've heard a lot of bad things about him and again it's just a recommendation I'm a strong recommendation but it's just a recommendation and if you don't want to have it done and you don't have to get it done\nBut on with my uh screenings Saturday when we have so many to go we have the eight or to screen remember the eight or to is the big big artery in your blood vessel the main conduit of blood that comes from your heart and kind of feeds everything anyway they have promoted doing a\n... screen of they order in men sixty five and above who've ever smoke and it's done with just an ultrasound can be done in your health care professionals office very easy nonpaying takes a few minutes anyway so if you're a man sixty thousand above and you've ever smoke\nThen you need this eight or to screening cars and Ayotte ... out there most of the time we found them coincidentally or incidentally for other reasons and the idea is if it gets bigger or as is getting bigger than you may be more at risk for it rushing and that's that's a life\nThreatening that's a medical emergency and\nThat's just not good for you\nAre so few in that category go ahead and get that diabetes has a lot of screening um and that's a big issue in our country so every year you need to have what they call it dilated retinal eye exam\nYou need to have a yearly foot examination or you know anytime you go into your doctor's healthcare professions office just examined you feed\nA you need to be on a lotta times an aspirin as well as a Staten cholesterol medication\nI'm like a ... for one of those medications obviously to be checking your cholesterol and you're a one sea level cut up on a regular

... fan and I'll be happy to hang up and listen\nTo [noise] [noise] okay sure no problem you know at at the uh calcium hearts skin has not really um gotten into a a routine in terms of screening there's there's um as far as I Know there is no national\nAgreed upon recommendation to implement a heart ... in the screening test a for patients a lot of the ... some cardiologist will have that screening tool in their office and they themselves will implement that into their screening process which is not wrong\nAnd ideas that if your calcium score is higher\nThan you are more likely at risk to have a cardiovascular event and you need to be prioritized in terms of your medications and testing\nBut as far as I Know it is not entered into a routine screening process at this point but some doctors some doctors will ask that you do that and that's certainly find again your relationship with the health care professional is where it all starts\nThe doctor healthcare professional reads all these recommendations he knows what's out there or she er she\nAnd we'll make decisions in terms of how to implement that information there's some things that that nobody argues about and that's the stuff I'm Talking about today mammograms calling us with well a little argument\nBut for the most part everybody agrees that ... screwed calcium hearts screening tests are still kind of out there it's new technology we are using everybody's kind of using it differently\nSo if your doctor recommends it and you trust your doctor didn't get it anyway I go on my ah last break a non six shelve yeah one

before and no one is going to ask Nolan what part of Brooklyn he's from [laughter] and I've got a half but [noise] if I don't think he's got to be mistaken for a Yankee\nAh died thirty three Gerald ... is with his college than classics which by the way tell folks where you're located we haven't done that where you located goes I Know you don't mind with all of the things we've been talking about this morning you don't mind showing folks around the shop and showing off some of that technology absolutely\nWell we're at the busiest part of interstate ... we're at the highway Ninety exit or on the west side and we're between the Budweiser beer distributor and Hooters restaurant in our true story building right they're pretty hard to\nMiss yeah at least either way you look at it you're going to hit is five Fifteen or ten south well you know I'll tell you what a has amazed me when I had been over there is that it first of all impressive building beautiful facility but you don't realize how far back it goes ah don't let the site from the interstate\nFool you as to how large it is you're going back forever you've got a lot going on there and a lot of uh of the latest technology equipment\nIs it's a two and a half acre site and we're we're at the edge of saying you occupied two and a half acre you every inch of it and then and you know property management facility management is high on our priority list and every day\nAh we operate in a thirty five thousand square foot facility and we're about to add on and twenty Nineteen for some of the new equipment and facility needs that we have\nOut now also one of the things and we want to get to a couple of other topics but\nWhen you talk about accidents or most of us thankfully we we don't have an accident or we've only had a couple of accidents maybe in our life and maybe nothing recently in ... times have changed so you try and make it an easy one I Do have an accident\nI get to say where the vehicle is taken correct\nExactly exactly it's a ... and it's just a a variety of you your ownership I owned a vehicle you owned a vehicle you are responsible for it and you certainly want to take it to a repair shop that you have confidence in and you need to know their capabilities you need to know their training\nYou need to know basically their equipment level can they handled today's cars\nBecause if you're driving a Nineteen eighty model car\nThat's one criteria there if you're driving a two thousand and five model car that's another criteria for a pair but if you're driving today's\nTwenty fifth inning and above twenty fourteen and above\nYou need to be at a truly certified repair facility to assist and assess your repairs\nAnd and do you work with all of the insurance company shifts we did a gestures and all of that you know you can work with them but uh certainly uh I Know there are maybe sometimes when maybe a an insurance company will suggest well you know we we work with the shopper we work with add shop\nThat's well and good but then again does not mean you got to work with that job and ended up being there's anything wrong with that job but if I Want to leave and classics insurance company and tell me no\nThat's true but we always want our consumer to decide where they want their car taken don't take it on the suggestion of the guy\nAssisting in the pavement ... nearly ... years that factor alone can set up an adversarial scenario right from the day when you're right and then it just doesn't feel good so do you want to go if it's your best friend that works at a repair shop and you feel it's going to be your best repair will\nPossibly that's the way to go only ask that you do the research to the repair shop you go to ... do the background check talk to customers\nTalked to other folks are asked other people in the industry has a reputation ... before you decide\nBefore you decide and you know frankly that's a good thing to do sort of any time because it would ever really expect an accident so when you have a friend that maybe has had an accident and vehicle repair asking where they went how they felt about it or ask around so that if unfortunately you ever have that situation you were already prepared because I Know\nAt the time of an accent we're all sort of ... we're we're showed up we don't know quite what to do and then we're more susceptible to a and then later on I I've ... people later on and tell me I don't know why I took it there [laughter] well I don't either\nWell I'll tell you that collision classes are cargo was our car is the industry standard for writing the repair facilities and because we're a card gold\nWe are one of ... percent in the entire nation that has this designation so it's a very elite group there's only a very small handful of folks even in this area but even more importantly throughout the nation ten percent of all the ... jobs\nThat's a small category and it was a great honor to going to be done\nI'd and as you say you have these different eras vehicles if you're driving seven inches of fourteen Fifteen sixteen or Seventeen Eighteen you gotta have it done right at a ... one of these things we've been talking a lot of my body and paint and and how that works but this a crash avoided system\nYeah it's really sort of come into play and what that that probably the last five years that Israeli now as I've said before you start out on the very expensive vehicles\nAnd suddenly you know it's arrived when the least expensive vehicles you look at it on the showroom floor has the same thing this is in some mid range vehicles so how is absolutely absolutely a mid range vehicle odds are I'm going to find it when I go by a car it's going to have that in order a\nTruck and then every menu factor is pouring their time in to a assisted driver a systems which is advance a driver assisted system a D. A. S. ... and the whole scenario of this as it's slowly with each model year\nThe manufacturers are increasingly adding a artificial intelligence to your automobile\nWe were talking with a consumer that's at our facility just this week and his wife's car has a new accurate and then you accurate has an extensive amount of a driver assisted programs\nAnd that's a car that you see a lot of lot of ... certainly if you're on your vehicle\nHer new car since is her grip on the steering wheel to determine if she stressed or in a a anxious situation really reads back pain grip\nIt reads whether you're in the lane and cast lane keeping cameras keeping everything focus it keeps up with blind spot indicators own cars on the side of each lane with you on the road edge as you're driving along\nAnd there's all of these that are interactive by the middle of second and then feeding back to the car steering breaking and even um the impact of boarding system so it continues on and on and on from cameras to radars to sensors\nLives in maintaining your family's safety I have the utmost respect for all families and their needs\nA I really I hate to say it and so bluntly but whatever the insurance company tells me to do has literally nothing to do with how I intend to fix that car it will be fixed by the standards of the opium manufacturer\nThat the manufacturer says we'll make that vehicle like new and as safe as when it pushed\nKnew exactly following their procedures in getting more and more\nDifficult to do that every day as a matter of fact a new industry has popping up and that is the group that is doing the scanning and measuring\nOf the accident avoidance systems so here's Doppler radar in here here's the newest of the wavelength radars there's eight seven nine and cameras to a car that all have to be\nReadjusted and read a formulated to function with the car and so now there are new companies popping up that will be coming one day soon to this area that they will be involved in certifying and calibrating cameras and radars that's all they'll do\nBecause now we have to take them back to the dealerships ... there's not any collusion repair\nFacility that has the ability to aim all of that we have to go back and let the different menu factors help us calibrate these cars so you'll shouldn't have companies that that's what they do ... do help do that they'll set 'em up there'll be these specialized facilities with this highly highly intelligent and equipment\nThat will be measuring and reviewing and setting up these cars\nWe've come a long way from Kenya hammer that didn't exactly or a long long way nine forty eight huge dog five sixty kale vi\nAiming love of Chrysler hurting children's as long\nWe know that many kids love animals\nAnd when they encounter an animal it helps breakthrough\nEmotional berries abuse and neglect sickness and all kinds of hopeless doing this for about six years now and we've been able to introduce kids everything from Wall of the pythons ... tortoises to gliders and is a nonprofit we founded to do this help\nThem in children suffer in our area can be a line\nOr on your phone ... latest news and weather is on news talk five sixty K. O. V. I. [noise]\n\nYou saw five sixty vi yours\nTruly the classics I guess today Gerald candidate a who\nHangs out of college and in classics or has an ice building over there I don't really get an ice office too I guess [laughter] you never in its eyes they they tell you it's nice at any rate uh\nYeah I'm Amazed also when I go over you have some training areas because again to emphasize training training and training at your hygiene guy over there you've got training going on for the staff\nPlus just the IT knowledge needed to repair the vehicles\n... incredible you know we have a conference table that seats thirty we bring those folks rent every single weekday morning from about seven Fifteen and we're out of there by about a a fifty something I mean a seven fifty I'm tunes\nAnd so here is all these people going through our daily work flow sheets and we've got a large flat screen on the wall and then we got connected to laptops that we can show production cycles and what's going on\nOr we do ... hours that the facility where we go through and put 'em the audio system is really speakers over the ceiling I mean we're very very advanced in trying to keep trying as a matter of fact next month\nIn the month of November will be bringing in a doctor of psychology to assist us in understanding the needs of today's consumer\nThat's changed from the day last spring because we're all on social media we all have this great high expectations and mediate service an immediate response so now you'll see us doing less and less phone calls and more and more text messages and the words matter\nAnd that does make sense and you're absolutely right about that the or whether it be an email or a tax you on our mind seat you in person a half heartedly comes across totally differently when you're reading the\nCold words yeah Jo Ann ... yeah right and it doesn't sound right yeah you know are redrawing but you can see somebody and you know you're planning around that's funny but but if it's not funny if it somehow now so we don't want to have any missteps and we bring in the right professionals to teach our feet wet and it's\nInteresting too because my perception is also in this era of social media\nIs both positive and negative of how to deal with it\nBecause there is a lot of the eurozone is social media out there or whether it be on YouTube or ... or the person comes in\nAnd you can't do quite what they want because it's not ethical or it can't be done to the next thing you know there's a blast against collusion and classics on the social media ... we're in an\nAge that is very different your customer now is coming in with very different ideas gifts and perspectives the it'd be Twenty years ago\nWell you're so right and we have a we have a need for a social media representative for our company right now we're looking and examining folks that could fit that bill and it's not because we have bad issues because we have great successes and we want the public to know about it\nWe'll let people know how it works with school and on and we need to let them know they need to be educated and they need to understand the investment of time in the material and equipment to make those accomplishments that we're making daily\nOr in the circumstances are also all of these new repairs\nAnd all these new aspects we just discussed during this time take more time to repair and have more dealership involvement because of the special ... of them there so the ideals of having a quick quick repair will shrink slightly\nBecause of the logistics of the repair and so we have had car just this week who couldn't go home on a designated target date and I emphasize the word ... market\nThat because the communication link between one computer system and scanners are cameras or any type of radar would not talk effectively until something else was replaced\nNow outwardly the car was one hundred percent finished but inward laying internally there were still a communication link between these active systems once that's in place we cannot let that cargo home until that is absolutely resolved and\nAll systems check this is no different than NASA than to lay a launch because of a reason that computers tell him there's a sensor about not worth the same is happening in your car today there's all kinds of active systems the car will not be released until all systems are okay\nWow it is nine fifty six Jim ... automotive you know where the located fifty four Ninety five college in Beaumont you know it because so many ... cars and trucks they're just like

that experience to work on your car your truck your van\nThey're going to get it fixed it doesn't matter how many vehicles you have in the driveway when one's down somebody's inconvenienced and they know that\nThey're going to handle that repair as quickly as possible with no surprises for you\nAnd get you back on the roads are going to let you know what's going on every step of the way let's you know about the costs are going to treat you honestly just like you want to be treated claims automotive fifty four Ninety five college ball modern Monday through friday seven thirty each morning give him a call at eight for two Nineteen hundred\n\nJog five sixty ... wrap up the auto show which is a ... and classics are located\nAt five fifty self I aged ten and uh that's easy to find an absolutely\nEasy to find and we have a great facility would love to give tours and loved the field those calls during the show in certainly at the office but we have a complete staff that's ready to assist you and can answer those questions before you get into an accident that's when it's critical\nWell a title is going to be your right to own the property I'm so property or ... um their filed a record with the county clerk's office so I'm basically you know having the title of property would would be the document that says that you own it\nTitle insurance guarantees that you own the property free and clear that no one else has an interest than the poverty and there's no debts are leans against the property\nI'm so it's you know similar to an insurance policy when we think insurance we think auto or homeowners so you know it's it's guaranteeing and that\nYou own that property and a lenders going to require it when you purchase a home mhm I'm skinny but it's different from auto and homeowners in that\nIt's not a yearly premium it's a one time premium that ... thing rioting and and your issue that policy and it's good for as long as you on the property\nSo basically the title is going to say that hey I own this place right\nFree and clear and you know if if someone comes up later and says hey you know this is my grandpa property and it should have gone to me and you know title insurance and protect scene in that sense because we ensured that you were getting that property free and clear so on you can follow claim with the uh ... um\nAnd then we would handle that for you so\nSo that means obviously that um if you're willing to ensure that regime owns this then you're probably doing a little work in your office to ensure ... demos is absolutely yeah we we have\n... title examiners that um\nGo back and do the deed records the um\nYou know the divorces the all of the things that have gone on with our property to make sure that that title was conveyed correctly each time that changed hands and also to ensure that you know the last person who owned at their credit card judgment doesn't get overlooked and gets passed on to you\nKnow now much too important things and we'll talk about both of them that look first just a simple matter of of debt I'm so the person I received the property from\nCould have had a death absolutely or maybe a lawsuit ... judgment didn't pay the taxes high all support\nLanes so Charles support would\nCome on credit cards they didn't pay anything you own and you know if you own money to someone they can place a judgment against that that property\nSo maybe I don't get title insurance and I think I omitted I go to college then at the enemy your problem the person you know the next person says why won't a title policy\nAt a company like yours is going to uncover this yes no I Can't go back to the guy that I bought the property from those folks I it's\nNow my ... right I mean you could try to the problem yeah they've they've gotten out from under it so are they going to pay for it probably not [laughter] you know in order for you to be able to sell the property you you're going to have to clear\nIt up in one way or another um and usually that means paying that debt now is never ears\nNow some people may say well I I just go down the courthouse and check that out but you could have leans filed and all sorts of manners in all sorts of different\nPlayers lately I mean but this was not a simple prowess not\nAnd we start to more than just the county clerk ... um we look at bankruptcy if we look at\n'em you know like I said that the all of the ... that can be filed against that is their mortgage against the property 'cause that needs to be paid off on was there a divorce and who got the property does this person have the right to sell the property\nAnd I did the person pass away did\nYou know did they have a pro rated will did all of the air sign off that needed to sign off you know there's just a lot that goes into it and um it's a very detailed and and um\n[noise] it's a very detailed\nProcess process it is quite frankly a criminal ... yourself process I had I not recognize hearing a lot about\nWho this myself and again some of those things you check I had not thought about that so if someone has passed away the wheel has to be pro baited and then all the heirs have to do whatever the air and that was one of 'em is left out yeah\nThat's a common misconception you know a lot of people think oh I have a will um and that takes care of everything well you have to probate that will most idle insurance to recognize it and and allow you know what you asked for in a will to happen otherwise it's it's just a piece of paper so and\nYou know we have to make sure that the the correct people that are named join in on the deed at the same thing with divorces you know is\nNow that sounds like that could get very ... and there's a lot of times there may be short of a informal green much right maybe you've seen this at a divorce case where ah you're going to get the house and I'm going to take the car or whatever but we don't really do anything legally with it\nRight I mean you have to do it all has to be in writing for high end um it has to be written into the final divorce decree it hasn't been specifically address that property by legal discouraging um and if it does it then we're going to require that that spouse that you were divorcing join in on the deed we have to just make sure all ends are covered\nAll injure cut as an ally and that's one of those things which are certainly for the investments in the title insurance very very well worth it uh in fact probably one of the least expensive things you're going to do and the transaction for what could happen if you do absolutely\nWell and here's the thing if you're getting a mortgage lender is going to require require policy um they're requiring lenders title policy\nOr owners title policy it's optional but it's it's not much more uh again it's a one time premium that you pay and the fees are dictated by Texas Department of insurance that's not something that can be inflated it's going to be the same price whatever title agency you go to\n'em and again it's just so important to you know know that you own your property free and clear and uh be protected in the event that you know somebody shows up at your door and says this is not you know this is my land [laughter] and I guess\nYou'd probably over the years has probably happened once or twice or somebody shows up this long lost distance or whatever and thank goodness for the time\nThe policy in the thorough search or they're able to say or defend themselves in life as a matter of fact this is to is and you are not\nKnown before you go to break that that is an interesting point you make about the title insurance was going to be required by law lived or make sense they want to protect their investments same reason ... going to require you to have insurance the same reason to\nLot of News I'm Karen McHugh hundreds of peaceful protesters were outside the Supreme Court as the Senate prepares to vote on the Brett Kavanaugh

don't wait until it's too late ... eight six six one two three three to talk about your insurance coverage Jim love here and I don't have to tell you just how tight the real estate market is in southeast Texas\nThat's why it's more important than ever before to select the right mortgage company and talk to them before you talked to the real for real there's not going to show you many houses if you haven't talked to a mortgage company\nWho do I recommend will gateway mortgage Alison Eldridge Chris weight they've been doing it for years there the superior team there\n[noise]\nWell scattered showers and thunder storms or continuing our forecast for today and Sunday a little bit less coming up by Monday we'll look for high today up into the upper eighties illiterate I loaded mid seventies the script prosecutor market basket weather forecasts loose talk five sixty kale yeah it is currently\nSeventy five an hour on a new start five sixty kill the broadcasting from ... dot com studios [noise]\nDogs five sixty killed by and we are talking title insurance a crystal Williams capital title is our gift always a delight to have her on the show three locations of capital title in southeast Texas and of course a part of a a long time for a long time footprint\nIn the southeast Texas when it comes to a title insurance we were charging a before in the last half hour about why you needed some things that could possibly go wrong and why are you a need title insurance\nAnd I suspect over the years you've you've seen some things go wrong or do you have some advice just based on that obviously you can't give legal advice or whatever but if if I'm thinking about\nSelling a home or have some family property and I want to make sure my kids get a little of it or maybe a grandchild get some of it one day somebody's going to sell something and I got to come to a company like yours or\nAny advice me I I Need each transaction that we make needs to be clearly drawn within the scope of of good real estate practice\nRight absolutely so you don't want to you don't want to print formed from the Internet\nOkay dumber one gonna work\nDried out go Google a deed in print off the first thing you see you know their standard language that has to be included in those so and even if you don't use it how agency consult a real estate attorney they can compare the documents for me and make sure your deeds are filed with the county clerk because\nAt titles not actually conveyed it's not transferred from one person to the other until that need his record it otherwise nobody knows that the property has changed\nAnd when you're doing title insurance when you're doing district that's what you do write your folks are going to be looking at the among other adult county registry transpired of it's not in the county record it never happened I got you okay yeah so just some good good common sense there sadly it's like so many things in life\n[noise] cutting corners is sometimes not a good idea\nRight absolutely and you know you'll you'll come to a point in time where you know you may be able to sell a property for cash 'em and not need to auto insurance but at some point someone is going to want to obtain financing to purchase the property\nAnd lenders will always require a title search and title insurance and so those things will come up later you know possibly for your children that you um you know gave the property\nBut you're trying to really help out but right cause problems for them or ... later on\nIn right so it's better to just do it um you know correctly that first time around and you know that way if there are any problems they can be addressed before the property changes hands and and\nI I never I don't think I've seen a deal where we weren't able to cure the issue and be able to ensure the property I mean obviously sometimes it can get a little challenging but and you know we have some really great underwriters I'm with first national title insurance and\nAnd there's usually a workaround so uh we do our best to you know find a way to tell you yes we don't ever want to tell anyone no we can't\nIs she going to take longer yeah but they're not doing it may be not doing it right the first time means you'll see can be corrected but it may take longer right to make that correction in slow everything down shirt or just do it right basically the\nThe first time now we were talking a little earlier about the things you're looking for when you search and you're looking for things like a divorces strife we're looking who watch a bright\nWe're looking to see 'em so the first thing we look at it it's going to be the deed records so every time the property has changed hands\nWas that the done correct clean 'em did everyone that was supposed to have joined in on the day that everyone sign I'm you know Texas is a a community property state\nI'm also if you have a spouse he resides at the property by her name's not on the day she still has an interest in that property or he um so how did that person join in on a date and\nYou know a lot of things that we we don't necessarily know 'em until we get to this point that we should have done um\nBut we're looking into the you know did I basically did everyone join in on that he that was supposed to ... did the deed correctly described the property by its legal discouraging which every property has the legal description um\nWas it recorded with the county clerk or what type of deal with it there's so many types of days that you can do and some we we can't insure so\nUm that can you know costs some issues beyond that we look for judgments against the property and so and those can range from\nCredit cards child support pack IRS tax liens and property tax liens knowing leans at the ... against the property for you know your grass getting a little out of\nYeah they I mean we handle with us eliminate the closing so when when it's clothing day and it's time to than you know your life away you're going to have you\nPut the pieces together yeah ...\nYeah we're going to we're going to facilitate that we're going to\nHave you come in a sign all the documents explain the document a notarized and for you we're going to facilitate getting that closing package back to the lender we're going to fund alone and we pay all of the fees out we pay the seller we pay their realtor so um\nI mean we're just you know another piece of the closing process but um I don't think a lot of people realize how important that how agency is in bringing all of it together\nAnd really bringing the mixed together right and the executing and making sure it happens so it is more than just saying that that that title is is a clear title is that is of course vitally important but I you're right for you to do some of the mechanics to get everybody in the room at the same record\nThe documents for the work on on um you know like I say on our surveys is needed um we review the surveys to make sure they're acceptable there's a lot of moving parts that go into\nIt and be able to keep track of it right which by the way a dumb question but okay so I buy something in Jefferson County it's recorded in Jefferson County right now you'll want to learn\nIt in that county that it was done in\nYeah okay so so likewise when you're looking around for things or other property it's going to be in the county where the property correct okay that makes that does make sense but ah ah again\nAnd then you may not know until you encounter it or [noise] found it in the wrong county and then came back and realize that later and needed to be followed\nWilling if I'm Egyptian Johnny I'm buying property or in other counties maybe an investor butter ridge going to be file their right but I'm Still going to be a resident\nOf this ... I can see where eventually could be a little confused as you're searching see again part of what you do can become a little more a confusing at times in while you have those skills folks in the back room looking over All right so\nThat's our job you know we want to make the closing process just mood for everybody at the lender the buyer and seller the realtors um\nBudget emotional time to say that sort of the ah that that's a that's when I guess you'd say the rubber meets the road you've done all this stuff you've talked about it you've done this stuff you've had these things you already imagining where to put the sofa yeah you're seeing yourself in the whole what you want on that day\nIs a nice move closing and I have heard stories from others would\nMay be out of town mortgage companies were used on line mortgage that what he's got all sorts of other topics were when they get to closing and it doesn't work so smoothly\nAnd that's where of capital title and many of our final Angola lenders and realtors will make it works smoothly for you\nThat's that's the goal at the end of the day is just to you know provide excellent customer service across the board to all of our clients realtors lenders a buyer seller team ever we're dealing with and and to make sure that\nYou know again you're receiving Claire taught that property that you don't run into any hiccups later when you go to sell the property\nAnd it's\nYou know it can be it can be a process for some people I've heard horror stories about lenders and that type of thing but um you know our goal is the day of the closing we just you know want to make it a a great experience\nWith you and your hand and you can go right to check out the new home you owned by the way when you do that closing or both parties present or do you normally sign one party and then sign the other\nYou know it really depends um when I first started in this industry ... it seemed like everybody all signed at the same time but um since then\nSome laws and gone into place where the documents are separate now by the documents are separate from selling so you're discussing kind of financial details and a lot of people\nYou know aren't really comfortable with somebody may sign and we may not currently under but whatever preference as we can accommodate\nOkay and you can close in in a year to both of our modern or any of the all ... it is ten fifty to a new drug five six details vi\nWhen your banquet community bag of Texas you experienced all the things you want from a business bank and none of the things you don't hear

uh that's the great thing I think about bill ... capital title again he really invest in the community really look for opportunities to make our area\nJust as great as it can be\n... or early ... billion office just for you there and be Joni actually use a great a convenience for folks because we have a lot of real estate transactions in mid county a lot going on\nAnd you don't have to drive to bowl monitor drive to our in our capital tidal now those transactions can be taken to\nA country place right there's really you're within probably\nTwenty minutes of anybody in the golden trying out all uh and that makes it a very very convenience oriented item as we were talking about all the er I like to be able to go and sit across the desk from you and ask questions makes it convenient to visit and get these things taking care off before the actual closing\nRight yeah I mean You're welcome to walk into any\nOur offices and um you know find out you know what what will the fees be my wanted to sell his property I'm you know is there somebody you can direct to meet you to help me with this process a realtor\nUm so you don't mind discussing fees if somebody you all at all not convenient and I assume that it's based on the road vowed may ... rice\nBut all of the other fees and our say we have set the so we could we could give you a very estimated idea of what you're going to pay to sell the property or\nPeace of mind for a lot of research you if you don't do this very often\nAnd you're lost and I always I mean you talk to the guys with capital title\nDo they ask the fellow at the supermarket uh you know don't do all that because sometimes you get all sorts of weird advice or you can ah ... again ... street advice committed so important in sometimes which people's mind at ease when you just sort of talk through what your piece of that process is going to be\nYeah absolutely we're here to help in any way that we can and if for some reason we can't help you we will find somebody who can so\nI'm you know whether it be you know a transaction that you will use the title agency for not um you know we want to make sure that you do it the right way so if we can navigate through that process or direct you to somebody who can help you with it a real estate attorney or or whatever the case may be we'd love to do that and you know just to\nWhat are you able to contracts they're just they're not you'll do thing for most of us went into about selling abused property I'm ready to call so you got to come in and talk to you and you've got some contractually ... almost out of time but we've we've talked a lot about residential property and such but if I'm simply buying\nSo this hour I'm going to pick up a couple of things about how not to kill plants are from this guy a tape boats with us from the Jefferson County agra life extension service and good morning sir hey good morning how are you sir and I'm doing great or maybe a lot to kill the tree or per the grass or\nI don't know I I seem to be a professional look at a killing things some jibes\nAnd I guess we all feel that way sometimes because of this to we have such a varying whether in southeast Texas we get busy with baby neglect something or\nOr a ... that we have too much rain too little rain too much heat too little heat or it's it's always something when it comes to growing outdoors isn't it\nIt has been recently um with our weather here you know that definitely has been one of the determining factor in whether you know your plants may live live another day or if they kind of struggle to survive this week so uh it's definitely been a roller coaster for the weather this year\nAnd you've got to watch that very carefully don't you in just a\nShort of no a no win do water when not to water 'em and and some of the range we've had have been a really a ... almost torrential and may not last long but almost torrential is that emphasize the importance\nOf civil raised beds are getting things up around here\nAbsolutely absolutely um [noise] working out here in southeast Texas especially if you have a some clay saw\nEspecially down along the coast where we're at um you definitely run into some saturated soles of especially some of these ... that tend to hold water just a little bit longer um and that can run into some serious issues with a plant staying a wet too long\nSo like I said if you're doing raised beds um you're you're already a step ahead of the game um the further north you go into our area you have a little more sand and so maybe not as much but uh still a good idea you can always ... a lot easier if you have raised beds and up overall it's just a good practice\nGood practice in that does sound like probably a foolish question so how do I raised a bit [noise] uh well what's the best simplest way to do that\nSeveral different methods to raise your bed or\nIf you can elevate your soil I can be easy as if you're working in your garden to heal your garden with your Taylor or your tractor I'm just creating some raised rose actually will be beneficial in the long run I'm planning on the on the race tales number one basically get those roots two to three inches above the ah\n... existing swollen and planning on top of the hills always is an easy thing to do um\nIf not if I Can't do that do I need to uh put some sort of border to put my soil and so it doesn't just dissipate a lot of people\nDo um they we will try to contain our soul especially we've had to purchase or bring in some existing soil ... amendments a lot of times the amendments or you know kind of getting pricey sometimes and depending on how much you bring in 'em and you need a way to control them keep them from Washington to your neighbors your right\nChose ... looks so nice and then you get the heavy rain and you were raised bed is you're flat bed a lot of times that\nDoes seem to happen down here um easiest way to do that is to contain it like you said with a a border and that can be a brick stone rock I'm\nJust really basically anything that you have I've seen several different methods use 'em a lot of people here will use cinder blocks um they're kind of impervious to the weather ... um cross ties are okay um\nYou can use the landscape timbers or I'm just about anything that really you know we'll complementary yard and and the aesthetic some some make it fit your yard um why people will use the decorative stones to a known 'em up so there's just like I said I variety of choices as to the containment\nBut as long as you can get that Seoul and us plants you know six to eight inches above the existing grade you're doing much better\nOkay and a six to eight inches\nYeah it doesn't have to be ah you know two or three feet lot of people think just enough to get the uh top six to eight inches of roots out of that uh we call them that top zone which is basically the top two or three inches of the existing hop soul um anything above that um will be you know drawing much better\nOkay and so that that's a real number one ... was actually going to help you out so when we do get these little southeast Texas torrential downpours may last twenty minutes but his put enough water there\nThat it's going to stand so that's going to take care of of that and also then if you have bought some other things to put in that bed sort of protect that from a from washing away exactly okay so what's our next steps we we do that we've got the bad raised\nJust have to monitor things to see OK as dry as would wet what do I do\nAbsolutely huge do not want to especially if you're in a gardening situation to work a overly wet soil um you can actually do more damage to the soul ... and it's wet I'm a little more is okay um\nYou've kind of had found that happy medium you don't want to work at when it's super super dry um did you tend to pulverized a lot of soul materials\nBut on the other end of the scale if you try to work a wet soil it's going to clump together and make clumps and then that's going to fit your purpose so found that happy medium I'm In working your soul a little more she's okay obviously you know the day after a two inch rain we might want to wait a while\nBut um you know just as long as you can work it and it's not a sticky or it's not a ... a powder from lack of water you should be OK\nWell really by utilizing those raised beds is going to help it to drive fast or too is just it's not going to get that are almost gumbo or that or just muddy consisted correct\nThe or the water tends to drink faster and especially if you've added amendments that aid in and drainage such as a little sand or anything that has like an\nAggregate type material or pine bark or any of your most\nMaterials self word I add the sand dry headed towards the bottom or do I just put it in that are just mix it in with the dirt\nI'm the best of them if you're adding a material such as maybe you're sixty forty new law in a garden a lot of people like to add the sixty forty and that does help and drainage somewhat um the best thing is to take your existing soil that you haven't you raised bed\nAnd to spread it evenly about one or two inches on top and then uh either ... or basically makes it by hand you can take a shovel and do it um but as long as you're mixing that and getting a good consistency a\nMixture it's kinda like a cake mix you don't want lumps in there and you don't want a clumps and you're in your lawn and you're just ... exactly but a good even mixture all the way through and that distributes you're a material all the way through the top of the bottom\nOkay that makes sense so just again do something where it's going to be evenly distributed through there and when you're really good to go in\nThat act actually that is a good idea you're good to go as long as you've got a good even mixture\nThe they're right along in Fifteen Years John five sixty kale vi\nRegarding portion of my whole

Belmont and if that's not enough then you can stop buying and get some plants and go home and plant some uh well I don't know should you it is been awfully wet the last week we were talking earlier about raised beds but\nWhat can we do for some folks it's gotta be hard to even mobile right\nNow they drew I'm obviously we need to uh you know look at our individual you know lots and you know areas where we're mowing are doing are gardening\nUm just use your best judgment um if you walk across and he goes ... probably a little too wet I'm given a day or two maybe the sun will come out to the next couple of days and dried out more\nBut that you don't want to like obviously ... when it's wet or work you're gardener your vegetables or even your five minutes when they're when they're too where you can actually end up doing a little bit of damage to your so also give them a day or two let 'em dry out and then I'm thinking about doing all that default planning\nNow you mentioned that earlier certainly be careful with the uh gardening yes but it's also just be careful because once you've shorter rounded up the yard with your ... or whatever\nThat is going to be hard to deal with plus you can sink enough you end up scalping yard if you're not careful have you learned a little spot and and then are the equipment and those that equipment is the longer inexpensive you can cause some damage to\nThe border or equipment it's just ... I Know it's frustrating but it's really not worth it just wait a few days\n... give it a couple of days and then go out there and tackle those outdoor project\nAnd if I'm Greg forecast what he's saying hopefully will come to pass is that we could see some drier times coming up later\nThis week that looks like a disturbance or in the Gulf will probably develop further and go north and when it goes north it's going to in essence bring\nA lot of I'm worst year that direction dry us out in probably result in ... and cooler temperatures I think we're already ... hey we all are so we could really ready for some kook temperatures drier cooler air by the end of the week so maybe that'll be time to uh to get out and um and and do more of your\nLawn and and gardening now this time of the year we were talking about gardening is rise up what should I be doing because I never thought about a fall garden ... guys on the show wasn't gardening is spring well you know in the fall you can do almost as much in the fall and a lot of people here do prefer the fall\nGardening season even though it is a little bit shorter a little bit tighter timeframe I'm your insect and disease I'm\nIssues are much less oh well come simply because it's not as hot number one um you have a a more compact growing season um yes you will still have a few issues here and there but uh the major\nInsect and disease or issues are not as prevalent so a lot of people find it more enjoyable um you know trying to get a a crop of say for example tomatoes in versus you know in the U.S brings\nAnd when you've got such a good window in the springtime but then the flip of a ... year tomato seeds and can be over by um you know insects or disease and it doesn't take long in the summertime poem just to kind of you know where\nThey're down so what would I planted in the fall again just about a you'd mentioned tomatoes tomatoes are a great option here in the fall when I started planting I'm right now here in within you know truly week limited dries up ...\nAnd of course you know you're limited on your tomatoes selection you need to find a a variety that is a determinant selection which basically means they don't mature in you know I set timeframe um and obviously that's going to be about sixty two Seventy five days I'm\nSo anything before first I Do have a narrow window what is our first frost you usually\nOoh I'm On paper it's usually about the second or third week in November um but of course you know who knows who knows Mother Nature kind of as a curve ball um but usually plan on one or much cooler weather toward the end of December\nSo I mean something if you had to produce basically get a breeze pretty quick\nAbout uh sixty two a Seventy five day a window on what we call determinant tomatoes and those are going to be you know a lot of your your smaller Bush type tomatoes now you're ones that you normally can plan in the spring that\nSeem to keep growing and maybe get six or seven foot tall you kind of want to stay away from those in the fall unless you've started I'm fairly early um you're not going to have enough time for a good crop\nOkay and and again that could very so you need something it's going to be fit in that ... you may not have Seventy five day correct\nCorrect and um and then of course you can start looking at your your winter type of ah crops such as your ... your ... your cabbage is a lot of people like to do carrots down here\nAnd uh if the weather is is a cooperative enough you can even get away with doing some lettuce is um you can do quite a bit of your lettuce is here um when it gets cool enough\nUm and fruit wise um strawberries are always a good choice I'm a lot of people like to put their strawberries in in October a mid October or so um and that way you can start harvesting them fairly early in the last season I would've never guess that mhm strawberries are great um\nOf course you know that it's a little more work involved um to get a better crop you need to obviously put them in a raised bed um and if you plant them you know give them some type of ... so that they don't the fruit when it does develop doesn't a lay on the ground

lot of programs we were just talking about some of the things coming up with a master gardeners who's running out of time in that segment I didn't want to add when you were talking about master gardeners\nThat people may not understand just how much training they have this is not a I don't just put on some genes been kept out and volunteer there were these master gardeners are men and women have put it in a lot of hours of study\nAbsolutely um we uh to become a master gardener course she didn't have to go to a educational a component and it is a we call it are short course in the spring um\nIt's about fifty hours of a what we call classroom education it's a combination of a lecture 'em on site off site and then we do a lotta we're going to a lot of hands on\nHim stuff this year so we're we're going to try to incorporate a you know quite a bit of hands on and we always still the hands on his best but you're going to have at least a fifty hours of a classroom education\nPlus there are new master gardeners that are going through our program are required to contribute you know quite a bit of a hands on time to activities\nWorking in the garden or other miscellaneous activities so ah and then of course they have to do some educational as well so it's a a pretty intense and of course but uh\nWe think the information that you gain from it is invaluable um you know just for the average homeowner I'm that doesn't know much um you know we hope that they walk away with a better understanding of agriculture and especially horticulture know in our area what\nDo I have to do to be a master gardener is or any sort of pre qualification I Know you have the courses in such a who is this open to\nThe master gardener program is open to anybody that's interested I'm so like I said to our application\nForms actually on our website um ... low Jefferson ... dot org excuse me um if you're interested um\nYou know you might check out our Web site and we'll let you if you're curious I'm always visit with one of our our\nPrevious previous I'm Sorry our current master gardeners and um they can kind of the the ins and outs and uh you know that might be something that you're interested in\nBut it's a good group of volunteers that we have and their goal like I said is to help promote\nA agar life extension activities whether that be through master gardener activities uh you know in public and then you know public speaking so uh there's something for everybody I'm we feel like in the metropolitan organization\nNow what if I have no knowledge whatsoever\nAs fun we venture okay we'll take any level of a of a knowledge of a lot of people get in there and realized that they have a certain passion for say\nRoses and if you do then we will direct you and you know you you can take specialized training and roses um so you can become proficient at rose is um\nIf you don't have to have any because you know I Know what I consider myself with a green thumb and here I don't know what I'm doing a those courses would teach me from around ... absolutely\nUm we we start with the basics and we make sure everybody knows the basics on you know for example roses and then um\nI have several master gardeners that um are very good at roses are that they're passionate interest up\nCould care less about a a platoon you're paying the at rose is you know that's that's all they live for so we have a lot of of interest in 'em you know different types of plants so if you're interested in any type of horticulture we can uh you know ... activities

B. C. is out in the ... of our activities or bring your samples with you will love to or may not get to him right that moment but we'll sure uh you know be glad to take a look at\nThings I also like about what are you guys do is you do a lot of research\nYou don't necessarily recommend a brand name but you will recommend a particular a typical or product that you may find it a number of different brands your material is really tested when you recommend something just because you guys have have used it\nAbsolutely um we try and ... strictly very hard to provide non biased research you're being paid for by double up on you know in the ... um we tried to like I said it's very non biased um if we recommend a product\nWe're going to give you the the scientific name and then I'm going to give you five or six examples so you made the decision but we'll give you the product that we think works best for a certain application and I'll say you're here you're three or four choices that I Know that you can get local you're where you can get them from\nAnd let you go from there but or any of our products that we recommend or like I said had been tested tried um specifically for this region and across the state as well so you know we're we're going to have very specific information for you know specific plants that we uh or issues that we might come up against\nHim of show important because many times who say nine out of ten of you know guard is regulated in the X Y Z\nBecause it's not electricity that we all think we can do right up to we started doing it which brings us up dry gas\nWhich probably gets many a call from somebody who says\nHey I'm In the middle of this it's broken I Need like a real professional uh Josh ship paid is with us\nFrom uh south east Texas plumbing and they're going to happen and thanks for coming in a little closer to the Mike there thank you for coming in ... and I guess you do get a few of those calls because we all think we know more than we do about plumbing and uh\nHey I'll just take the ranch and give it a good twist\n... hopes are there is a reason why you guys are professionals\nAnd the and I'm not and uh I I just nothing probably interrupts the house sold more than\n... water Oh absolutely nobody is happy there always seems to happen when it happens to me also when I've got the maximum number of kids president and the sink is full of dishes and the clothes they have to be washed for tomorrow\nAnd it's a school day and then there's no uh do water so I'm never fun situation\nBut uh is it true I guess a lot of the issues we have with plumbing when you really stop to think about it like our cars in so many other things we had warning we get a warning\nThere's a problem a lot of times whether it'd be a a faucet or whatever don't Oh yes absolutely we sell the toilet we just were not paying attention or we ignore it\nThat's right Yes sir and I can agree there and you know or the signs are there and look for corrosion under the cabinets wet spot is usually when our son I'm ... and we would start getting a slow during this stuff started bubbling a little bit and then something's going on that's the time to call\nBecause of course middle of the night like you said everybody's getting ready for bed getting ready for school the next day that's when everything is going to break and go haywire and then you're not an agonizing\nYeah every everybody is unhappy yeah that's a good point that there are symptoms for instance from the drain you started having things drain slowly or seems to be a problem are now many times I guess if you're in an area where maybe heavy rain and suddenly you have a problem\nThat could mean something outside was a short piper something again don't wait\nA jolt the whole trees grown into your store\nWhere we can we see a lot of that here in Beaumont especially here recently with all the heavy rain\nIn Beaumont do we still haven't and uh we have various a waste a pipe ... today you would use PVC what'd you yeah that's what the the uh connecting to the shores PVC but one time we used to play\nBy play in concrete there's also Orangeburg that still exist in his area\nOh okay now we face those out ah for P. B. C. but\nThere is a lot of places that still have those down and say Oh yes yeah especially over here in the south into town still a lot of that old plumbing still there\nAre so I was still works someone's been maintained it still works but some of it doesn't work too well and and it was a certain point you've got to consider replacing Yes sir Yes sir sometimes it's just beyond repair it's time to just go and dig it up and put something else down\nWell that's one of those issues to where I I suspect a lot of times people may not totally understand when you come out to make a repair you're making repair\nTo today's standards aren't you you you can't go back and do it if if this is a forty year old home a fifty year old home\nYou can't do it like it was we have new rules now in place just certainly do so you're going to have to come back in and uh um put that into I guess it's a code the codes change yes there are the couch more or less the same and all the city's\nUh yes there is some variations from city to city more of you know their particular wants and needs I'm much pretty much in my opinion the the standard what everybody round here primarily uses\nUm you get into some of the other places they have you know particular way they want some stuff done um but usually not that big a deal they all pretty much go off the same code book run by the same rules that are just some little different awareness is that they have that other cities don't so you know we just\n[noise] and there's a plumber as a licensed former obviously you've got to follow those rules\nOh yes sir absolutely everything we do get inspected by the city ... uh in in you know sometimes we do run into things that we're not sure about code was ... the city inspectors down there they're real helpful for that and we just call them and then they kind of tell us how to proceed if we're not sure what to do with it and and just take it that route\nThat's something I think sometimes it's an interesting point you are making a get a Josh champagne with a\nA southeast Asia's plumbing our guest this hour he's that I think a lot of people are afraid of the inspectors are are don't don't want to say I don't like the inspectors around this or that are there really there to help you as you say you could call them and they can help clarify rule or a particular situation\nI absolutely I think there are there more to protect the consumer and the homeowner I'm than anybody I mean you know sometimes they you can think their mental hard but in the long run each protecting you you've ever resell the home you have that to say I did do it right this is what I did I had inspected\nI was just had a a a ... title Kennedy person on first hour but I have real ... on the show frequently and that is a good point at home inspectors and that is if it isn't done right you may think you got away with something\nBut you really don't when you go to sell a house or the appraiser in the home inspector the realtor all sorts of people are going to say that I look right\nUh so it is better just to do it the right way the first time I absolutely agree yeah I mean that seems to me to be the smartest way to do it\nAnd this is the rules have changed over the years so when you go to replace that plumbing or you go to replace the of the shore or a water heater it's got to be done the way it needs to be done today Oh yes it has to be you know to to car plumbing coach standards\nIs sometimes thinking particularly of water heaters a lot has changed with him\nOh yes the technology is way beyond what it was ten years ago\nSo that means a different kind of install\nOh absolutely yes um you know and and now days into tankers water heaters the new upcoming thing um which are very good very safe you know but they're also very smart um but there are so many variations of that here in every installer so much different from the next so you know there's\n... when it comes down to those codes a really big thing is to stick to him to follow and you know also to manufacture a has their specific ways they want to install so it'll\nWork correctly I Gotcha when Jake bringing come back and talk a little about those changes heaters because\nFew years ago that was something people just\nWe had very little conversation about it but now they're being installed more and more often in and kicked in a retrofit brings up some interesting issues twelve Fifteen at news talk five sixty kale vi on on news talk five sixty kill vi kill the dot com and I heard radio\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nTwelve Eighteen used five sixty kill the eyes we continue our plumbing conversation and Josh should have been a good point a moment ago we were talking about coach that how you obviously when you go back with the repair or whatever have to do it to today's standards but you also mentioned the tank was water seizures and\nIt's very interesting to me a gun show for several years and that was sort of a novelty item at one time and now it is becoming\nA really a a more and more of a standard item in southeast Texas I mean you might first explain for those who are not aware the regular water heater a okay the tank fills up against the burner at the bottom are the the the Raj or whatever in there they're going to have the water\nAnd I keep the water heated right Jill I Need it right during the ... so I'm eating a lot of all the time we're getting explains a tank list water heater\nWell the tankers water heater is only going to turn on when you need to demand you turn off faucet then it actually lights and it it\nYou know it gives you hot water gives you as much as you need ... depending on so you're never going to run out you're never going to run out heating water okay you know and they were very efficiently and they've got some now that are extremely efficient and you know to the point they use PBC for the exhaust\nThe exhaust is so cool it's it's it's colder than a drive in so it ... all the all the gas available to very very efficient\nNow you said gas do they come and gas and electric or mainly gas or is there one that is better than the other\nGas is definitely better than any of the electrical electrical is there's some good products out there and but when you get into electricity own type was water heaters you're talking they're pulling a hundred and twenty ... ... and that's a lot of power so if you're trying to um\nYou know have energy as a factor here and you're trying to save on that side of it sometimes electric tankers are not exactly a good way to go because they do pull a lot of electricity\nSo it might be just as simple to have an electric your regular tanked eater in there that's just going to keep the water\nOr hot all the time that you you don't have as much efficiency for now the gas water heaters that that is amazing so that's got to be a lot of um a lot of heat [laughter] to be able to instantaneously and the heat the water\nNo we just need to take that as far as it out\nYou know when we go into putting a new faucets we we try to explain the labor to install that false it's the same no matter which falls that you you so now is really the time to get one that's going to last Fifteen or Twenty years\nVersus one that may not last but four or five years in your back to install another direct and go with a good brand you know we we actually you know we recommend a few different brands that we actually carry parts for ... um and you know we try to get people to do with those is there is a problem it's not over there in part is just we come out and we fix it and it's you know and you're back in business\nYeah I've gotten in that situation before where the faucet was so off brand that nobody has apart for it so you ended up having to pull the faucet anyway just really good money after bad uh it is twelve thirty an update from Fox News on news dot five sixty K.

the week that would be delighted to uh to see that\nAre right now we're talking with Joshua champagne from uh the uh south east Texas a plumber just ah working everywhere in southeast taxes plenty of plumbing work to do I know because right now do you guys do new construction a yes or we do because lots of new construction going on\nIs amazing to me have a huge destruction is going on\nOh yes or there's lots of married going on there's there's also a lot of remodeling still going on from you know from Harvey your true so seeing a lot of that and and everybody's busy on it but yes the new construction is definitely growing um we do more of the commercial new construction in residential and and both sides are there's a boom and right now\nYou mentioned Harvey ... and I've had folks shown in recent weeks talking about the recovery from Harvey and I was lucky enough to\nNot have any particular damage you come back and you you go back to work and and you think well OK lives normal it isn't for so many people have so many friends that were displaced and many of them just now getting back to their homes it's been a very very long process\nAnd I'm told by some people that they're still folks\nThat have the walls opened up in er figuring out what to do both if you're in that situation and you want to change anything plumbing why's this would be the time to do it wouldn't it if you're if you're at that stage where it's still just studs would you always wanted something else do it now\nLike I was saying and we get free estimates and we've been out to several of these homes and you know where the walls are open our honest they now is that she'd been out of time you're never going to have another opportunity to like you have right now\nTo do this and we also offer a we have the ability to camera this labs one we're there to check the sewer lines on to this lab 'cause right now is the best time to deal with that okay um\nOthers no floor while there's no walls I never thought of that and and we do have sewer line problem under slabs in southeast Texas ...\nOh yes sir especially with you know like the rain from Harvey was saying a lot of houses that shifted and moved and because dark that it never really been wet was suddenly under three or four foot of water have\nNever thought about that boy that that is a new one on me I never thought so you can actually have been okay and then I have a shoreline problem under that slab because everything just shifted around yes wow wow\nI I Know one building I'm familiar with where we didn't catch it for a long time and time they had a guy tell me that had not seen it a while to do you notice the space them lead doors different we realize that whole building had shifted a little bit so it it does happen now's the time to do it\nVery very calm and definitely have that in this area after after Harvey we've probably seen more damage out to this lab than we ever imagined and we also seen a lot of debris that was ... down the lines are and Harvey um\nWell I Know particularly in the seals marry some areas I'm familiar with out in the village creek and such\nI the water was running so swift so I understand what you're saying you yes you had water rising and that's not good but in many cases you had such swiftly running water\nAnd it was just shifting things around so any questions about the plumbing any questions if you are one of those that have a button things back up yet and you guys don't mind coming out giving an estimate looking at things with the camera making sure everything's okay\nOh yes when we get done before you put sheet rock up we like to make sure everything's working we tend to everything fully so that way when you do get ready to get back in the house you can move back and when they hit you know problems everything works just like it should just like new\nWell that's the thing too is that new many cases you're going to replace fixtures and such because you're ... redoing the house basically but also if there's some ah plumbing and those walls that's weak or has a problem you can go and get it replaced\nBecause the last thing I suspect who vote is a leak you got all this work done and then you end up with a leak six months down the road and your cherry out sheet rock and having to\nDo again it's it's really not expensive to run a few test a tech check the integrity of say the water lines in the sewer lines and you know a few hundred dollars there and go a long way you know ... once you get the house sealed backup\nYeah the ... is not going to stop for a few hundred dollars when you got to start sharing things out and redoing that data\nIt'll cause that to get him to put the brakes off and get out of the truck so yeah just and I unfortunately I think many of us are that way we are a little foolish when it comes to spending a little extra money for some testing and the safety and then later on hope we don't get caught but if you do suddenly you're spending\nMore money or later and you also mentioned these older subdivisions and such in town is is more and more people I Know\nI have friends that live in the old town section of Beaumont they they like some of those older homes\nBut boy set bring older problems with plumbing and such and inevitably you need to have that checked it and maybe I Would say if you're having no problem getting a check to any way to see what's gonna happen down the road and start a little money aside see what your priorities ought to be\nIn that never hurts his you know sometimes we can look at something and see a problem it's gonna happen within a year or two and then you can think about how you're going to fix and and sometimes they'll find a problem that would be a big problem really like you know flood house it causes erosion of the house from a badly\nThey right now just to drift off we find it now well then we can to address that problem and it could save thousands", "show_name":
