to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before again like she woke up my father was there\nHe came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom sooner or later kissed or who said honey everything's going to be All right both beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and it was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm these sometimes these stories are just emotional issue will they bring to\nYeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's\nThese aren't negative experiences for the most part if in in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years you know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye\nWas saying you know it's okay um you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and\nThey reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one ... and these are important things in life we talked about before it

it's good to join the Bronx I chose to go ahead George how are you know Joe\nGood a brand and yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe you relate a story about a ... a British and I've seen um [noise]\n... um the question is do you think that there is a supplemental under channels of communication going on between ... and the recipient of the ghost experience\nUm maybe perhaps

a ... before you have the extra and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question well good so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know without the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench and he finds the pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with a complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation so you resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd I and when you resonate with something it's not just information it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there is one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and he has this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog you know laying in the water and injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow\nFeel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication
