that is that rock\nThat's not human stone that is actually the original hills that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has in senior ate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on the in this three locations and they were aligned to you know the belt stars of a Ryan a dating to step peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom are Egyptians came they basically built
