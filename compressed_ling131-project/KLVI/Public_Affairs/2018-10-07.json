L. joined us now as we explore southeast Texas issues with news and sports director heroin man\nWe're doing a welcome you to this week's access program on the seventh day of October two thousand Eighteen as always thank you so much for taking part of your day to take part in our public affairs program\nCan you believe there's odds in betting on who's gonna win certain offices with more ... than in from America in the morning which was aired weekday mornings between for a human ... until we are\nA very important mid term election how's it going to go well you can find a billions of plenty out there\nAnd uh certainly that would include even the the organized betting industry we are talking with David Strauss gives me had odds maker at my ... age gee that's an empty ... a website\nAnd uh when you're not doing things like football or boxing matches and the like are you are actually do things on politics is politics a big area of wage ring\nOr it is on the presidential election and the ... much like people hopefully like to get out there a cast their vote they liked it back their candidate as ... dollars as well\nInteresting I'm not sure that there are there are restrictions of course on on sports betting in some states rather restrictions on on political betting if you will\nA wallet a sort of all falls under the same umbrella but ah as we are places by the country of ... and the world Trade Organization has ruled that a factor of ... is allowed to take the sort of access of America players\nOr will it will take that bet whether the NFL whether all its it whether you also forever every single state in the union\nAll right now that are based on your er best odds maker objective opinion what are your thoughts about what's going to happen here of course we have the Republicans with a\nA twenty three vote margin in the house currently which is exactly the margin that in recent elections the presidential party has tended to are losing their first midterms and of course in the Senate\nTo vote margin although of the thirty three seats up in the Senate\nThis time around twenty five are Democrats were the two independents who vote as Democrats and only eight Republicans so of ah of the the two sets of circumstances there what do you feel are the ... of the Democrats taking the house or the Democrats taking the Senate\nOr I guess I should preface this by saying that I have a frequently wrong on this one I favor the Republicans to take the Senate and keep control the house\nThe betting public disagrees with us wholeheartedly uh we are facing losses grab a craftsman take it back based on my restrict are based on my field or this sort of thing are Republicans will still pull it off\nIs this based at all on the fact that traditionally those groups which tend to vote Republican just frankly turn out more than those who tend to vote democratic\n... I mean Republicans not to put down the Democrats or Republicans seem to perform their civic duty a little bit better or they come out and throws especially middle America or in a voting is as a rite of passage\nMarketing your driver's license and a Republican households tend to feel safe or sat on their you to get out there and do their duty\nAs you look at the various issues there one thing of course of the polls tend to be pretty good in the polls bully methodology is really in recent years\nHas a a lifetime of let's put it this way the last time a poll\nReally significantly blew a major race was in Nineteen thirty six when the uh the polls\nAre released one poll literary digest poll said that alf Landon would beat a Franklin Roosevelt of course a lavish carried two states to forty six for Roosevelt and other recent elections for example of the poster showed a narrowing gap between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\nThe polls showed a very tight race for example in two thousand between Al Gore and George W. Bush so the technology has or the methodology I guess it has tended to be pretty good but there's a problem now\nAnd that problem is that they used to be that you could look at an area code and an exchange and you could tell right where that person lived\nBut cell phones you're not tied to geographic areas so it's awfully hard I think these days for pollsters using telephone numbers to pick a representative sample\nThat is very true I mean you can\nYou can guess with your with your cell phone number of the area code words are still ... of us around the area but it it is a much larger area that what it was in the past does that affect the actors in the polls probably slightly\nBut then what the ... and the way that people express their opinion is that way you know they're sort of a an on going poll the American public that happens every day on social media\nDavid drowsy hit odds maker at my book the dot H.

that's a unique event hogs and strings a\nFestival a unique organization unique facility and unique event is the steamboat museum is hosting their Boy Scout day which uh once\nOnce a year you do this right yeah I got there wells in Studio to talk about yeah\nSo we usually do it in the spring but this year we um like like so many things got pushed back because of the word I just couldn't get it together for the springtime so we're here and we're doing it on October thirteenth and it will be from nine in the morning till one o'clock\nAnd it is free event for scouts and their family um it is tailored to that the boy scout American heritage merit badge and so they can come and they can get a a huge portion of that merit badge worked on while they're there one of the parts that they have to a ... interview citizens and so we have a great of\nA field of citizens that they can interview we have um mayor Becky aims will be there for them to interview a former FBI agent veterans many just different people um that are going to share about that important American heritage right here in southeast Texas or excited to have\nThat a great service yes and so we love 'em just all the of the community that has partnered with us to to give back to these these scouts and we visit the age group can can so in addition to the older boys\nWill be working towards the American heritage and even though the younger ones may not be working towards that they can still participate in in those interviews and get something out of those that don't offer them ready for something that yeah he'll do in the future rag and they'll also have in a one of our larger buildings we have\nA Cub Scout activity set up throughout and so on and then just for fun we have um candy snakes is now candy critters will have her friends out there um and they will be doing a meet and greet so they can come up and I'm ...\nThat the snake um some people like to hold them I'm more of just to touch while she holds um but she'll you're better than me I just want it at all or from afar yet she's wonderful she really meet you where you are so if your lives are by far she you get away with a snake and keep walking with me as so we do have that we of course there'll be lunch served\nUm and this is a completely free event at first scouts and their families I haven't even mentioned you have this amazing exhibit they're heavily yeah I guess to a collection of gotten him or millionaire yes it definitely is and so we have our\nUm scouts at exhibit in the museum but also throughout the museum there's Easter eggs so there's different scouting items in all throughout the museum so ... so they're going to get to do it again in your mind and these items are hidden\nAll the time so this isn't just for that so they're always in just the ... behind view and it really just showcases how different people that scouting\nAt relationship translated so directly into their success as an adult so different successful southeast Texas people we have exhibits up had a little scout item hidden in there that really special and they'll get a patch if they complete that in addition to working towards the mayor badge they can also get that patch\nThat they can they can absorb information about it you know historic figures in southeast heck yeah and that's that's really great and it's just it's just that Monday yeah sat on a Sunday and then of\nCourse is a come and go so if you're there so much going on so if you are I'm meeting to go get some gumbo that day to go get some gumbo come do some scouting and you can you can do it all in southeast Texas and so that's one of the things that's really great about how how were structured hears and everybody's so collaborative that\nThat's so true and that's yeah I recommend that get your gumbo didn't come to your scout thing or vice versa exactly make it all happened in one day\nYeah you've got some other things going on yeah you want to mention that because the following week we have another free event and it is for our teachers it's art teacher appreciation at the clip didn't seem that museum and so we have we love our teachers they get to come to the museum\nBut so often when they get to come to the museum they come with their whole class and so they had eighty students and so they may or may not get to enjoy the museum so this is a day just for the teachers and we have wine and cheese for the teachers I so they can come they can enjoy the day\nAnd they can enjoy the museum but we also have a door prizes and in the past we've uh every teacher's left with a door prize at so it's a great fun thing and and so again our local community right service yes and we at the swag bag they live with a door prize\nUm they have wine and cheese and they get to relax and enjoy the museum\nWill and I think too that if the teacher has never been out to the museum this will be an opportunity for her to see\nHow appropriate would be to then bring students that can explore the museum and then ... you know\nRight arm and if it's a great place to bring yes and we're so ... that I write of him ... regardless of what you may teach there's something

R. A. accounts\nAnd use all your saved accumulated money to fund what they wanted to call a universal pension fund and blended into the Social Security system and then doling out to you is they decided\nObama and the Democrats after they successfully created Obamacare had pension and four O. one K. seizure next some their list but were unable to do it when the Republicans captured the house in\nTwenty Gen listen you don't want to hear you didn't hear about that during those days when that was going on we were reporting it to you but you didn't read about it in the newspapers you didn't hear about it on the network news broadcast on television\nThey actually had that all cooked up and if the ...

Fox News that Kavanaugh has been confirmed that the next Supreme Court justice but some Democrats are hinting they'll continue to try to learn more about the sexual misconduct allegations against can\nWell and certainly you know in today's world with uh the advances in technology medical technology that you know there's a lot more people that survive these ah these wars with some terrible lenders injuries but it doesn't necessarily or\nThe pain can continue and I'm sure that can be both psychological and physical\n... and one of the things that the statistics show is that that a military veterans have a much higher rate in fact thirty percent higher rate of suicide than the general population so people that have an addiction problem a lot of times they don't see any other solution then hurting themselves and and we're here to offer an alternative to that\nAnd some recent statistics say that there's twenty two veterans a day that commit suicide and so I'm just it's reasonable to assume that many of those have a problem with addiction and don't know any other answer and so we want to be able to be a solution for that\nAnd certainly that's part of the medical part is monitoring them on a daily basis looking for signs and symptoms of aren't going to pressure on going to sit down and dressing those commented along with you know the the toss it so\nWell I certainly appreciate y'all are getting involved in this and also being able to uh this is a grant so is the services free to to the veterans\nIt's completely free so if anybody amazed it it is there's there's nothing like it this is the first grade of its type in Texas um it's completely funded through Texas veterans commission\nWe don't even ask for an insurance card or the only thing that we asked for is there for vacation that the person served in the military they don't even have to be an honorable discharge will take any kind of discharge so even if they had a problem with this issue in the military and got discharged from the military because of that it doesn't accept them from the service so we're able to offer it to so many people that really need it\nWell and you know I Would imagine you know getting the word out one of the hard thing to do because it's ... it's not something that is fun to talk about the\nMental health issues and certainly addiction issues\nThere is probably very few families that hadn't been touched in one way or another are and you know it's people want to move through it quickly and it's not something that you know it often haunts people for for life so getting that proper treatment I imagine can really help reset people's course in life and\nRight and one of the important things to recognize and why it's so important for us to hand the patient off\nSome other training facility once they are detoxify is this is a lifelong condition it doesn't go away\nYou know yes they may not be drinking anymore they may not be using drugs anymore but this condition continues to persist and all that has to be addressed ... was the Persians learning how to cope with things in South different than have always turn bills with a bottle or whatever they've used up until that point\nAnd it does affect the whole family so part of our treatment program is that we include the family in the process and because the the addictive person isn't the only person that impacted by the illness and so we we want to make sure that everybody that's impacted is part of the process\nWell and and I imagine in from things that I've heard oftentimes ah addiction can be with within families because it can be learned behavior I suppose\nThat was more than just learn um use alcohol is an example one of the things that determines whether someone will have a problem with drinking later in life is that came into this world with an excess of the enzyme that breaks out all down it's called ...\nAnd that's the genetic piece that's the piece that runs in families as I mean the person's going to become an alcoholic but from early age exposed to alcohol to metabolize it faster than the next\nAs they could drink everybody else when I was actually I have no hanging over so they couldn't see what the big deal was everyone complaining about you know feel terrible the next day because it didn't happen to their right but with continued exposure to alcohol liberties producing more and more as a sense of\n... so the only way to overwhelm the enzymes that's the most up the volume of alcohol\nAnd hands you have the cat chasing its own tail until you finally reached the breaking point the important thing for the hearts and protect or to recognize his and the day they quit drinking to the day that die\nThe alcohol level of alcohol the hydrogenated stays exactly where it was which is why you hear stories of people who were over for an extended period of time five ten Fifteen Years I go out drinking it within two weeks to write back to where they left off\nBecause the systems already set up right oh so there's a lot of education that goes along with a but wants one takes the position that they're going to do something about the problem it's also important to recognize that this was life all\nWell and and again everything that we're saying it becomes a lot for people to deal with when there are so getting that hill and finding those resources is so important\nRight right and and you write writes very ... it's hard for us to get the word out because people this isn't there's a lot of stigma attached to this illness and a lot of people don't talk about it openly\nUm and so that's why we were very grateful to have the opportunity to come here and talk about it and let people know because you're right one in five people will have an diagnosable mental illness in their lifetime I'm so we know that that addiction is a huge problem and we want to make sure that people aware of this resource to the very fortunate to have it in southeast Texas\nWell I'm excited the jaw came on the show today and we do need to keep getting that information out there and making sure it's available because again ah I Know within my family I've certainly seen some you know people go through some difficulties I had rotator cuff surgery last year\nAnd I'd never experienced paying like that and with I took out or go down and I never understood how people could get addicted to anything before that I understood what\nHad the you know because it made it made me feel better right and not feeling better with what I was wanting to do but I had a\nWeaned myself from that and and luckily I was at a point where I was able to do it but I I did realize that how addiction just happens it's not intentional people don't start down to track where they you know do you know one\nWakes up one day says I'm going to be a lifelong ... addict thrown out the way in thing happens you know that's never anybody's life goal is something that develops gradually over time well\nI I think ah awareness is so important but then providing the tools for people to be able to make that recovery and this is a great opportunity for veterans and their families to access those resources that might not be available to them in\nOrdinary times but so right now this this is going on at this point\nYes exactly this program started July first we are anxious to get referrals and to end to fill those bad because we want to demonstrate that there is definitely a need in our community\nAnd how people get in touch if they if they have an issue or know a family member\nHas lately what they need to do is call a Baptist behavioral health and I'm going to get the number is for all nine three six three\nFor one eight zero and the only thing that we're going to ask is that the person bring some kind of documentation for most veterans that's a D D to fourteen which is there a service history record that they get when they're discharged from the the service\nUm as as proof and and we will take that and will do whatever they ... whatever they ... they need to get them into our program\nWell thank you both so much for being on the show today and
