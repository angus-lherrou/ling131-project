planes are always seem to trucks up or do you get into them\nA yes we are our count so that we did Monday were a way down from what we've had in the last several weeks so I think we finally turned the corner on it\nThis rain for them and we're getting more rain again on today we're speaking it does is that going to increase the populace anything\nI don't think it's going to make a major difference where it is getting these spotty showers now they don't send it to last very long or I don't think anything's really bonding or pulling up\nUm and now we did have a schedule this morning and we did get went it out that way I'm a little too high\nBut uh I think we'll probably be able to get a peace prize out this out this week some time uh but it's kind of just certain areas as they're called line or we're finding mosquitoes in a few different areas were spraying those areas\nWhat are some of the more the more populated areas you're seeing them in in in the county\nWell as always a pleasure out on the one of the worst but I mean I think we can spray that place every day uh and but ... not as bad as it was for the last several weeks\nUm and then we've had calls from China are now like I said they're kind of spotty all over the county uh but I'm encouraged by ah the news that we're supposed to be getting some drier weather and some north when so that should help out a lot\nAnd speaking of helping out a lot do you explain this before talk about how citizen citizens can help out by trying to keep the population down as well\nRight or that can always uh help us out or help themselves out by a emptying any containers around their houses that are that are holding water\nA and don't just add water but actually the dump 'em out and and then fill it with fresh water because uh it takes about a week for a mosquito to go there to complete psycho from egg to adults a few interrupt that by dumping the water out you've done your all mosquito control\nThat it doesn't get any mosquito control director Kevin sex and up next we get the fire safety update from our Texas state network\nThe basic message from fire departments around the country this week fire can happen

overall more about wellness inactivity her and bringing out the resources that are available to our seniors as well as the caretakers of the seniors we have that's it\nThat's a good thing that this event does because I think that um\nSeniors get kind of a bird's eye view of all of the services that are available to them so many of them I don't think no and they and it's hard for them to to get out but this is what you know it's all in one place\nAbsolutely we have over um over fifty vendors we have um breakout sessions this year for the first time why the all time is association given a presentation\nThan Bruce our social mortuary given a presentation as well as um a county extension agent who will be given a presentation as well about um caring for your elderly parents and preparing

take care of older parents are invited to come as well\nAbsolutely because you know the resources it at the senior celebration that's fine there's activities is dance performances in Dr Jimi Simmons there'll be performing this year I'm very popular items that you know the door as I read some bingo but more importantly there's also the resources are available\nFor you know the seniors and for the caretakers to be able to see and prepare and to get to know and plan ahead as well\nExactly very important and and do they do any health um oh I Know the value of it will\nBe will be out of there

city of all my lakeside center which is going to be the new location for best years yes they will be out there they're volunteers will do lead us in some aerobics at first thing off in the

vet will pop up as well\nPerfect great event thanks for sharing that with us and um I Know it will be will attended thank you and fun OK Gigi ... is in Studio with us and we're going to talk about a very important day it's um probably at the rotary is is hosting this because ... Rudy rotary I'm going to say it [laughter]\nUm it's really responsible for the eradication of polio and so this is an awareness day on the twenty fourth of October give us a script\nThat's correct so world polio awareness day is October twenty fourth and that's something that takes place\nEvery year just to help build awareness um on how close we are to eradicating this disease I'm as you mentioned ... are are pretty much responsible for and how close we are to the eradication uh with the help of obviously other law or under nation right partner's bill and Melinda Gates\nAre huge advocates of this um of of this this push and um\nSo what we're doing because I'm with the Rotary Club ... and I was asked to coach aired this event uh with Mr check Mason so I'm I've enjoyed it's been an honor getting to work with him and uh we came up with\nThe idea to show a documentary called dare to dream and and it's called dared to dream how rotary became the heart and soul of polio eradication it's about fifty six minute documentary\nVery very um [noise] it very informational a lot of people aren't aware of um you know first of all how\nEasily this disease can be transmitted um last case I think I have no clue okay well yeah it's interesting you know ... it's a stubborn disease and and it's very highly highly contagious while last case in the United states was in Nineteen Seventy nine um\nHowever another case popped up in Nineteen eighty four because someone traveled to the U.S with it yeah um there's only three countries left that actually have a have seen polio and then in order for a country to be polio free considered polio free they have to have not had a case in three years\nUm we're getting very close all law though for the you know the reason it's so important to keep on this at all it takes is for one traveler right carries it to to to come to whatever country and then it spreads again and I'm as many people know it's obviously a very debilitating\nDisease I had no idea it was ... pages yeah absolutely and then it's so that the vaccine is oral\nUm inch just super simple um it's just a matter of getting the funds to to get those that those vaccines to these countries and and be done with it so\nOur event is at the Lamar at John Gray auditorium and it's October twenty four so we're not hors d'oeuvres and cocktails and beer and wine and a a social kind of networking prior prior to around six thirty at night and I said if being we're going to show the documentary\nTickets are twenty five dollars per person and obviously all those funds go towards the\nUm the eradication of polio or we hope to fill the auditorium such a worthwhile of that it it is and the documentary is so inspiring well educational um\nEducational information that we all need to know and uh and of course a great call ... lately and for tickets that you can go to the Rotary Club of Beaumont Facebook page and there will be a link there it's a kind of a complicated links\nI'm not going to hurry about verbalize but if you go to Rotary Club of bone want at a\nFacebook page the Lincoln on there and you can click there and you can if you can't make the actual event you can simply just make a donation hurt 'em and everything is matched also mentioned Bill Melinda gates they match it also the governor of our Rotary Club is making a match to

attorney general Rod Rosenstein I ask this because for a long time now in appeared as if Rosenstein was in on the block\nAfter all it was Rosen side to authorize the Mohler Russian collusion illusion investigation\nAnd who signed off on at least one of those Pfizer warrants to spy on Mr Trump but now despite a New York times space exposing Rosenstein as an anti Trump co conspirator suddenly he's the president's new best friend forever\nMaybe Rosenstein is a double agent between the White House in the deep state or maybe as the old proverb says keep your friends close but your enemies closer\nIs that why President Trump hasn't fired Rosenstein might not be do now where it is Mueller's team is slowly finishing up with many of his henchmen currently resigning they're closing down

... a missteps and why he should uh be disciplined or even fired and that was after that memo that Comey was fired so McCabe in a subsequent conversation with Rosenstein Rosenstein was\nPushing back saying what do you want me to wear a wire where the president and that's the another take on that on on that conversation but look I think we have a bigger problem here it's not just\nThe Obama era

Ford\nWho portrayed herself as an innocent victim is now suspected of allegedly working along with her Democrat attorneys and maybe\nWas in on a plan and naturally designed to force justice Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nHer anonymous letter was supposed to be enough for him to do that but when someone leaked it or was that part of the planned to delete it too I don't know cabin are refused to withdraw and the plot against him second\nBut he held strong and the FBI is final background check demanded by the Democrats actually backfired on them\nNow has opened the possibility of a new major investigation that could very well end up with serious charges against all the players even Dr Christine Blasey Ford herself\nHer secret not really a secret blunder was purposely inhaled they say and then leap to the news media by people on Dianne Feinstein staff or maybe even Senate minority leader Charles Schumer\n... forge clay nonetheless her claims were immediately investigated by the Senate Judiciary committee\nShe was provided the hearing and treated with up most courtesy by the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee and matter of fact they didn't even doctor they add that lawyer doctor\nNow as a delaying tactic that Democrats then demanded another FBI report\nAssuming it would take much longer than the dead now this should serve as a reminder that the Democrats as all of us to be very careful what we wish for because what we really really what we usually get\nThe final FBI report was conducted and instead of driving the matter out quickly confirmed by the allegations against justice Kavanaugh were uncorroborated\nAnd beyond that but the person Mrs Ford claimed was with her the house during the alleged rape attempt a woman's name was ... the Kaiser\nBesides saying she wasn't there also told the FBI that Democrat operatives attempted to have\nHer change your story\nAnd commit perjury what let me say that again Leland\nKaiser besides saying she wasn't there are also told investigators told the FBI that Democrat operatives attempted to have her change your story and commit perjury in other words why just make it up\nAnd this of course is should be further proof that all of what happened was a fraud from the start and is further revealed all front it is with misinformation when Mrs Ford's activists democratic lawyer Deborah attach\nTo listen to what I'm going to tell you not Deborah cat she was a lawyer for Mrs Ford she referred to Dr forge friend\nA person Dr Ford this ... guys are the doctor for Jeb Bush president ... ...\nThen who denied it and was coached into trying to change her her her ... or ...\nLie about it and say she has there been she said she wasn't well anyhow legal in ... whenever they put the affidavit together\nIt has been our

I Would expect right now based on all forecast this interest rates are going to continue to rise as they have and based on the housing market here in southeast Texas\nWe've seen appreciation ... pretty significant appreciation for Jefferson County and in southeast Texas this past year and I would expect more\nYeah I Would agree I Would agree and and you know we'll see what happens what what demand does at but as jobs continue to come in\nAs the economy continues to do well\nThen ... and ... look let's face it a lot of these projects that we're looking at right now is driving the economy and driving not demand were put on the table in two thousand eight two thousand nine so literally that feasibility as taking ten years to get to the table right now they're not just gonna\nShut them down right and say no we're not going to do that no matter what they don't pay a lot of attention to what the economy does so I I agree with you I mean as as we continue to demand real estate as the prices continue to appreciate\nA as our inventories continue to stay low there is there is not really a smart way to time the market at this point in time if you if you're looking for home get yourself oh\nWell and re max one we see signs all over south east Texas\nWith re max one fan so when people are looking to either buy homes are selling homes\nAre they really need to work with a full time professional realtor and re max I Know you all have a lot of a lot of that there are at your office throughout south east Texas so tell people why it's important to work with a realtor whether you're looking to buy or sell the advantages of that\nWell the experience counts and and you know everyone out here that the deals with anything says you know people have come before me I\nI can learn from other people's mistakes were we have a wealth of people that anyone that's either knew or or has always been in the market you learn something new every day and\nWe have groups that get together within our own company talking about what are the biggest issues you're facing what's your biggest challenge and how can we help to resolve that challenge that experience that comes to the table\nAnd the great one share so when it gets shared with everyone gains that common knowledge it raises us all up so so everyone looks better\nIn that and goes into every situation with that experience of someone that's been there for fifty years\nI'm which were able to take advantage of it as a matter of fact we just I don't know if you notice we just made a we just acquired an office in Mount Bellevue\nSo we now will be from east Houston all the way to the Louisiana border and all the way up to Sam Rayburn down to the Gulf Coast\nSo uh you know if you're not growing you're dying and if I don't set the example of how to take a chance and continue to move out there than what I expect that from the people that I work with\nRon do you do a great job and you've got some great agents over there that are that are tearing up the market and it is I Know as a lender it's so important because communication people understanding that process the process moves at a much faster speed\nAnd which for some people especially when they're entering the market there are a little bit surprised at how quickly if you're looking to buy or sell things can happen a because oftentimes we're used to having some time to think about it and now when you have\nYou may not have the same options as you did a day or two days or three days before which is the same way that even so it implies whether you're looking to sell your house or you're looking to buy a new house you need to have a plan you need to have to be working with a professional beforehand singer and you can have\nRealistic expectations about what's to follow because as soon as you pulled that trigger things start happening right away\nIs the real surprises that home right and it's in the rye condition it can move within twenty four hours that should be the goal of the of view and the realtor if the realtors looking for what's most important to you\nThen you should be able to have something going on there if everybody listens to everybody that if if you're selling your house and you don't have somewhere to go or you're not even looking that you could be in a very interesting situation\nThat's a nice way to say that it right and you know it's it's interesting because\nWith how quickly things move people\nAre ... you know like you say you're talking about sellers you're also talking about bars they go out and look at a house and then they there there may be five or six offers on that house within twenty four to forty eight hours and understanding you know whether you're the seller or the buyer\nHaving that market knowledge makes it's a big help\nWe're looking I remember it wasn't for five years ago and that we had a meeting in the office with everybody and they're saying okay\nLet's make sure we all knew how to handle multiple offers situations and now people are disappointed if they don't get multiple offers and that may turn again to where it's not that way anymore but it's just fascinating to me\nHow far we've come so fast\nEveryone's adapted and now this is like what we're used to\nWrite write well particularly for those of us in the industry yeah but those are people that are entering the house buying market van their drive from your borrowed if\nIf you've only done this once or twice then it may have been ten years ago which was a completely different environment than what we're in right now\nI Know the jaw your ah your agents over there do a great job of communicating and one reason we love working with them is for that because for whether it's a bar or a cellar\nIf they the more information they have the better by our cell or they are and and the more they understand that process and so it becomes really valuable and I've seen you know as a lender will see people doing for sale\nA banner transactions him and we have a script that we go over 'cause we let people know of the challenges that are there because we see them all but\nI'm buyers and sellers get cross why they can't communicate they're wanting us to talk we can't do that for him or you know people ah people don't understand\nThat side of the market so it's really important to work with a professional that has that experience that can hold their hand through that make sure they're getting the best value if they're selling and also getting the best value of their mind but understanding the market area and in what they're paying we encourage\nThem to sell it themselves and we give them a three hundred and fifty six point plan of all of the things that they need to do in order to get\nThat done
