... in the journal is always a this time of year to get real excited coming up on Wednesday it is trick or treat in ... what should\nCitizens or be on the outlook for the you know make sure everything's going to be OK\nWell first of all we need you to be the one paying attention and watching out for kids I realize it's their parents' job but kids get excited they break away they're looking for candy we're going to have all kinds of festivals carnivals trick or treat that churches things like that\nSo that whole week is going to be an exciting week for children so just no we asked the kids the parents to make sure the kids are in well lit um costumes things like that that you can see at night\nMaybe some real reflective material on the coast\nAbsolutely if there is some kind of reflective tape or something you can put on the costumes make sure they're in shoes that they're not tripping and falling in and talk to them before they go out and explain to them not to eat the candy right away and have a parent and adult somebody checked the candy out\nTalk to them about not going into the homes of people given out candy explained to them that you know it's a funny vent everybody's excited about Halloween but there are dangers that lurk out there\nYou know a lot of times as you got a touched on it or they're all bad people out there and all of us who don't want to go to the homes and I guess is highly recommended that you know even those kids were say hey I'm big arguments on my own is really to have a parent or or grown up around them while they're going house to house\nKids need supervision I don't care if they're toddlers up to junior high even some of your high school kids you need to\nKnow where they're going what they're doing because we find a lotta mischievous things that happened during that time we have kids you know trashing decorations and doing things\nAnd talk to your kids about the fact that officers going to be looking for that there are still curfews and those kids need to be careful to they need to make sure they're wearing reflective things they get just as excited they run around in packs in groups and\nGo to homes is\nIf the lights are out and no one's answering their door don't continue to ring door bells and look for areas where the lights her own welcoming people trick or treating\nYou know there's going to lead them an explanation for those handing out candy you know make sure you're well it and what are your house\nAbsolutely make sure you're well lit make sure I'm you know you might want to step outside your door don't encourage people to come inside makes sure once you run out of candy you turn your lights out and that is basically universal signed for hey I'm Out of candy we're not giving out treats here\nAnd kids are doing church where they may go so in groups have a good way to get a bill got on your we\nEncourage them to go to gather if they have\nSomebody that can you know kind of show for him around and and supervise them basically kids need supervision and that's not just for you know getting run over in the street but just for basic decision making they need someone there to make sure that they're making the choices while they're\nThat there's so much that comes with Donald Trump that's right out in front and he doesn't hide things he doesn't speak\nIn a kind of a double talk or synthetic language that a lot of experienced incapable politicians use most things about Donald Trump or very visible and in the prologue I checked myself to task for not understanding what I could have learned\nIn just looking at the words and the sentence you just read I won't give it away 'cause it's an entertaining prologue but I Do take myself to task for\nNot saying hey maybe there's something right here in front of me and if I just spent some time to look and listen and learn\nTo get ahead of the game it took me many many months of being around Donald Trump to figure out what I look back in retrospect might have been more obvious to me and it's been a little bit more time\nAnd the other point of the book was Trump's wild ride your vote a thank you rally he held in Wisconsin just outside of Milwaukee after he had won the election and uh you note that Paul Ryan was house speaker not appeared and once\nWith Donald Trump during the campaign that is to say the ... running mate had not campaigned with\nThe party's twenty sixteen nominee Ryan shows up there more than seven thousand drew blood Trump supporters including a thousand who stood in sub freezing temperatures for more than six hours and Ryan says\nIn that crowd or set of does not recognize maybe ten people I've been doing Republican it's practically all my life I didn't know any of them before not Republicans were Trump voters\nAre at the time I said the Republican Party was undergoing a hostile takeover I guess or in a way it was\nIt was and it sort of depends on your definition of hostility a strip likes to say the rallies are full of spirit and energy and the great fire that he loves and the Trump supporters have this kind of almost ... billion call and response was Trump whether it's the ... or in a much\nMore aggressive says lock her up really talking about Hillary Clinton but they have this sort of play act relationships is that all hostile\nWell jumped as of things so Trump supporters do lots of Republicans look askance at and say we're directional uses all leading us well it led Donald Trump to be the forty describes the United states and those Trump supporters to identify with the Republican Party at least branded as they see Trump branding it as their new political home the duration of all that\nI don't know I Do not have a unified theory ... world is going\nTo just try to describe what I've seen what's happened so far and what it might\nMean it's interesting you note off a lot of people who were fed up with the conservative politicians who talked conservative but didn't always vote conservative really led to a great extent to the Trump phenomenon and yet that inconsistency which is quite understandable that it did cause consternation among Republican ranks\nUh Donald Trump has shown a great diverse agility of a a convictions over the years of that doesn't seem to bother his supporters as much\nDoesn't bother supporters uh he is probably the least adventure local\nA Republican who has been in politics for the last twenty or Thirty years to have as for his support among evangelical Christians and worker Republicans and conservatives I also point out in the book and one of the most disciplined and focus components of the Trump Administration the federal bench starting with the Supreme Court of appeals court justices and district court judges\nIt is ironic historically ironic that probably the least ideologically grounded conservative in modern Republican Party history is going to be the most successful\nAt re populating the federal bench with hard line conservatives that itself is a kind of jaw dropping bit of historical iron\nMajor Garrett CBS News the White House correspondent his new book Mr Trump's wild ride\nThat

forty young professionals that have been recognized through this program and and well deserving and this year I understand a hundred and said then nominees say I mean forty had to be chosen from this that's that's another thing\nThat kind of goes to show you that even with what two hundred and forty that have already received this honor there there are still that many young professionals out there

got to get nominated and recommendations from others cracked\nSalute we absolutely in ah like you said it was quite the process we were both sitting in on it so I Know I'm In it I'm\nSix years in a row that's just really awesome this event is hosted by southeast Texas young professionals organization which is a division of the greater Belmont chamber of commerce and we partner with southeast Texas dot com and the Beaumont enterprise to make this all come together\nOr we do want to mention our title sponsors mobile oil credit union as well as sponsors Gene Gene enterprises J.K Chevrolet

industries that are going to be represented this year a these are young professionals who are leading organizations their owners of organizations there I mean there's this is a great group and we're excited\nTo own wide range of very wide range as as professionals that is so so let me get this straight we've we've we've identified who the forty are at this point and I'm now we're going to have an event to celebrate these folks\nYeah kind of a chance to bring them to this big reveal party have their family and friends come out of the community come out and support them and just showcase an award and thanked them for what they do to make this community thrived\nPerfect I Love it when it the event\nIs going to be Thursday November eighth at five thirty or Jefferson theater\nPerfect and anybody can can open to the public evidence public free fabulous I Tyler who who are we going to be honoring this year as far as our representatives in the community\nSo we have so many from the public sector and the private sector these are entrepreneur Z or people in education are positions lawyers healthcare engineers realtors mortgage lending and marketing\nAnd you know John and I were involved in tons of organizations and every once in a while you look at your busy schedule you have to really odd it\nYou know which ones are going to dedicate myself to act like which one bringing the most value to me and I know personally and uh for John his will sell these sections of professionals is one that I Would never want to leave because\nIt is for young professionals that are aged Twenty one to forty\nAnd you know as young professionals sometimes you go to a lot of these chamber of events and there's\nPeople that are decades older than you and they're they're not really run an inner circle and so you may feel a little bit left out and so this group kind of puts everybody on the same page you know you may be in there with people that you went to high school with a with a little more with\nAnd you kinda have more common ground and similar interests and or the chamber of always kind of jokes like who wears the where's the over\nForty and I said well that that's all that's like yeah we usually that's the chamber of resembled that remark yeah my theory that\nAll of a wide view or eventually one day going to become decision makers and we'll have like a graduation for the forty one and that I mean it's kind of what we call party crushers so there's really a party crash maybe forty one forty two so definitely if there's a\nThere's an after hours networking a vintage a wills is you're going to see some some ... ...\nWe want you that's awesome day on that same note that once you turn forty it's not like okay well you're just done your debt us there are divisions of the chamber that you can become a part of their leadership development communication division you can still be involved so we just\nWant to let that but yeah we have some advisors as well but we did that old\nBut speaking of individuals over forty one of my favorite events that we host is called breakfast with the boss yes we pick a a leader in the community that you know but they may be a CEO or president of a company that really has an interesting background story of how they came from the beginning to where they are now and provide lots of takeaways and this is a\nA more personal setting where you can have some one on one questions you can really get some some face time with these leaders you know you can't just walk into a large organization and say hey what's the c._e._o. up to to\nDo it right out of the yeah where do you come from how are you you can do that right in the ... with a combination really valuable and inspirational I Would think it is yes definitely and and we we combine that\nWith a monthly lunches uh after hours for it so we try to spread around south east Texas from from mid county to Jefferson County to harden county make sure we include everyone in southeast Texas\nWell with Vince events that are at different times of the day so that everybody can maybe work it into their schedule from a lunch to an evening to okay so how do we plug into why pie as someone out there listening is much younger than than me and in in in your grave and how do they how do they get involved\nOr we have a website se T. X. Y. P. O. dot org but beyond that were highly active on social media probably the Facebook page is the most active just type in southeast Texas\nProfessionals organization and you can keep up with events on there the membership is fifty dollars for the year you can do that on line and I'm white collar so there's just a lot of value in this the breakfast with the boss I'm\nThat when we do alternating every other month\nAnd like you said actually the last one we did was with one of ... co workers at Baptist who's the CEO Baptist hospital that gives you that chance to hear their best practices what worked what didn't work and how they got to where they are so it's very valuable and we we put a lot of thought and to who we ...\nI think there's a lot of value in a fifty dollar membership\nAnd everybody that gets awarded for dinner forty gets a free membership for the next year\nPerfect so he got forty new members right there you go really it's a good group I think it's um I think it's important that the community really um\nRally around these folks and let them know like you said how appreciative we are for their leadership because they're acknowledge not only for their leadership

have been designed as an October surprise and funded by democratic operatives like George Soros and some anti American foreign dictators as well\nAs much of this also is being done and delusion with the corrupt liberal news media hoping to create televised images of little children crying and being separated from their parents right on time for the midterm us elections\nAnd such televised damages the Democrats we'll we'll push suburban Republicans to vote Democrat\nThe plan is simple usually caravan of the illegal migrants to tug at the heart strings of American viewers more especially those so called suburban white women the ones Democrats feel well then cause them to vote for the Democrats because\nPresident Trump is separating families\nOkay so let's get this straight the political party specifically the Democrat Party\nWhich long ago was abandoned the notion of supporting the traditional middle class American family composed of mom and dad living with their children\nNow believes television images of crying children will move American moms to vote for the anti for additional family pro abortion Democrats\nWhat it really demonstrates is what little respect the Democrats have for Kurdish no American families\nThe new president of Mexico that's far has failed to successfully turned the caravan around and since the caravan doesn't seem to be winning the hearts

another ... feet\nOf their radical agenda what will they do what will they do\nI think they'll try anything we do know that they'll continue the nonsense they've been doing if they win right because it means that works in fact they'll wrap it up even more\nAnd asking what they're gonna do you know questions like that or realistic because it probably goes without saying their anger will very likely escalate if they lose a mid germs and the Republicans retain control of both the house and Senate\nSo you know unless they just accept the situation which is very unlikely and then forced them maybe ... well what they'll do if they lose and they don't ... will turn their hopes back toward the Mueller probe but one of the Mahler which on sales to materialize and it falls apart too\nI have no

hat today while you're in the city has a ... year realtor hat and then then uh the real estate Institute at AT T that you're in charge or\nSo but let's start with just real estate 'cause I Know you help people buy and sell houses just search and how you do it now is a little bit different than you did three four years ago because the market continues to get\nBetter and it's it really is amazing to look at the market to what it's doing um you know I'm I'm a I'm a nerd I enjoy looking at statistics and things like that and just seeing where the market's going and how it's performing compared to\nUh to what it did several you know just even a year and a half two years ago um you'd traditionally historically we're getting into that you know that last push of\nA you know let's let's get things so let's get things done a because whenever we get to Thanksgiving things are going to slow down tremendously we're going to get into Christmas people every Christmas parties things are just they just slow down at the end of the year I don't think that this will we're going to be a this year I mean we're we're at a place where\nUm you know people people need to to buy a home our inventory as low as it's been for a while and\nUh you know if you're wanting to sell now's the time to do it and even getting into the holiday season I think we're still going to see you know a very busy market well\nI Know last December was an extraordinarily busy time in the hills of Harvey but you know and as catastrophic as Harvey was and as many homes as it affected\nYou know the the one that's a big factor but the other huge factory we have so many first time homebuyers coming into the market because there's so many new jobs and people\nThat started out have careers here making money and they want to invest in the community so you've got all the first time homebuyers as well but if you were talking about there's a real lack of inventory right\nRight so I mean if you're if you thought about selling your home or\nIf that's all just ever crossed your mind or ever pondered I Wonder what I could get from my home and give me a call I'd be more than happy to tell you 'cause you're like ... with him and toward being home is just to you know simple economics thing that you learn and you're an economics class supply and demand supplies low demand has increased which is going to help you get the top dollar for your home\nWell and so the market is appreciating here in southeast Texas we're seeing that also as a lender interest rates are going up so you know I've been saying for the last several years now's the time to buy now certainly is even those\nMarkets appreciation ah appreciating and the inventories are tight six months from now those houses are going to be priced higher than they are right now in interest rates in all likelihood will be higher so you're going to be getting a better deal now than you are six nine months\nAbsolutely and you know people you know I hear people say you know um oh man interest rates are going up that's you know it's still we're still historically low ... I mean I was talking to somebody that they are buying a home you know a a vacation home when they were saying that they got\nA they were a little bit bone because they got a four and a half percent interest rate and I was like okay well let's\nThink back to the house that you live in now that you bought back in Nineteen eighty seven what was your interest rates will nine percent so we're still looking at historically low interest rates in because rates are going just proves again that the economy is doing well\nSo we can justify you know those numbers increasing so well how do people get in touch with your what's your phone you can call or text me at four O. nine three one three zero nine three four\nAnd that's just the absolute best way to get in touch with me if I don't answer I'll get back with his ...\nAnd then if people are interested in a career in real estate you can help them with that\nYou know and that's one of the things I Love I Love teaching that's a passion of mine uh uh it translates into a buyers and sellers that I work with I'm going to teach you along the way but I Love teaching people to you know if you want to have a career in real estate is great time to do so\nTo see a lot of people are getting on board with that our classes have increased a tremendously we've uh this is the biggest a set of students that have had since uh five years or ... or so I can give me a call or text of the same number I'll help you figure out how you can have a career in real estate too\nWell and in technology's changed the industry's changed you know and this is a great way to get acquainted with people that you would actually be working with two in the future and there's you bring in a lot of uh speakers as well\nYeah we we try to make it a as a interactive as possible make sure that you're not just you know collaborating with your future colleagues you know that of your classmates now but you know talking to industry professor light Roy list\nUh getting people are you getting out there in the the real world and in doing projects that are going to benefit you later in the career 'cause there's different education programs that will just you know here's a book\nRead it take a test you know go get your state license\nA A R refused allow my program to do that I Want you to learn as much as you can ah because you're eventually me working with me you may be on the other end of a deal with me and if you don't know what you're doing you're going to make my job harder so I Want to turn out the best quality agents that I possibly can because\nI really believe in the industry and I believe in what we'd do and I wanted to be the best that they can be well\nAnd so many of the ah agents in southeast Texas have benefited from L. I. T. and the program we all have out there\nBut uh you know information or education is just so important and and it's always been important in today's world perhaps that it continues the important certainly hadn't been minimized because information changes all the time so you need to stay better informed because\nThe information to five years ago is not a gun necessarily it's not going to necessarily apply\nAnd certainly when it comes to real estate we've seen that because uh you know people and so often when you're talking to family members and you're talking to friends\nThey're real estate experience is from their last real estate transactions right whether it was three years ago five years ago ten years ago and\nThe one thing I always tell people that it's changed and they said well how that changed us it will tell me from which period you're talking about and I'll tell you but the changes constant and change it noise bad but it it's important to be aware of because when you go to sell a house now you also need to know where you're going to go\nAbsolutely I mean uh you you absolutely right the the the one constant thing with real estate has changed\nA the contracts were getting updated continually ah changes in looming regulations are always something that we have to look at 'em and if and like you said if you sold the house you know even two years ago a pre Harvey Harvey impacted and changed the landscape real estate in southeast Texas\nA tremendously so even if you just walk us old house two years ago well\nYeah but that was one house we've been doing this constantly over and over and over again and we see it every single day or so you did it once we do it time and again so we we are the experts are rebuilding guide you through the process\nWell and it's so important to work with a real estate professional and when you're buying or selling a house and as as a lender out tell people we have a specific script of information we go over with when people say they're doing a for sale by owner because there can be so many different challenges that come up\nAnd as a lender we can't negotiate those were not a part of the transaction were just loaning money run on that transaction so it's just so important so be sure to gifts David I call we're going to be sharing his contact information as we come up were up on a break we'll be back right

typical for\nWhat you experienced in restaurants anymore\nThat is true or at ... and I think you're probably referencing the style of survival just family style and and you go to a typical restaurant and you expect your food come out played it for you well we make you participate a little bit and one of the the miracles that we get to see because it's participation dining rather than just us\nTaking care of your completely as it makes you put your phone down you're not able to sit there and and check your text messages and ... it kind of forces a conversation to a card table much like the dinner table at home\nSo we we get to see a kind of a different kind of a miracle every day at dinner or lunch or whenever you come in\nWhen people are sitting there in the end you're forced to pass table because past the plate of mashed potatoes because what eventually happens if you're like Stephen ... is right now on his phone and and he's got the mashed potatoes Maynard somebody's gonna throw biscuit ... pass those potatoes\nSo it's a great little miracle that we get to see every day well and\nYou know it that is something to that has\nThat is not is typical as it once was when I was growing up you know because there are so many distractions in the world today and you were critical of how things change but one reason they changes the world's changed around us\nAnd some of those changes aren't always for the best I mean you know it's like with technology we all love our phones we in ...\nIn the technology and all that you're able to do on them but it means it's hard to escape\nAnd people expect quicker responses\nBut you know just for a better quality of life and certainly if you're going to stay connected to your family and loved ones are if you're going to go to dinner and enjoy somebody's company and get acquainted with them you you know it's it's nice to be able to disconnect and like you say sadly that's an experience that it's not as frequent as it used to be at at people some\nVery very true and and there were there was a great deal of ah questioning on social media and other places are gone and I can't believe you're leaving that old house and it was a needle mansion ah\nBut at the same time you know I grew up on a ranch in northeast Texas where\nAre we had a house and we had a barn and my prayers referred me to stay in the barn so I feel pretty at home out there in this ah we've created a barn that feels like shoot Lindbergh or Bernie Texas hill country and and and it's a really a cool venue one of the the greatest changes I mean one where we haven't changed anything as far as the food goes\nMatter of fact we're going to be expanding the menu and just a couple of weeks a matter of fact by the time that this errors were going to have an expanded menu so we've heard our customers were going to we're not going to be strictly fried course we're not that now we have smoke chicken but\nWe're going to be adding red fish grilled we're going to be doing grilled shrimp grilled chicken breast grilled catfish\nI'm as well as some new items um at first I wasn't really excited about a salad I mean I'm the guy that passes you know I don't eat anything green just keep it out [noise] um I don't even need our own green beans 'cause I Want mashed potatoes and meat but\nWe've added a salad chef Andres has done this amazing job with some just a straightforward you'd think the most simple thing that he has created a chicken breast ... a salad that's unbelievable the crew tons of money that her biscuits\nAnd and so the the calorie
