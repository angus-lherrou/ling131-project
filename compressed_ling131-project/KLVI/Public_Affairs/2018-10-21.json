{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "I live in if you're not getting all three hours became commando show joined Kim's club that's right head over to get\nKim Dotcom and for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the podcast chat\nWith all the great folks in the chat room because they're fabulous by the way and then we have contests you can come see the show and the list goes on and on they want to head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom it all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona some low there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well I have a question\nUh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah of a a website that I have one son mind right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a check of function I'm not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you you know is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as employment of people to support that are the questions or what have you\nAlways oh yeah oh really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we ... deployed shop dot ... dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have some of the place so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have ah\nEmploy individuals to support the ah the ... function somehow that would work as they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask them to know so the third question so I Would give them the interest as well so as I as a person would\nAll in that it would get a hold of this company and they would have to ask the question of is she they had the the canned answer that I've already given but of course I Do ... and ... of those dirty question\nYeah ... and say here's the reason why I'm hesitating that is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our business is that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my real hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website she kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um\nAre you building the site or if somebody building and for you\nA yes or the the we do have a website it's already been built and we have another company and building a another website I'll always have that but when we have a third tempting is calling me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters seem kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also lift some of those questions under FAA cues as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bought and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without

foundation to help rebuild the women's in children's shelter earlier this week I had a chance to visit with a ... with family services of southeast Texas\nWe're joined by Deborah ... of the interim executive director with the family services the southeast Texas a dump is a really exciting news this week or two hundred and fourteen thousand dollar grab from the asteroid foundation tell us about this grabbed in what's this mean for family services\nUm we receive that two hundred and fourteen thousand dollar grant from the Astros foundation it's going to have that rebuild our shelter um I Know that everybody knows a year ago\nHarvey we got um hit really really bad and um we had to do a total rebuild on the shelter\nSo it was about the shelter was to provide to sell the searches\nThe shelter we have a sixty five that unit at the shelter it is a shelter for domestic violence victims and their children\nAnd um what we do is we provide everything for them from um counseling um food closing\nAnd everything else that they need to be able to recover from that traumatic experience\nHow are you able to secure this group\n[noise] um well we are part of the Texas council of family violence and we are part of the region seven and\nJust so happened that the Astros is in region seven and they are really working hard to help us and become our voice for our victim\nSpeaking of your into the law to over loses the mostly well as awareness month for a lot of germs you hear it doesn't happen here to help ... were you handle quite a few cases here in ... you know\nYes we do um as a matter of fact last year we serve eight hundred and fifty five\nI'm victims half of those our children and um approximately um according to Jefferson County um they had four thousand five hundred um reported incidents have family violence um last year and we only saw eight hundred and fifty five\nSo sometimes people will know will to store the rebuilding and when all those new facility reopen ready for those who need\nWe are hoping that the facility will reopen by January or February however we are still open um we are currently in a temporary location the only difference is that the capacity we used to have a sixty five that DNA now is just down to thirty five to forty bad\nUm however even with that um we are on track to actually serve about nine hundred clients this year\nNo these are the only the cases we know about the I'm sure there's several days of the other the the go unnoticed and for those victims talk about the importance of coming forward\n[noise] I think a lot of a lot of our victims victims are scared and are fearful of their lives or they're scared that you know nobody's going to support them um a lot of 'em are abusers\nDo financial abuse emotional abuse physical abuse Everytime they think about domestic violence they always look at that physical abuse like you know women have to have bruises broken legs broken um arms um but domestic violence doesn't stop there\nSo when it comes to financial these a lot of our victims are oppressed so they are in the house they don't they're not allowed to buy they're not allowed to have 'em\nMoney they're not allowed to go anywhere else even you know as long as their abusers now they're they're not allowed to go anywhere so I think the the the thought of being by themselves and you know not able to support their children is one of the biggest fear that are victims um look at\nAnd um we help them with that um when they come to the shelter\nOr even when they come to seek help from us we provide everything that they can never need from\nPampers formula underwear I'm undergarments closing food\nUm we have a MSW that does therapeutic groups therapeutic um individual counseling we have a non license counselor that's there all the time we have a hotline that's twenty four seven\nWe have a staff twenty four seven at all times we have a security guard for ... for their safety at night\nUm are temporary location right now is gated and um we have security gates so there are safety is definitely what's important but also their wellbeing and for them to become independent again and kind of find themselves\nAnd you know knowing that they're going to be okay with their children\nDo we really were dirt roads I'm over ... ... what are some signs someone may notice about a victim whether it's a school teacher looking at a student well there's a person at work looking at a coworker\nThat's a really good question a lot of our victims usually are oppressed a lot of their victims are um go if they see somebody that their boyfriend or their husband or their intimate partner is always with them wherever they go that's that's one of the red flags\nAnd also um every ... every time they if you've noticed that your girlfriend says hey hold on for a second I have to take this call and you see that they're taking a picture of where they're at because some of the abusers will ask\nHey are you sure that you're you're there take a picture of where you're standing so that I Know that you're actually there\nSo that's just that control if if a person is always scared if that person is always\nUm discloses something to you like oh my gosh you know my my my boyfriend or my husband or my partner is you know not wanting me to have money or I have to ask permission all the time that's one of the you know non physical um\nI guess flags red flags and of course when somebody uses\nLong sleeves and you know or they had bruises and they always say oh I just fell and hit my head and the table or you know and you know for a fact that that's not possible\nFor someone was the elbow below ... volunteers or do you look for donations or someone to learn more about them was ... he served as I can do so\nWell they can um give us a call at four zero nine eight three three to six six eight and um look for Bonnie spots she is our community director coordination coordinate coordinator

nonprofit development center as well as the summit many of the events that you're describing today and on your show\nOur hosted by nonprofits and so the nonprofit developments center was founded to help those nonprofits we help them become more effective and more efficient so they can provide these opportunities for our community that's great and you provide\nLike educational program we provide a majority of our programming consist of educational workshops we provide coaching and consultations and then we help make a collaboration since ... teach ... alliances and and I\nThink some of the programs I've seen her like grant writing and promotions and building better boards and you know they\nCover the whole gamut of nonprofit management you know nonprofits are just like businesses and so we need training as well ah so you've mentioned a few budgeting I we have a cyber security workshop that I Will have passed by the time the show airs\nBut it was but it but so as an example at the apple a communication effective communication skills I'm helping a host and playing offense and so really just anything nonprofits need help with ah we try to cater to their deeds\nFabulous and they join your organization and then they can have okay and then they have this um access to all of your resources that's correct including this summit which is the first part of November\nIt is so we're really excited to team up with United Way of ... county you know I'd wave Orange County as well as one star foundation to really bring this opportunity to southeast Texas a what makes the\nSome it's a unique is that it is a we have two summits that are identical Senate so there are two options and and locations from which to choose the two days two days and nuns that will be in Port Arthur at the

well it's just our ... our profits go back into the nonprofit and so that's the business you know the business model of a nonprofit\nUh so uh you know we're all interested in and doing good and helping others and so it is the perfect opportunity to not only network with other like minded individuals but have uh those those learning resources available\nAs well as um you know the opportunity

Trump out of releasing the redacted portions of the information used to obtain those suspect Lawrence due to national security concerns\nFrom what we now understand it or how we understand that\nIt has nothing to do with national security but everything to do with simply having\nOr saving the FBI from in terrorists meant of having to admit it was cooperating with the Clinton campaign to help her defeat President Trump in the twenties sixteen election was there for is the truth\nWell for more than a year the FBI has argued that if the information used to obtain the Pfizer Warren says the ball ...\nIt would do irreparable harm drew American ties with foreign intelligence sources probably Great Britain and Israel\nCould it be that Great Britain and Israel were involved in helping spy on the Trump campaign with the blessings of the FBI and U.S intelligence sources\nBoth the FBI and our intelligence agencies became corrupted during the Obama administration and perhaps they all remain so same people they're right\nNot because of national security but more so as I said to protect their image that's why they don't want to release it they want to protect their image and not suffer the

Trump because\nHe has cautioned that the Saudi Government should be considered innocent until proven guilty so I'm not sure how this is going to turn out the ditch\nUm that that was pretty bad what I'm hearing about what they did to that problem but you know what they don't report it was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd he was a a good friend of the Saudi family before this new regime change and there's been more liberal things happen and I'm sure he's been actively opposing\nThose changes so uh uh he was a it was a journalist for the Washington Post yeah ... well that yeah\nBut

the press is about ... anyway All right I'm topic when we'll see you a next time God Bless you\nThis is Jean God Bless you and God Bless all freedom loving Americans everywhere\n[noise]\nEvery mall or green home\nSooner than are there who believe in of\nThe attendance aspect it's also in order to get the education because in today's world it's certainly challenging uh to uh there's there's a lot of things calling on our time and certainly a lot of things going on our kids and you time today but getting educated beginning classes the first step to get an education\nAnd that the children aren't there we can educate them\nThat is very true and I know that uh you know oftentimes school districts get beat up way too often\nFor for all the challenges in and certainly in a large school districts there's lots of challenges because there's lots of kids but there's\nThe teacher show up every day to educate kids and I know a lot of teachers and I know that their passion is they're passionate love is to teach kids I don't think anybody gets in teaching in stays in teaching if they don't love kids and know how important their education is so\nThat gets lost from time to time that you know the ... and I know y'all veteran admitted ... you know come up through the education ranks scene been in the classroom and realize how important it is from a minutes straight standpoint to to get the information out there a support teachers\nBut you don't want to make sure that hey y'all are doing all you can as an administrator ... teachers but if we don't have the parents grandparents neighbors out there ah encouraging and also you know supporting the district in this a more challenging\nIt does indeed um the message that we really want to get out there to them is that regular school attendance is one of the most powerful ways they can set up their child for success in the future um I don't know of any job at this particular point unless you've created your own and you're working from home\nBut you still have to have the demand a fulfilling orders or or those types of things from your clientele\nBut jobs they expect you to be there on time so we're preparing students for that next level whether it's career college military by teaching them that attendance is very important um\nWhen they make school attendance a priority that helps the students get better grades they develop healthy life habits and it helps him to avoid some of the dangerous behaviors so if they weren't in school there are things that they could end up getting into\nFor instance I'm a student may be involved in some type of accident some type of criminal activity whereas if they were at school and they were engaged and involved it would help them have a better chance of working towards their success in the future and graduating from high school\nCertainly we don't want parents to send their child to school when they're running a fever or their seriously ill\nBut if parents the community everyone can help us live by this thing because we know that illnesses do occur we do have bad weather and some occasions in their family emergencies but we want to um display the macho strive for less than five\nFor the entire school year few strive for less than five ... says when you're pretty much on your way to success [noise] well\nI Know I've always uh preached to my kids that are showing up as Ninety percent of success I mean if you don't show up you don't even have a chance and then it translates to you got to show up Ninety percent of the time to pass so hey I didn't even know that I had something going on there\nDon't agree on what we do know that also learning is is\nThat ... have your that you learn\nAnd uh learning as a learning behavior I don't know that makes sense but it makes me but you know so when you if you if you don't learn to learn in school it's going to make the rest of the life extremely difficult and there's got to be in we're in a time where you know we're always learning I mean the world's always changing\nSo it's just so important to show up and and for those kids that are having specific challenges I Know the ... ah the school district goes to great strides to reach those unique situation where every kid has health issues or an illness that's a little bit something different than we are talking about but\nFor just day in and day out oftentimes with parents in a work schedules\nThey can come up with you know reasons why a kid's gonna miss school but there's really never a good reason\nYou mentioned administrators parents should communicate with their administrators um there are some issues that we may be able to give you a referral information for\nUm someone may may be able to help parents um maybe there was a transportation issue maybe that's an issue with um we were talking pre show about uh people still being displaced from Harvey\nIf there is an issue communicate with your school counselor with us principal I'm with you a teacher some let them know what's going on and maybe there are some resources available to help you get school\nThat's really important 'cause oftentimes people are fake and well nobody really cares but perhaps if they reached out to their maybe starting with the teacher is that usually the best place to start and say hey this is a challenge that we're trying to work through here does the district you have any uh anything that they can suggest that would help with this\nAnd I know that ... go great strides having seen and and getting to visit with administrators from the school district regularly be ISD does a great job as well as most all the local school districts involved in trying to help the kids be the best they can be but it but again\nNinety percent showing up and if you don't show up how can you be helped and then whenever you're looking for that grade or you're looking to finish school you may run into challenges as well as having to go to court\nIndeed and we want to welcome any of our students um who has\nPerhaps gotten off course who have left school for whatever reason we want to welcome them back we want to let them know that we stand with open doors open arms to bring them back into the educational setting\nAnd help them get back on course back on track to help them to graduate and be able to move on to that next level or next step in their lives\nWell again the place for the kids to start the teacher and the local principle I guess at the school and there are for those that need additional services need additional help\nUh the district's gonna do all they can to come through and I know that like you say y'all have any I Know you've revamp the website there's a lot of great information on there and ah\nSometimes people assume that there's not help out there when when there is it's just a matter of making the phone calls and make an effort to get\nGet that help so if you're having a student is having trouble getting the school or hadn't been to school like they should today's the day that we can begin that process of turning around and reaching out to uh be ISD so be sure to end the best place to start is with the teacher right\n[noise] yes I Would say that the student has been wild and school who may be having some issues they're facing those challenges can reach out to their teacher\nWhether it's their teachers sometimes often it's a coach um sometimes it's an activity director but someone at the school school official that they are able to talk to and feel comfortable about sharing some things\nAll right we're going to wrap things up this segment we're going to be back right after this break you're listening to Roy ... show hero news talk five sixty kale vi\nArea high school football teams are jockeying for position is district plate gets underway\nThan in the past perhaps because things do move so rapidly and uh being being informed as the way to do that and tell people\nA little

somebody on\nWe don't bring 'em on with I'm wrong expectation so they'd be they'd be disappointed\nUm there's there's so many opportunities that we can kinda customize their their experience to make sure they get something out of it well\nAnd uh I Know your provide a lot of resources for businesses that become members and just being a you know\nLearning how to participate in the community that chamber does a great job of that and often times people say well I don't know how to do that and then I push him towards the chamber to say you know this is they're all about connecting businesses together and helping you learn how to connect with the public\nAnd an effective way and ah [noise] the right way or just like would be be helping you do business right\nCorrect correct the way you
