are multiply it All right I got chills when I read this piece by Piers Morgan for the daily mail listen to this given all the fire British donated perpetual outrage about Trump since he won the White House\nThis is truly a remarkable ... state of affairs of course America as liberals will respond to the shock poll in the way they respond to all things Trump with fury\nIt ... it in in I always get this right now in ... in credulity I always have a hard time with that word and by sticking their collective heads understand\nThe the morning is referring to the poll that came out this week that shows Trump at a forty seven percent approval rating according to the NBC Wall Street Journal poll forty seven percent\nObama was at forty five percent at the same exact stage of his presidency right before the midterms up twenty ten so Trump is according to the NBC\nMore popular than Obama was at this time in Obama's presidency how can this be happening\nThey will whale uncontrollably writes Piers Morgan what the Blake is wrong with people who like him they will how do each other's kale salads this is the end of planet earth they will sob in their normal understated manner [laughter]\nAll of which will be music to the ears of Trump a man who absolutely rebels and liberal hysteria because he knows it works for um there's this new poll proves the more Trump bashore scream abuse at at about him the more fires up his base and indeed the more fires up Trump himself after all that is part\nOf the president's a street fighting New Yorker who loves a good scrap\nAnd into each time writes Morgan he may delivered the biggest knockout punch of his presidency until recently it was widely assumed the Republicans would lose control the house in the mid term elections\nIt was being depicted as a damning referendum on Trump and historically most presidents like Obama take a whack in the midterms but now he says I'm not so sure\nIn fact I'd say there's a very good chance the Republicans will hang on to the house as well as the Senate and Trump will move on empowered and emboldened to what could very well be even bigger winning twenty twenty why is this happening he says\nWell first of the U.S mainstream media has become the boy who cried wolf their constant collective outrage over every tiny thing Trump says tweets or does much of a driven by commercial self interest has had you'd ever the bull affective diluting the impact\nOf that outrage barely a week goes by without some supposedly new Trump crisis fueling wall to wall cable news coverage\nAnd dire predictions of impeachment or even jail time for Trump yeah within a few days each administrators shouldn't threatening scandal quote unquote dissolves into a giant nothing burger\nShe says I look at Democrats today and I see a party that's learn\nAbsolutely nothing about how to beat Donald Trump and I see a president who is growing stronger by the day Trump has become a political Godzilla crushing everyone who dares challenge him and bulldoze his way through an agenda that is beginning to pay real dividends that it goes on to list all the accomplishments\nThe tax cuts the regulations the economy North Korea trade war with China trends for civic part all the things\nAnd he's clamped down hard on illegal immigration\nPiers Morgan says as I write this\nCaravan of thousands of Central American migrants most of them from Honduras is moving toward the southern border they intend to try to enter the U.S illegally\nIt's hard to think of a more powerful image to vindicate Trump's much criticized demand for a new wall isn't it as he tweeted full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border that caravans or a disgrace to the Democratic party changed the immigration laws now\nMorgan says he's the president is beginning to really enjoy himself he's exuding an Arab someone who's worked out how Washington works or rather doesn't and how to play the broken highly partisan system to his advantage\nLove him or load him Piers Morgan writes in this terrific piece\nThere is no desire to deny that he's winning once again I can only advise the Democrats to stop their ridiculously self defeating the state of perpetual Trump outrage and work out how they're actually going to beat him because right now he writes Trump is kicking your\nButt and he does not use the word but he uses another four letter words it's a great piece by Piers Morgan\nI wanted to share with you here on the Mike Gallagher show want to remind you

Eighteen thousand fill the arena\nAnd you know who who get those numbers on the left but I'm not and I I I'm not\nMaking an argument I'm asking a question who does get those those Brock Obama get those numbers I Am very\nCurious who gets those numbers on the left anyway\nI ah I Want you to hear about some of the things first to this one is very powerful about who we worship you want to want to play that one show him\n\nCenter of American Life so true\nAnd above all we know that in\nWe don't worship [noise]\nGovernment we worship God [noise]\nNow I ... it so I when I listen to these things this is just a habit of a lifetime when ever I listened to such things like whenever I speak I hear the voice of leftists in my brain\nIt's an automatic response to me it's almost ... how\nExactly is someone on the left responding and of course they load everything that was just said loaded\nSo that is to give away as to this very important distinction between left and non left do you do with water was just said if you don't you're not a leftist\nAnd what is it exactly that is a load some about it so let's go part by part let's begin again if you would show on with the kneeling and the

in it what is bad about that we Pratt proudly stand for our national anthem and our national flag\nAnd by the way I frankly\nDon't know the answer I almost always know what a leftist will say but I this one's a tough one what what are they going to say to proudly stand for the national anthem of the national flag is an act of white supremacy\nI it's a code word for bigotry\nIt's a dog whistle to Xena phobia want to I don't know exactly what they would find I Know they find it frightening and disgusting and the thought of Eighteen thousand people cheering for a further reinforces their\nDisgust but I I really want you to understand that it's a fairly recent vintage in American Life\nThat people would find a president saying we proudly stand for our national anthem and our flag to be disgusting let alone fascist okay this is this is because we have gone so far west\nBeyond where the left was even one generation we go next please\n[noise]\nNot government bureaucracy\nAt the center of American Life so\nAll right so hold on there so so so yeah so okay so what would they left to say what's wrong with their faith and family is the true center of the American democracy or not ... was a government them bureaucracy so you\nMay recall democratic convention a number of years ago we played it on the show a number of times I was I was actually at that convention I I heard it live\nWhere they ... the ... the or not narrator the dmc whatever term is used for the voice of a convention that you know the resident in voice\nGovernment is what Americans all Americans have in common or is the one thing all Americans share something to that effect\nThey really do believe that it has supplanted faith and family government and a bureaucracy\nHe's right about that see it it's four percent of the west as soon as the president says something to a crowd in particular it it is considered Neal fishes stick and all the usual adjectives thrown out\nBut I I really want to know from people what is wrong with that is faith and family not to the center the lynchpin of American Life should not be\nAdmitted that it's that it's gradually no longer the case of faith and family forty percent of Americans born to unwed mothers now and faces dwindling\nBut\nHe's got a good thing so that's a question to ask a a person of the left in your life mixed number three claim number three of the president\nAbove all we know that in\nWe don't worship [noise]\nGovernment we worship God [noise]\nIt was as if he took a line ... flying out of my mind that that he is I'm just saying it
