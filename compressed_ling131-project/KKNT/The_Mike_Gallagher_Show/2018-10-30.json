has been to see\nAn American Jews turn on Republicans and Republicans arguably have such a a healthy respect and and a sacred respect for the state of Israel\nAnd yet Democrats are often taking the side of the Palestinians a seemingly understanding this kind of violence and horrible things that Israel has to deal with on a regular basis demonizing and vilified Israel so along comes this Republican president who literally\nFulfills his promise of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nAnd how could Jewish Americans not embrace this president\nI suspect many do and I have a hunch that since President Trump fulfilled his promise to do just that with the embassy and acknowledging Jerusalem as the real capital of Israel that\nYou know there are a lot more there's a lot more Jewish support than any other Republican would have gotten or ... because believe me Republican and democratic presidents all made the promise to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and none of them came through until this guy\nThanks Selma eight minutes before the hour one open line now eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four five three I'm going to give

American as a human who loves truce these people are despicable\nJew and non Jews lying about this using the debts of Jews because they hate Trump they hate Trump more than they love the dead that is my belief\nBecause if they didn't they wouldn't use the deaths of Jews to crap on the president\nBut that is the greatest motivating force of these people the hatred of this man is greater than obviously greater than any love of truth\nTo compromise of the ... of the Anti Defamation league of various Jewish agencies of back all of the left the entire left it's a lying lying lying place\nI
