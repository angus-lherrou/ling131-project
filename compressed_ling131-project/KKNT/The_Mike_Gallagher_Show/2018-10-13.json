{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "And you want it to grow as much but the next phase as you start planning for a time when you get into retirement\nWe got to look at things differently it is not just about growing your money\nOkay you've got to take that money and you've got to have a plan that\nConsists of first of all really knowing what you want retirement to look like what's that going to cost so if you're gonna travel how are you going to travel how often you going to travel would are generally spend and travel\nI mean really drilling down on that so that there's no disappointments so that you don't have surprises on that and they'll always be some little surprises but that's very essential having a budget that we know what are the things we're absolutely want to do when we retire\nYou know maybe you want to take that trip around the world but if you can it's OK let's flush that out on the front and then then how do we build a plan to sustain your goals realistically when we got to have income we got to have income to replace the paycheck\nInflation adjusted income because inflation never sleeps I don't care about the consumer price index being low you're going to find out in retirement I've been doing this a long time that things go up more than you think\nYeah yeah you've got to have raises just like while you're working you get raises you got to have the same thing in retirement so we've got to have a solid income plan and that incomes going to come in whether\nThe market's up down sideways so we've got to make really good decisions about having\nReliable income to support our goals\nAnd you got to make a great decision about how to take pensions okay we've got to look at your lung jeopardy we got to look at your lifestyle if you're married\nDo you take the money in a lump sum oftentimes people can take their pensions if they even have it in a lump sum does that make sense upon your goals Jesus it's great for an advisor to take that money and invest it and get paid but doesn't really make sense for you let's explore that as part of the income plant and Social Security\nMy goodness don't make a knee jerk decisions with Social Security we got to make a decision for you the best claiming strategy based upon everything that you have going on in your retirement plan I can have ten people come in in a week and look at Social Security claiming strategies and they're going to be very very different\nYou know I'm thinking back real quickly to last week we had one couple come in and their strategy when we looked at it what made the most sense the best probability for success and their situation was\nFor the lower earner to take their Social Security early and let the higher earners take their Social Security at full retirement age that I had another couple that came in and\nThey're both going to take their Social Security at full retirement that I had another couple come in and they're both going to take their Social Security\nSoon as they're eligible because we looked at the whole picture but the bottom line is based upon the whole picture we want to make sure that we squeeze out the most income from Social Security because it is a great tool to work with the we got to have an income plan we get out\nInvestment strategies support your income goals as well as your goals and five or ten years and your long term goals we go to make sure that that investment strategy does what you needed to do we just don't want to have performance goals we want to have goals that support\nWhat we need our money to do you know I had someone come in last week and they're do it yourself or isn't idling insult anybody but they're making twelve percent on their money and a good market and they're all excited about that\nBut you know what they need some income from that money now and when I did it analysis is to Mars two thousand ... their portfolio could go down over thirty seven percent\nI don't know that that's appropriate so we want to make sure that the investment strategy supports what they're working on that is another important\nPiece and boy if I said it was a stay at a hundred times get Saddam Hussein next in tax strategy I Want to attack that took it I couldn't help I was so excited because so very often I call it the red headed stepchild because people they know what they what they wanted to do and retirement and focus\nOn the returns that they're getting they've got an income land they know how much money they need the money to invest it cuts strategies that making money on it and they forget that they've got a silent partner Uncle Sam Uncle Sam not really your uncle and he's a silent partner that you\nGot to figure out how silent he's going to be in your plan\nSo if you're like most people and you've saved in retirement accounts you follow the conventional wisdom\nYou've got a new ahead of time how\nMuch you're going to pay in taxes that's not really yours I hate to be the bearer of bad news but so very often when someone comes in and says oh I got a million bucks well if it did a retirement account you don't really have a million because you've got to pay taxes on it and depending upon everything else will determine your tax bracket so we've got to have\nA forward looking tax strategy so that there's no surprises and you keep\nYour income you keep it it's no good to make it on paper and then give it away to Uncle Sam we got to have a health care strategy to support everything she should get this plan we go in on the cruise and then we forget about health care and then the need for custodial care later on\nAnd one spouse has to liquidate just so many asset to pay for the other one's health care the custodial care needs because they didn't have a plan that could spill devastation so we've got to have that on the front and be realistic about it\nHad the ending mind and go forward and an estate planning strategy is also part of the picture we work all of our lives to accumulate our money and\nI Want to know that if something happens to me I don't pay more than my fair share of taxes\nAre harder money's going to go to who we wanted to go to our loved ones and that takes some tax planning strategies as well as the state planning strategies make sure we have the right beneficiary documentation make sure we have powers of attorney well were alive so that my spouse can handle any retirement accounts that I have\nIf I'm not able to do that or my kids as well as health care decisions that's all part of it so when you sit down for retire\nFit analysis\nWe're really going to drill down on what retirements gonna look like what you're going to do and retirement how you want to do things understand that what really is going to look like success for you in retirement\nEverybody's different some people just want to go visit their grandbabies ordering pizza and you know drive to them and not spend a lot they wonderful grandparents other grandparents want to help pay for college educations that we all want to do this stuff but I mean it's really important to them\nAnd take them on lavish trips we could identify that on the front end and then we really got to look at what's going on with your money from understand everything how much risk were taken away comfortable with the probability of success\nUnderstand taxes the whole works it sounds like a lot but I guarantee we break it down into bite sized pieces we give you the facts to make educated decisions\nSo that you can get to and through retirement successfully but it all starts with taking that first step to say hey you know what I'm close to retirement or in retirement I Want to make sure that everything\nThat we want to accomplish what we've done supports it and if it hasn't how we can fix it\nSo if you've done the heavy lifting you saved about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for retirement\nI Want you to pick up the phone will be one of the first time caller to call us for retire fit analysis\nAnd that number six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six I don't want to keep

get to tell you that we're going to congratulate you going to give you all of our backup information if there are issues and we decide that you like our help mutually does not like I helped going forward\nWill go from there but it's totally complementary I don't know how you could make a decision about when to retire how to retire\nAnd not worry about the rest of your life a less you have the facts in front of you you don't get do all his retirement so pick up the phone call us at six to three seven nine two\nFifty four Ninety six again six to three Seventy nine two fifty four Ninety six\nTalking today with ... she's founder and president F.\nP. S. P. N. associates science generally jak along side in the studio we've been talking about how to plan for specific retirement goals and in this last segment we've been talking about the different\nComponents of this plant why do we need to make sure that we're not overlooking as we get into retirement and we get into the here's where we are no longer able to save up\nAnd contribute to our retirement savings sell us just a couple of minutes left in today's show\nWhether your retirement goals are a world's cruise or that herd of buffalo\nThat my husband has his eye on what are your thoughts for us today\nYou need a this is contrite but that you need a plant yeah and what we do I tell people we plan with people\nTo build boring retirement plan and so you can have exciting retirement and that takes a little sweat equity and the front end really understanding that painting that picture doing the research\nAnd wouldn't it be great to know about things before they happen\nWell exactly that way you could get a little bit of a preemptive\nStrike on it yeah I like that but I like that term for that right [laughter] so we have to make sure we know what we're doing but number one on this that the common challenges in cash flow planning is he is not knowing exactly how much income you'll need and\nWhen you need it because when I talk to people about retirement see but I Know you do and I talk about retirement a lot sure when when I talk about your friends are you tell a micron fifty or sixty we will both have friends that are retired\nWhen I asked folks when they want to be in the listeners one listeners come and ask them all the time when you want to retire what do you think they always tell me soon or yesterday which already was there were well I just got my my my boss just told me I was now\nSay they say it's right so\nWe need to know exactly if we can if we can know when we're going to retire then we can plan for that and if we now another challenge and this is one no one knows that I guess you could control this ... and you don't want to but we were going to pass away crying\nBut if we knew exactly what we're gonna retire when we're going to pass away we could put together a proper strategy but we don't let it so we do know that we want to have a comfortable retirement when I talked to people about retirement we want to one of the main things I I hear as we want to have a comfortable retirement and you can define that different way some people\nWant to have what we call it accounts which they never have to want to worry about turning the TV on and see their stocks go down because they don't want to be in something that is dependent on Wall street for retirement and other people want to take a lot of risk so it's it's all different people different strokes for different folks we always hear that\nAnd so it's getting the proper strategist put together\nBut number two on the common challenges as not understanding the right questions to ask ... and I've taught\nOr if I had a nickle for every time someone came in and said gosh I never thought to ask my advisor that yeah right what am I fees or you know if you were in four one K. plan what are all these hidden fees that I hear about mhm then why is it my ballot is higher than it should be what what are these fees for\n... why are you charging they see all the things that my by my daughter's twelve now but when she was five she started asking why\n[laughter] [laughter] it's time for bed or any any because well because mommy said so [laughter] [laughter] I'm not saying I don't know how to ship the blame at home exactly that is still a king let's go get some I suppose [laughter] L L love it\nJust knowing what questions to ask and the financial will do because if you don't understand the financial world completely you're not going to not ask the questions because they're not even in your head yup yeah so that's one of the first things we do we sit down with folks who call from the show was we help them understand why\nWhy they're doing what they're doing why they should be worried about certain things and why they should not worried about other things it's all about the whys and we're going to talk about that more in the show was along with that that report on the financial planning for retirement workbook that produce university has put aside but I Want to make sure that people were retirement ready\nAnd retirement ready is a big term men and it means a lot more than people think but you need to be ready and no one can predict the unpredictable no one can do the unknowable I Wish we could but we can't be nice [laughter]\nBut here's that we can equal playing field and that's what we try to do let's equal to play field let's

the folks we also have our student intern Abigail Turner with us a great perspective coming in\n... college generation you have to have you guys in now you were mentioning earlier how you just got back from Canada to go yeah I was up there as well I wanted to ask I always loved the little frozen maple trees you could get they would tell us and put it in the snow and it would free we had\nOne knows it yellow [laughter] don't even\nKnow exactly what you're talking about how that those are delicious\nYeah aren't they [noise] so I went to Vermont years ago and I remember they sell the sugar candies that were maple right oh yeah and they were the first one or two ago but they get by I mean really to sway you get older yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but there's nothing better than real maple certainly Naples\nSyrup in every single gift shop in Canada and thank God I mean leaf shaped containers ha ha I mean this is such a tourist trap but you know it's so\nGood though it really is All right we're going to ask Abby how the exchange rate was in Canada compared America\nI'm so it wasn't because when you looked at the prices in Canadian dollars you know you figure it's about a couple of dollars less in American money\nWell my my grandparents and a lot of my family is from New England who Boston tall river New Bedford area and I remember we'd go up there on summer vacation back in the day and every now and then you get back and change when we would go to ... story\nBut in the U.S the subsidies candy Pettitte came back of the day yeah we get Canadian pennies or quarters back and they were not worth as much back then in fact if you try to buy a drink with a drink machine that they were quarterback dance you put a Canadian quarter in and it would bounce right through come out a little change return I don't know yeah nothing worse than when you're ... and you don't have another quarter but I don't know\nHow long have you in Canada and the tax rate OK thing it's Thirteen percent so you know well you you subtract a couple of dollars because that the American money exchange rate but then you got to add more than you think you do because of the tax rate\nYeah exchange rate is good right now I Believe so yes and so yeah but then the taxes are bad yeah yeah there there are real bad yeah I went to their taxes go for\nYou mean Thirteen percent were not money where's that going to use it as well I have no idea either\n[laughter] I just say it for a lot of health\nCare and I know well yeah they all have free healthcare right yeah yeah\nAll right so we got this article I read the article titled from forwards magazine and we've been talking a little bit of it because there are a lot of mistakes that people are making in the financial world don't even know it or they assume they're making mistakes so they don't do something which procrastination does a new one wants to save money but what is what's what's one of your favorite of the\nYeah the oil and um I like him or kill everything will work out fine that I think that's really a a millennial kind of perspective to look at it and my my dad died saying that millennials don't have you know they feel entitled everything will just work out fine I'll be fine or\nEven in the financial will see a lot of his two were guys or something you've taken a lot of risks they shouldn't take tone and uh we've got a very special segment right now inside this segment\nDon't buy don't buy that don't buy don't by saying well okay yeah All right now we've\nGot the you know when we talk about this thing everything will work out five right that's what we're talking about that's a mess right you just put money over here and everything that you retire and then you'll have plenty of money well people have looked at a company and we talked about this for over ... over the course of the last year and I do a money segment and we talk about a company named ...\nI guess they do a great job of promoting on all the little stock boards the message boards where people go and try to get advice which by the way that's the worst ways to go get advice for anybody [laughter]\n'cause you don't know it was given you the vice there you go your profile with someone who can event their own profile on line to Fifteen minutes to make themselves look like a multi billionaire investor and really they were just a Fifteen year old kid in the garage somewhere or if they're not getting paid by the company themselves a lot of times that happens to\nNow dry shift is famous now what what they do is they have a really good stories they're called a story stock and what they'll do is they move dry goods\nWorldwide okay shifts so that's why it's called dry ships they moved to dry it\nAnd so it seems like a novel concept well yeah that's pretty good I mean the big ships you see the big ships out in the water is gigantic tankers and all that yeah something problem is their stock is constantly being reversed split it okay so can you explain\nWhat that is because that's something that confuses me so much\nOkay so are you a regular split as like when you buy a company and that and splits two for one you hear about that every now and then you had a hundred she has now you've got to want to share yeah sounds good yeah of course the prices reflected on that so the two hundred shares is is like we're half the value of the hundred shares what's all the same\nAnd then but but confidence is high because why would they split why would they issued more shares if they weren't confident they were going to keep growing his may make some parts of the exact opposite of having confidence that your company is going to grow\nIs having non confidence that company is going to grow and you have to keep shrinking the shares okay to make the companies seem viable and it's more ... more cash so when you when a company issue shares\nThe company makes that money ... shares are out there at the end the general public\nLike let's say I I issue shares I make money at it gives me money on the company and then having now has the shares right and then ... year so you Thomas I don't make any money on that they may have the money back and forth here well dry shift what they've done is they've done something called reversed wedding\nRemember that yeah we actually had a great opportunity to talk to someone who helped write that original four O. one K. tipped\nTed Turner yeah there you go to road rules I Love that yeah but you know the the reason why the four one K. was established was because companies weren't having pensions anymore\nAnd a pension from a company promised a yearly check for the rest of your life right sure so what's the difference between a four one K. and a pension plan as it is the four one K. just do what you put money away tax deferred and you can put money in different savings vehicles or investment vehicles\nBut it doesn't promise your monthly yearly income it getting ready to do I get your halfway there yeah so it is yeah after journalists and the relay race of life it gets you around the track really good yeah\nBut then it's time for it to hand the baton off ... to somebody who specializes in kicking right through retirement there you go through and so they have the fastest sprinter if it had to to to get to that point but when you get to retirement\nYou need a marathon runner makes a lot of sense and so a lot of people don't have\nThat so we need to have that year we paycheck you know four one K. and it was not offered so how do we do it while we were all the money tax free into our own retirement plan and we built a yearly income component into their ... and if we build it right we have lifetime income for the rest of our life we can have increasing income if we use a marketing strategy\nAnd we can also have some of that money dedicated for long term care while\nWe include that into a total retirement plan we can also have something called a super will transfer so that when you pass away your children will get a tax free or your spouse will get a tax free income for the rest of your wife instead of taxable and now we can do something called ... and we plan where if you're worried about wanting to leave money to the next generation\nWhat if you could spend all the money you want it to today you're this year or in your lifetime short and when he passed away your children or whatever whoever your grandchildren you leave with money to get exactly or more than what you started with oh\nHardly a spent it and now you're leaving okay what are a lot of people have heard of this no and then and then when people see it actually in writing which it always in writing say are in disbelief number one\nThe main disbelief is not that is true because it's all backed up right mhm twenty five years in the financial never had a complaint I mean I I'm not just saying stuff suggest anything short of disbelief because their current plan or never told him about it a while and the main reason unfortunately\nAnd I have to apologize for the financial industry for this is that many advisors are compensated by keeping you at risk ... ... if you're going to a doctor and he was describing your prescription that had nothing to do with what you needed it it made it may be negative press instead of happy\nAnd you went to the doctor and say why were you prescribe this for years to me and he said well compensated by the drug companies see you on drugs I wouldn't be surprised well that's about what we're talking about here if someone's got you in the wrong place financially and it's not helping you a matter of fact is hurting you 'cause you're not building an income play in why they're doing it\nWell it reminds me how we really do have to take that initiative on our own ... and really search out and find folks who are you mentioned fiduciary in the past how important is to find someone who is a fiduciary and it's not just claiming to be working in your best interest 'cause that's really the heart of the conversation isn't it\nGo to the advisor who specializes in risk and ask them how to have a safe income plan and here's what you hear\n[noise] and that's unfortunate because if we are fifty two older than I started before I was ... I mean there's a financial arena and I want to make sure to build myself retirement plans I was called\nBack of the day when they the ... biography about me his beard on about our show when everything oh wow they called me the Mikey the financial world because I Try everything before I recommended ... okay and so maybe the life several commercial and so if\nI'm like a human guinea pig here than just rabbit and Peter Rabbit right so what are what I'll do though was not talked about something on the air unless I really believe in ... and we unfortunately in this financial world when we're talking about retirement planning\nMany people are ignoring that and they're hoping that every single just work out fine they've got a lump sum again lump sum great sure but until you can translate what that lump sum really means for not income for next year or ten years but for a lifetime but I don't want you but for your spouse\nAnd if he passed away two so which anytime you passed way too soon\nWe wanted we call it taken the limousine that happen right that's right but when that happens you want to make sure that whatever money you have put aside doesn't disappear it go onto the next to Ken doesn't disappear and go into someone else's pocket and that's called planning\nAnd it's not just financial sales putting in the best investments for today that's crazy by the way it is it is putting you into a plan and once we have that plan bill then we can take the leftover money money that you don't need for income and you can you can basically take risk with it if you want yeah but what you know what people usually tell me after we build the perfect plan for retirement was that 'cause I Want to put boring [laughter]\nI don't want to put this money exposed right yeah but I Do have a lot of people I recommend keep maybe fifty thousand at a Scott trade account or something like that kind of here and buy and sell some socks on her own or whatever that keeps your mind sharp yeah yeah yeah and it keeps them you know happy and researching and all that but it's even if they lost all that money\nThey still had okay they're still out there more they're yeah they're all important there the rock is the time it rock is there it's going to be there it's going to give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd this is very important to me it really is and I see way too many people have seen in my years in twenty five years I see people who thought they were fine\nUntil the market rip the carpet out from under him\nAnd then they had to rebuild all over again sort of like taking an ant hill over there you know and come back and they rebuild but all the time that could have been building a palace precisely it however that you're having to start over again and that's what happens starting over again is not any fun now and\nEspecially if you're already we're to the point where you don't need to take any risk because you already have the income you date for retired and we already have the money that could get you the uncommitted retirement but your current point or hadn't told you about ...\nSo if you're one of the next twenty callers as we leave for the

to tell you something else you'll hear this [noise]\nOkay that's the BS mail for the studio anybody as BS and then they reach over [noise] do that okay how we can do the show with the bell ringing yeah that's what that's going to be of All right you know when we got first Greg it's your first caller Greg good morning to you how can we help\nYou I just want to give you an added boy for your show I think going to shop for years I had a service flushes a hundred thousand miles\nI'm torn up place close and then I had a [noise] so\nWhen it was whatever I think Tom said come in after lunch and\nThey had a a tech drive me and I went a little speed bump that was around the corner they put it up on the left they checked it out they couldn't find anything and it was no charge\nOkay yeah that's Tom is a van around since Jesus was a baby out of the rest of us and um\nHe he feel notice he doesn't have any grey hair because he shaves it off but the rest of us still have it we don't call the plot we don't call great we called platinum for chrome one or the other platinum are grown but no time is a good guy and you're absolutely right thank you very much for that Frank thank you very much [noise]\nAnyway six oh two five away zero nine sixty one not necessarily soliciting Atta boys but we'll take them when the shops do a really good job and speaking of shops doing a really good job six so to fibroids zero nine sixty [laughter]\nOkay so one of my guys one of my shops gets a an estimate from another shop\nAnd it's an overheat situation\nSo they write down replace engine assembly replace radiator replace cooler reservoir and clean the oil out from inside the tank\nThey replace the one where you place here hoses with new ones recommended with engine replacement evacuating recharge air conditioning and that's part of this ... engines one just walk okay and then a service manager notes miscellaneous or for any part there'll be some miscellaneous on the parts so it's a seven thousand four hundred dollars\nFor over here ... overeat problem right now it is true that if they overheat it till the motors bright red and you can let your cigarette off of it then usually it toasted motor\nRight right okay head gasket to rings ... yep spirits and that all night on friday so they take it to another shop happens to be one of mine\nAnd I'm the shop says I think the shop the repair for three hundred and sixty eight dollars\nThey said it was an unusual situation because there was oil in the cooling system but what was the bad part about the oil and the cooling system was it was on the back side of the radiator cap\nOn the back side of the ceiling surface and why would there be oil on the back side of the ceiling surface of the radiator cap and folks don't really understand that but if you think about it that ceiling surfaces there to contain the cooling system correct so how do we get all on the other side [noise]\nIdiot that steals bad if you have oil on on the top of the cap right\nOkay but if they tested the cap and the cap is fine in the neck is good\nSo it it's a situation where that in a whole lot of other things just they felt uncomfortable so they flush the cooling system they did replace the radiator it had it had no pressure last whatsoever they use the same ready to cap\nThey found loyal and the reservoir and then the cat behind the wheel so they pressurized that again and again they drove the heck out of it and there was no oil transferred into the cooling system there was no oil transfer into the overflow jug and as a matter of fact once they flushed it there was no oil at all so there's no white foamy oil\nWhich would be in water into the ... er into the oil system so to suddenly celebrated with\n... you'll they check the oil and the radiator\nWhy you know I don't know you could draw your own conclusions but I thought it was kind of interesting that they said that the the spring park above the ceiling surface was where the oil was it's almost as if they filled up with the oil and then they stuck the cap and in the oil curled around the ceiling surface to the right side\nBecause it as as as the water expanded his will expand and pushed it up into the over the\nExactly so they drove the heck out of it then they gave it back to the customer and the customer drove the heck out of it and so far it's been almost a month now everything's fine so the customer went for Seventy four hundred dollar estimate for a new engine and by the way this is a Ninety nine Ford Mustang with a hundred and thirty one thousand miles on some\nWe as you were talking about this and maybe the to the shop that did the astronaut or the diagnosis on it never gave the never answered the question why did it happen well am I in the first place what was the overheating problem the first place\nOkay fair enough fair enough but I think the estimate tells us that replaced the radiator now it's true the radiator you'll agree the radiator could have been the after effect or the cause of an ovary didn't rights so it could have had an overheat and then but what was interesting in is an all of the things that they were going to do there is no service that\nThere is no thermostat so I'm going to draw the conclusion and give them the benefit of the doubt that it's a radiator inspected vehicle found the bypass host failed so that's what that's what that was [noise] and the vehicle was seriously overheated appears to have been driven for an extended period of time cause an internal engine damage\nThat's kind of this thing starts and runs just fine there's no sign of consumption of oil had gas gets blown or we've got an oil ... a transfer of coolant into the oil system so continuing on\nUm oil is president the cooling system oil present on the dipstick coolant hoses are swollen due to oil contamination of allowing the engine oil and system and the cool wants to mix\nNow the second shop just radiate or in it and put a bypass those on on the road\nSo they all of these things the shop said didn't pan out\nHave you ever if maybe nobody sort of the term shotgun repair [noise] that's one viable option a shotgun repairs each he sees a bypass hose and he says okay well this motors toast the radiator needs to be replaced all that kind of stuff yeah who is that what you're talking about a shocking river\nIf you either shock and repair because well we're not really sure\nAnd do it all okay for a little bit expensive for yeah for the ... yeah yeah they just know or they're not sure they're just saying okay well we don't really know positively what's going to happen\nYeah we're going to put it all and now ... given the shots of the benefit of saying if it didn't need a motor those are all viable things you want to do but where's the symptoms that was the first that was when I asked him what was the cost yeah when you went and did somebody look at it and say well another shop or another\nVenue or whatever it is called the cap also those there's oil in the water [noise]\nAnd then they came in the process of the process of why they came in\nAll right but in if we got oil ... going from the pressurized oil system into the pressurized cooling system they're going to be no fix\nWell as you were talking and I'm thinking that Mustang did not have an oil cooler most likely that went into the radio or such as you would find on it you know what a late model or dodge Chevy\nFair enough but it ... if we didn't replace your cooler and we drove but for lots of lots of miles and we didn't have any oil in the system\nThe question would be as worse they will come from and right now no one else correct but a JD\nHis jail and usually well you know what I'm seeing bad engine come in and they won't even run well and if it does it sounds like it's at her and then he said it had no oil and Noel ended ... so assumption yeah well and the only other thing is the big the big what's it called the big dinosaur in the room what do they call that\nThe elephant in the room as a business is low for the show\nAnd this person looked like an easy mark of the old days when the gas is actually a cat that's the elephant for him for getting a second opinion well\nLook at that you could into that thing in Albuquerque and got it fixed for three hundred and sixty six dollars and still come in significantly less than Seventy four hundred alright so folks getting another opinion who got on the\nOn the phone bill that would be Robert Robert good morning to you how can I help you\nGood morning I'm his rainy morning we needed a question I have two thousand two four to skate six on their two hundred and ten thousand miles always starts on the first turn of the case\nNow it's the third turn I took the Airflow off and I sprayed in the ah corporate cleaner inside the butterfly cleaned out of so called like carbon away it started right off the first turn now right back to the returns and the idea\nUm [noise] limber of outlook we'll call it and that will\nAllow the car the fuel not to come back out of the ... out of the carburetor well ... down now I've dad's very rarely seen that but that's one\nThings are to come up with okay well the little little plastic gasket there's like a donut or like a Frisbee on one end of the field trip to filter and you can see inside of it you know you can see the robber gasket worth\n... but what about the main well sleek and inside so if you directly\nIf he doesn't leak out inside outside externally than he can inside but he says you have to crank it a long time what we need to know is is when you crank it a long time or your throttle throttle into using the accelerator pumped to prime the engine so what's the answer to that\nIf I were to go out in the garage right now I go in\nI ... the accelerator three times during the day it three times it during the key it three times during the day and it starts\nOkay All right well obviously ... leaking out of the carburetor right All right and second they use that and the joke\nI don't know you you don't have to set the choked three times the first time you're going to say that the joke but each subsequent time he's prime and the carburetor mhm so that almost eliminates a carburetor ... anything about running black smoke out of the back evening as its run and rich\nBut the smell could like ... like you said it could we could still be draining the ball down on the external side so Ted I agree with him as just bully are cleaner off of it let it sit for however long you know what's going to have a problem\nAt the smell gets bad and the question is is is there any evidence of gas on top of the ... manifold that's the first place to start especially with that rah rah rah feels smell and what about okay\nWe'll have our air time it doesn't it I don't get\nAre you older okay but without a pet is is that we're going to answer that question after we find the problem on the car we don't want to chase our tail so how about a fuel pump it doesn't have the act\nIt'd be leaking also depending on the weather mhm on an additional issue to the fuel smell other than the start problem lotta feel pressure building up inside the fuel tank people kept leaking\nOkay he could also have an internal leak on the fuel pump we're pumping oil or gas into the engine\nAnd that would show a high level went into it but don't smell like ask 'cause he exiled that wouldn't have to in my opinion so anyway if that's what happened and then the fuel pumps on the right front well as you face the engine is on the left front of the engine so look down there and see if there's any sign of gasoline\nAnyway we got around Ted but thank you very much a sixty nine of on Seventy thousand miles that's just that's that that's a really nice what six oh two five awaiting zero nine sixty six so to five awaiting a zero nine sixty if you have a car questionnaire car problem um both of us have platinum hair curly hair\nAnd a boy and I died minus
