Mike yeah like [noise] I don't sound a little peculiar\nBut I always look for signs where there's something as important as the mid term election coming along powers looked for some sign and I went through this twenty sixteen and I remember very distinctly what happened I was looking for a sign that\nBoy ... going to win\nAnd it was a if you remember no one gave him a chance I mean it was really silly how what was it Ninety two percent was the likelihood that Hillary was going to win a court in New York\nTimes and I kept looking for a sign\nI kept saying something's gonna come along right before the election but it's going to give me hope but he's got a chance of winning the other words if somebody's going to know something that we don't know and if you listen to my show in twenty sixteen you remember what it was\nThere was a little blurb and the New York post reported that Hillary Clinton who was going to have her big victory celebration at the Javits convention center because if it's big glass ceiling you know a woman breaking through the glass ceiling and be elected president of the United states and all of that\nShe had a fireworks display plant and\nThey were going to shoot off fireworks along the Hudson River after she claimed her inevitable victory and a couple of days before the election there was a little blurb for the New York post\nThat\nBlacks\nPlanes that the Hillary campaign had quietly pulled the permits for the fireworks display and cancelled the fireworks display and I read\nThat you you are there I remember saying to you I think this is a sign I'm telling you this is a good sign they know something they know how silly it is to order hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe millions of dollars worth of fireworks as she could lose\nThe Hillary

and God and the Democrats got slaughtered in terms that concern you at all\nOh my gosh Ben ... was a blip on the radar for the mainstream media are you kidding me\nThe only people that were covered Ben ... were were conservative media outlets that are that bothered or dared to go up against the Hillary narrative on that the media gave that big pass it was a giant yawn an Obamacare for the mainstream media\nWas a you know like a curing cancer good thought that was the greatest thing in the world\nNo not even not even a little bit no comparison no comparison whatsoever you look at the polling numbers though and I I Want to go back to the story about this is really interesting analysis from that of all places CNN [noise] this is an analyst or analysis rather from a CNN reporter\nThe house for cash is that the Democrats win two hundred and twenty six seats and the house majority Republicans were only when two hundred nine seats\nThe forecast percentage and this is a CNN talking now [noise] although we haven't generally presented a percent probability the model that we have showing that Democrats hold the house I mean take over the house is about Seventy two percent chance\nSo Harry and to know Regina and says\nIt's not as if all hope his last Republicans indeed I Would point out that it's important to watch the margin of error it's still gives Republicans a decent chance of maintaining control\nAgain remembering that the model gives Democrats about Seventy two percent chance of winning control the house that's among the lower chances than most models give but it's in the general ballpark he asks do you know who else had about Seventy two percent chance of winning\nYou guessed it Hillary in twenty sixteen\nHe says it's not too difficult to paint a scenario in which the Republicans maintain control of the house maintain control the house rather not say Republicans with all those seats where they are favored as well as the streets were democratic candidates lead by about a point or less in the CNN forecast\nThat would leave Republicans with two hundred and twenty seats\nRadio news hour on Sunday afternoons at three on nine sixty the

Mexico they send back billions of dollars and\nWe take her to the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially that we're a little silly every government of Mexico me and my other states and the left thinks that that is a terrific thing even though all it does is in ... the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are unhappy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in significance compared to the possibility of more Democrats\n'cause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections that's what they do the imports Democrats\nMet an amazing thing is that done anywhere else in the world and the democracy we import millions of people in order to have you with elected\nThat's what it's about [noise]\n[noise] and it's a it's a big question we should have some folks on because the big question here how are they going to be stopped she misses me my fear is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people but not going to come to the border and they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back a thousand miles or Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what to distances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSo it's a fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to do with knowledge that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSee they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just prefer California 'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches was on the wrist is not landlocked to the bus to my knowledge\nSo I I don't ah\nI I have\nTo live in this make believe world that are on the left is created there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral weight to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to flee vast numbers want a fleet they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful or equally wonderful or non wonderful culture get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin American the American culture that's amazing I guess while you are so many Americans fleeing to under us\nWhy should they be why should they be impoverished they have food they've perfectly perfectly acceptable\n\nNatural resources the reason Latin America is largely an economic failure is because it's largely corrupt\nAsk our friends in Brazil\nIs is is there a few as ... as intelligent industrious people was the Brazilians but they're mired in corruption corruption is is the greatest problem outside of Iran on the face of the earth\n\nNot global warming my friend's corruption but nobody wants to talk about it because it sounds like you are attacking another culture but I Am attacking another culture I'm not attacking another race or another ethnicity or\nRace or ethnicity or insignificant culture is everything\n\nSo I I don't know what will happen at the border I I don't know how they will be stopped they have but otherwise if you want them in that you are allowing to yourself and to everybody else if you deny your for open borders seven thousand people want to come in\nThat seven thousand more voters plus there plus their families Steve this is the Democrats this is awesome\nI listen to the political pundits who are divided\nThis list will the scene being good and we were approaching this hugely hugely nation changing election possibly\nThe American people choose a Democratic House you are going to just see a two years of hate filled investigations of of the presidency to try to bring him down to try to bring removed justice\nKavanaugh that's all it will be will do nothing for the United states who will do everything for left wing power\nThe left brings not interested in the United states and its interested in power this is true in every country since lemon now talking about liberals but liberals are cowards they don't fight the left except Alan Dershowitz and and and the Ruben and a few others [noise]\n[noise] [noise] that's the state of things this uh this Monday I won't give me the show one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six so the question is who ... better or worse for Democrats or Republicans\nIf you want an open border it looks better for a for the Democrats if you believe that the United states has to protect its sovereignty it's better for Republicans\nThat's the answer but the point is they will undoubtedly be somebody will get hurt I it's very hard to imagine no young man is going a scuffle\nWith any American border enforcement agent and then get hurt and and uh perhaps a child there will be more cameras there as many cameras there was people\nAnd then the what they will be there will be the usual from the left look what look at the mean spirited president that we have\nTo look at these men and women and children though it's mostly young men but look at these men and women and children the cow\nIs missing Gina phobia of this administration that's that's what you hear and they will they will have the you know the appropriate assigned or so appropriate images that they will be able to show on\nCNN and MSNBC ABC CBS NPR PBS db ... do you do you do you do\nThat's what it is\nAnd the what's the excuse for those born in America to have these left bring values but I Want to know why telling you every single Republican running for office must be asked would you allow the seven thousand people to come into the country\nYes or no it's not a tough question it's tough for you to answer but it's not a tough question\n\nWhen a Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six Ryan and little added Georgia hello Dennis Prager here [noise]\n[noise] um well\nI heard you talking
