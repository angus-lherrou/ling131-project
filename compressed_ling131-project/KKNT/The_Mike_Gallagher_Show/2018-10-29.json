teach our children that you know not every toys their toys [laughter] I always love it when you go to a party and the hubs it's your kids or someone else's birthday part of the kid goes and he your kids watch every toy\nThat the birthday kid has because they haven't been taught right they grow up selfish everything is about them when they're babies everybody's a doting on them and falling all over them so that's a key difference certainly between\nI think not only the religious and secular but the left and the right the people are not basically good did you hear all the time with the left that\nOh you know you got to be understanding of the murder or you got to be understanding of their background and stuff oh yeah there is a real issue about whether the people would be good if left to their own devices and what is Dennis always caught something about the German tribes I think an Eighteen century\nOr they were so powerful and committed such evil and the answer was because they could\n[noise] so it's important to have a guardrail ths were good behaviors are defined and bad behaviors are outlawed\nOutlawed or even more importantly prohibited by ... by a garbage will have to answer to that that is so crucial because if you don't think\nThere is something or somebody that we have to answer to win this is all over it than anything goes right into your own moral compass that counts and yeah there are a lot of good people that have good morality and then you know they would never heard anybody\nBut I don't trust that I that otherwise you would never get slavery otherwise you would never get genocide\nYou can't believe people to their own devices so that's why we have laws but even more importantly if you think there is a good job that you're going to answer to win this is all over I think that produces ... much better but have you I think it's obvious\nUh so that's why I say born could behaviors or to find them bad behaviors are outlawed or prohibited by a God that you have to answer to [noise]\nSo what are we had we had fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and sons and daughters they did not come home Saturday\nYou know you you are you going to a synagogue and you think you have some sanctuary to use that phrase\nAnd and what was his two brothers I mean I Can't even watch or listen to the details 'cause it's too depressing and a lot of them older right it is just that you know they go about their business they don't bother anybody else and purely because of their religion\nThey are murdered by an evil guy who made it very clear right he's anti Semitic you know all Jews should be\nKilled I guess is what he's you know I'm paraphrasing what was going on purely because I I think he was upset because they were uh [noise]\nYou know part of a group that was helping immigrants come into this country even illegal immigrants send Neal here my position I'm sure during the day about illegal immigration\nOne can be outraged about politics and not do what antifa does not do what the pipe bomb or does whatever site he winds up being on it it looks like he was on the you know the other side but who knows it doesn't matter even though as evil matter what you want to say\nBut it's hard to imagine the pain of it all\nBut our I Will you know the difference Dennis ... leave religious discussion for him when he when he gets back\nNo one's better than Dennis on that in my opinion\nBut I sure hope that there is good God waiting for them\nAnd that family members can find some solace that way I Want to know your thoughts at one a prayer seven seven six but the worst part is probably not the worst part worst part is what happened to these people but I mean and I don't mind issue here is what the media and others have tried to do to blame Donald Trump\nThat she's a she's the atmosphere that he has not only accept it but uh you know in some way encourage\nHas led to evil as if it's first of all as if it's only on our side right they conveniently forget Steve ... and and that the guy there but it was a Bernie Sanders supporter as I remember and he he was committed total my ham right if not for the Capitol police that happened to be there with some of these congressmen\nShe would have wiped them all out let alone Steve Sebelius who you know almost succumb to his injuries but and I saw it all over the place that was a a\nFormer Obama official interviewed on Fox News let alone to the guy didn't even challenge from the news host on the weekend didn't even challenged him when he said oh you know comes from the top down and the kinds of things he says and it kind of things he encourages his supporters to do that's why we have this kind of violence when it's been going\nAn forever not to mention that and and you certainly uh you can't just blame the president for any particular supporter of his that commits man whether it's the pipe bomber or in fact been this guy think winds up being anti Trump\nMy right he's ... he's on the other side it doesn't matter they're off to get the president at every turn whatever he does is got to be bad and it's part of the you know\nHe he's the worst president never should have been elected uh he's evil he's a bumbling fools all those characterizations they hate him with a passion\nSo everything that happened in this country that is bad\nIs President Trump's fault and everything that happens that is good that President bombs credit to his credit if you don't believe that just ask and he'll tell you that [noise]\nSo this is what we have going on it and you you can't avoid politics even in something so awful here and even some of the rabbis there was a march\nIn my neck of the woods in the San Fernando valley and you could just hear at all which is the spirit of the country and the sea encourage meant to this kind of thing from the even if they didn't say his name you know who they were talking about and I know what happened\nI bet you all of you out there and knew that it would happen that one way or another they were going to blame him for anything that happened including people who are against him none of it matters and we'll get into\nThis later I I think in this first I Want to talk about the media and the press oh what they've done to this present butter relates here relates here to these family members um that will never come home again because of the anti Semitism\nUm look this is the greatest country in the history of the world but there are going to be evil people in it they're all going to be crazy people there are going to be this is what I say a two blacks who say that as a you know\nHatred and bigotry against them and uh the racism in this country yeah you you can't outlaws you can't get rid of it totally they're always going to be people like that\nAnd there's nothing you can do you just ... and here's the other thing in this horrible incident thought ... luck plays a lot in life\nThat are the you know I think some there's always someone who doesn't go for some reason and then they have to think the rest of their lives why wasn't of my time [noise]\nSo it it it's very difficult as I said and you you can't imagine what these family members of going through I'm In it and it's not just them is ah the remember the black church\nWhere the guy comes in and whatever his name was any they just kills people because they're black which is meaningless being black tells you nothing about someone\nOr being Jewish tells you nothing about their values and who they are being Christian right Christians are under attack in this country that's the one group that it seems to be okay you can attack them you can get away with it right 'cause it's okay in this country\nAnd I had to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer me except for what I'm kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial can you imagine the outcry and the further device on this if that's even possible mature that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that the ... legitimate discussion to have about\nWhether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the cries to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people wanted him to go you know he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so block corrupt is not by any means and incitement to violence\nThe other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people there'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they're beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes was stores that are not true the latest example did you hear this one NBC was hiding spot Qatari evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's one it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that you didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John\nI think I got something on Shawn he didn't hear that bit of news yeah this so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters\nTo media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so they're no longer objective reporters and a part of some sort of left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nTo the detriment of the shows so for example out talking about and the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if a mother's didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime catch this shelter also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother a father [noise]\nHow come that's hardly ever Porter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she lives on Fox ... use even though he more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lacked the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank accounts they just don't have the right documents\nSo of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports and so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own decisions\nLet me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right let me know what you're saying\nWhen a predator seven seven six mark guys lumber Dennis [noise]\n[noise] here's a million fixing\nSort of go by the shooter as of a hospital for this
