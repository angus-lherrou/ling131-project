C. law enforcement officials have told authorities are totally I've told reporters\nAt him that this pipe bomb intended for the White House was similar to the ones to send to the homes of Obama Clinton and billionaire investor\nAnd major Democrat donor George Soros which was discovered earlier this week the devices appear to be rudimentary but functional\nThe White House addressed device also contained projectiles also moments ago the New York city police department are confirming that\nThe time Warner center in New York City where CNN has a bureau has been evacuated was not immediately clear who the package there was addressed to CNN evacuated the newsroom as a precaution I'm also again the\nUnited States Secret Service edited intercepted too suspicious packages addressed to Obama and Clinton or earlier this week so this is again this is why speculation as you're responsible it's not\nA just sit around and say now I mean what what does this do to your narrative that you think the Democrats are behind it uh I guess the if it's a Democrat\nWho's behind this do you think sending a package a pipe bomb to the White House um\nChanges that that that theory we have to be responsible\nLet the Democrats with their stupid wild speculation about Trump being behind the murder of cars shockey\nA ... in the in the turkey constantly let them run their mouths and do all that kind of crap we we shouldn't we shouldn't do that and I don't believe we should speculate but obviously many people disagree with that's okay that's what we're here for eight hundred six five five Mike\nHere's Darrow on this breaking news story hey Darryl welcome to the Mike Gallagher show how are you\nAt your watch like pre shake you stand on on the situation because it's very important that uh we don't get these people\nIt's kind of credit because it's just\nA prominent party to a Democrat because the ex president former president and secretary of\nThe United States Senate crime against any former president all high stakes shield\nFrom the United states crime against the people you know so and then and then we have to realize that one day out president ... the former president do we want things like that happen at hand\nYou know so we said we cannot allow them to be credited any party when they caught because that's unimportant they committed a crime and they should get punished but I find that they committed\nAnd it doesn't matter what your political affiliation is male one and I know how to write it does it does not matter thank you Darryl I appreciate very much it's kind of you I again\nI but I get the speculation I understand cynicism I understand I'm deeply skeptical way we're we're treating the the ... the the the arena right now we're in the arena we're fighting the top of a a tough battle\nAnd there's some nasty ugly vile stuff happening out there for crying out loud somebody through Boulder through a house majority leader Kevin McCarthy his office\nIn Bakersfield, California\nUm we've seen the the angry mobs and the and the the viciousness of people\nChasing people out of rooms but again this is this is not limited to Democrats Nancy Pelosi was harassed at some of them together day by a bunch of a loud mouth or angry people who were cursing at her and calling her name's assure her out so again we got to just take a breath we got to take a step back\nAnd we need to be calm we need to be adults we need to be responsible and it's not responsible for the moment there is a a breaking news story like this of reports of pipe bombs being sent to the homes of the Clintons the Obamas but White House CNN shore oh\nI've got a caller here Ron suggesting that these bombs are are are being sent to try to make the Democrats sympathetic\nWell then why would why would the evildoers why would the monster sending these send it to the White House\nChanges that narrative you just can't do that you you you just got to have a responsible reaction to this but listen we need to be about trying to understand what's happening we need to stay focused we need to know what the stakes are nobody is is going to vote or not vote because of her report of pipe bombs being sent\nTo prominent Democrats and the White House remember according to the latest news the White House now has also been targeted so this transcends political differences let's be Americans let's stand up against evil\nAnd let us know the difference between right and wrong and not get so swept away by our political differences that we wouldn't want any harm to come to our political adversaries because\nThat that's not what America is about [noise]\nAnd welcome to the dentist print your show coming to you today from yet another city as I continue going around the country\nMuch of the of the six weeks I Am\nNot as a major event in Dallas for\nK. sky my local stations here in Dallas it's sold out to the best of my knowledge but [noise]\nWho knows if they're not the last minute tickets [noise]\nWell every body of the the big news and to to the extent that I actually turned the news off this morning in my hotel room is of course about the various ah non functioning bombs that were found\nAt the ... mailboxes or whatever maternity hasn't box it's hard to imagine a mail box at the Clinton or Obama or Soros homes\nPicking mailboxes regular\nRegular homes are regular people but nevertheless doesn't matter that it's disgusting whatever it is it to I have no idea who sent them or put them there an nor does anybody else\nIt wouldn't surprise me if the person who's on the right wouldn't surprise me if the person's on the left wouldn't surprise me if the person is just looking for attention as deranged nothing would surprise me ... and but uh the uh I ... my my real\nBut to like say my real reaction all my reactions are real but my primary reaction is that I don't think it's worthy of around the our coverage\n\nThere are things that I think that do\nAnd the uh their their screen before they get there they didn't even they don't even make them to the houses are in the case of these prominent people so it's not even right to say mailbox they were addressed is more accurate they addressed to these people\nAnd the uh the world to CNN and made it to the CNN location\nSince there have been so many hoaxes of all left is trying to show how bad right it's our I they're they're a list on the Internet of all the famous swastikas and new shoes\nThat have been at universities and elsewhere which were actually put up a by people on the left in order to blame and the rights\nThat I have no idea what does happen now I'm I'm not an all saying that that's what happened here I'm just saying that one\nHas no idea who did it ... whoever did it should be prosecuted to the or the tire extent of the law I look I\nHave long argued that people who simply email death threats should be prosecuted and sent to prison\n\nThis this uh a death threat\nBut desperate to a president or is a is prosecutor bull by the death threats to a regular civilian is not I I don't quite understand why are we we are obviously the president needs to be guarded more than anybody else there's no question about that with the president is left or right\nBut\nWe are all created in God's image and infinitely valuable and a death threat to any any human being is a is simply vile and if you rearrange the word the letters a vial you get evil it I Wonder if that's a coincidence I have no idea it might be a coincidence but it is what it is\nSo I I don't have any tolerance for this stuff I don't I don't think the vast majority of you do either\nBut I have to say I found I found that ... unbelievably on compelling television news to watch her more and more people interviewed saying less and less subtle blamed the people being interviewed\nWhat what I mean they say\nIt's the twenty four seven new cycle is an issue unless you have but you know a vast amount of opinion which which of course they do sometimes in the guise of news which is a problem [noise]\nBut uh otherwise it in terms of news you know my feeling it's it's largely a waste of time\nIf if there's nothing important to be learned about you know we all have limited time on earth she take our time ... you know I felt that when I was a kid I actually wrote in high school\nAnd I found a paper recently somebody loose it after finding it after all these years\nAnd I ...\nI Want to I Want I was a junior in high school and said I Want to prove George George Bernard shaw wrong\nWho said if it's too bad youth is wasted on the young\nAnd by so I've I've known that anybody could die at any time and that even if you live long it's still a limited little blip on the\nTime a radar of life and so you got to not waste your time I mean I waste plenty of time believe me\nBut there are things that\nI at least I Know when I'm doing some of my hobbies were just playing hearts or whatever it might be I Know I'm wasting time so to speak\nBut okay I live with that but you do is if the problem is when you watch news and you think you are not wasting time you think you're becoming better informed that that's what the raises the issue to me\nSo according to the machine the wall street German or Wall Street there what I'm saying that he ... Germany to some I'm looking up while I'm doing it second caravan gathers in Guatemala's migrants try to avoid traffickers\nCharity work because she knew dynamic is migrants bad together to seek to avoid hiring human traffickers and find more safety in numbers on a dangerous track so there you go [noise] I like to know shut has anybody asked the Democrats\nAre ...\nHas anybody asked Democrats what is your what do you suggest be done with the people on this caravan\nI haven't seen anything on that matter would love to I I I think people need to take a position on this\nLook folks if this caravan gets through then there'll be a number one I guess a big chunk of Central America will simply moved to the United states because people will feel sorry for them I feel sorry for them I give you my word\nI feel every bit as sorry as anybody on the left to the extent that the people on the left feel sorry for them and just don't want to use them as future democratic voters\n[noise] but they have to be stopped if this doesn't make the case for the wall then nothing makes case a four of wall\nMean businesses exactly why you need it I don't I don't want to I don't want to put Americans in the position of pushing families back physically fighting with families\nAnd it's just not fair and it it it's not fair to this country it's not fair to these families it's not fair to a first and foremost these guards our people representing us but they can't be allowed in\n\nBut I wouldn't I I really want to know what a what positions leading Democrats have taken\nLetterman but in the next caravan and what about the next caravan\nWhich is a very big deal about the second caravan some today's Wall Street journal even as a caravan of thousands of him during migrants makes its way across southern Mexico and why Mexico ... such a small or border\nWhy don't we why don't we work with Mexico to build the wall that it's an added infant during Porter\n\nThousands of having to another caravan as forming in its wake thousands of them during migrants gathering the Guatemalan city near the border with hunter is Tuesday\n\nRemember it's a Honduras two countries over Guatemala is the country to the south did I say a border with on the wrist if I did I was mistaken I met with Guatemala\nThousands of hindering migrants gathering the Guatemalan sitting near the border with ... Tuesday it's yesterday to prepare for a new caravan\nThat would follow in the footsteps of a larger group currently marching to the U.S Mexico border posing a fresh fresh challenge to Guatemala and Mexican authorities seeking to contain a surge in mass migration\nAll they really they're seeking to rally other Guatemalan to an extent our church on charities assisting migrants some activists say as many as twenty five hundred and ... who crossed into Guatemalan recent days have gathered in the city of chicken mullah\n[noise] near the border with Honduras but estimates of the size of the new group very widely from that number down to a few hundred\n\nThe migrants say they plan to head to see does take coon among the Guatemalan border town that was overwhelmed by a larger group of migrants who rushed into Mexico over the weekend some five thousand migrants who were marching northward than Mexico's southern Chiapas state\nBecause uh my first commitment has to be the troops otherwise is no reason to listen to me\nAnd so I I just don't know I Would like proof that Soros is funding these people they wouldn't surprise me in the least and yes Carlos is entirely right his aim is to destabilize western civilization that is correct the man is a force\nChaos there was something sicken his soul I I wrote a piece on him many years ago you could look it up those Prager George Soros that should generally do it because they're in heat his\nHe has\nAnd the legion ... to ... to to know group no people no nation no he has an allegiance to his\nVision's that's what his allegiances to he\nHe identifies with with nothing no again no nationality no religion it it's it's truly the rooted human being\nWho wants to approved see one let me see I I said this many many years ago and I haven't set it in many years to you part of what makes some leftist tick\nIs they do not have an allegiance\nTo any identity beyond themselves and humanity whatever that means it leads to humanity doesn't really mean much but in any event that would be the the their relief agencies to themselves and to humanity\nTo no nation to know a religion and therefore they are very uncomfortable with people who do have\nAn allegiance to a religion culture\nNationality they they essentially loved them yesterday I read to you\nWant us up at the European Parliament they plaque that is actually at the visitor's center at the European Parliament about how nationalism leads to evil\nAnd I did it at a lot of the show yesterday was on the antipathy\nTo nationalism on the part of the left and how good nationalism is such a good thing bad nationalism is a bad bad everything is bad I mean there's there's nothing that can't be bad nothing religion can be bad or anything can be bad\nSo obviously we're talking about good nationalism\nYes cheesecake can certainly be bad not ... not tasteless but bad for you that was the question posed to me and my earphones from Los Angeles or by by engineer triple gee when they Prager seven seven six\nAnd this is a a this is a real real issue my friends if this caravan issue was not addressed then essentially\nAnybody who does not want to stop them is by definition for open borders they're lying to themselves and they're lying to you\nKnow anyone who was not prepared does not seek to stop this caravan is by definition for open borders and\nOpen and open borders let's be clear means no countries\nWithin a Springer show live from the release your pain free studio\nYou're listening in on nine six\n[noise] here's a nice\nThing the new now Reagan was

New York City which is home to CNN was evacuated along with shows his office in Florida there are no reports of any injuries\nWell all of those suspicious packages had things in common but NBC's wall Ellen points out one difference\nThere are established protocols to detect things like that sense of south things like that um we don't know exactly how far they got along through the system [noise] um we know they were ... they were stopped in that case the Clintons and the Obamas at a at a sorting facility artist reading and so in somewhere [noise]\nUm I was saying before and the case of George
