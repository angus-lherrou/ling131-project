{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "And traditionally that's going to be your financial\nCounselor or whatever you want to among stocks and bonds maybe some more mutual funds maybe some more ATF more bones in stocks\nAnd I say that is not a plan I'll say it loud and clear okay to me asset allocation is what do we need the money to do do we needed to be a paycheck now do we needed to be\nMoney in five years that we're going to use to buy a car do we need it to be long term money that's going to be there if we need it for health care many years from now do we need it for an emergency fund if tomorrow the air conditioner goes in\nIn Arizona and we need to buy a new unit because we don't have time to find out if the guy who was telling us we need a new unit is you know is telling the truth or not we now have a new unit right to fix it [laughter]\nTo me that the asset allocation because we're going to use different tools like remember it tells you a while back that when we built our first house used a rock to hang pictures ... ruining my pictures well enough that's not a good tool\nTo me at a bank and mail it to the wall you want to use him both the same thing with asset\nReal I mean if you have too much risk we probably want to look\nFor different tools okay so for example if like most people if you're you got a real law in the stock market and it's all for appreciation okay\nThe market goes up you got a great paycheck that if the market goes down you're selling off shares that you're never going to get back but you really need that to be reliable income mhm if you want to stay in stocks maybe you want to be more dividend producing stocks\nYou want to do something that whether the market goes up or down you're getting a income from it\nMaybe one or just being a conservative portfolio that focuses on income that's what I'm Talking things that will generate into whether the market's up donors side with because that's what we're trying to accomplish that emergency fund in today's environment I'm hard pressed to tell you that I wouldn't want to see some money\nIn a bank account or a CD or a money market just they're safe and sound so you can write that check sometimes people use a home equity line of credit to do that and it's low interest rate environment\nBut the key word there is some money because there are people who you know they they are worried about volatility they use what happened in two thousand natives are as a reason to keep their money locked up in ultra safe thing to sit in on these savings\nAccounts your saying some money there yeah and but not all good\nPoint and I'm so glad you brought that up because the other side of the spectrum is having everything\nEarning no money then yeah we call that going broke safely ... that's what's happening you will never get your money to catch up with inflation then that's another reason for that risk analysis even if you're on the back let's figure out you know what you need that money to do that's why you need the analysis\nTo see do I need to position things different like we don't certainly you shouldn't\nRisk all your money as well you should not have all your money sitting there earning max\nTo two percent because inflation's gonna just a road that you're never going to keep up with the cost of health care very very very good point so asset allocation according to your plan planned first asset allocation\nWhat tools can we use to do the job we need\nThat portion of our money to do okay and and our job is like I said if we want income in the short term there's only a few tools will go to the show you what those tools are will show you the pros and cons and strings attached to each one gives you a high level\nEducational no so you can see where you're most comfortable but we got to know what we need the money to do\nThis a big talk about active versus passive management huh okay what's the difference in that\nVersus passive management passive management is you know the van got approach\nThere's a place for all of this than a portfolio once we know we need the money to do but again active and passes management is just about investing your money and returns mhm of first plan what do we need the money to do\nLet's get the right tool so if we have some we need income in a very complicated market were bonds really their heyday is is is over as interest rates rise bonds have done very very well for a long period of time it's interest rates rise bond values are going to\nGo down that's just the fact of life mhm stock markets volatile\nSo if we need income in the future but we want that money liquid and we don't want to tie it up and in in you know a fixed contract\nMaybe we want we want an active money manager portfolio who understands\nWe want this money conservatively one income from it we do want home runs we want singles yeah the marketing implodes we don't want to upload with the market goes way up we just want some nice income from it that's an active manager they can do whatever it takes to get up there\nAnd that's their expertise that's what they're doing all day every day a passive\nPortfolio and the other hand is here's where we're going to be and here's what we're going to be okay and for a long term money like I'll give you an example of my kids when they're raw mhm I've got them in the S. and P. five\nHundred each year for part of it OK long term\nVery low no hands in the pie no management these were just putting it in there were constantly dollar cost averaging in or they are I shouldn't say maybe they'll think I'm doing it but I Know [laughter] and that's good for that right but if someone needs\nIncome they need\nYou know you can't just do pass it because the markets not passive mhm okay bond markets not pass this dog yeah it's not pass as people think that neutral finance your regular\nUh everyday mutual fund is active management no no not well how to manage man for the stock holders 'cause internally they're buying and selling and generating fees for the stock holders but and the broker dealer\nButton but not really because each mutual fund has a mandate to let me just give you an example it's high yield bond ... totally out\nThe perspective says that that money manager no matter how brilliant they ah has\nTo be in that high yield they have to\nBe at higher bonds they can buy and sell all the time but they get to stay in ... they can't say oh wait a minute inflation's high that's a bad move are going to go to cash but we're going to start\nGoing into real estate investment trust them to go to alternative they're going to stay invested\nAnd so I call that being here in ... that's not active management now if you have a manager who can go can actively move wherever they take to get you what you need that the active management so there's a place for both the portfolio he out first we have to decide what we need the money to do\nWe're talking with Phillip ... founder and president if he SPN associates I generally jak alongside and still is what about its things other than just stocks and bonds are are there tools to include\nFor a at Stratfor a portfolio that that are outside of those traditional stocks and bonds\nYeah so we we believe that that yeah the the old playbook stocks and bonds\nIsn't going to cut that going forward so we need to have some alternative financial products OK okay and I'll just I'll just mention one and and again we're not products and chip where's the Lucian censure but the old playbook of stocks and bonds just is not going to cut it because\nBond value is going to go down when interest rates rise and that's not typical usually stocks will go up on the stocks will go down bond to go up not any more in this low interest rate environment so we need to add\nOther vehicles I could make a very good case if we're looking for income a good alternative to that is some of the money in a annuity strategy okay different types of annuities and they're back but you want a strong company want to understand all the pros and cons and strings attached\nBut that you have some really strong contractual guarantees whether the market's up down or sideways whereas with bonds you could lose value it might be a very very good place for you to do we should do a whole show in the future\nOn annuities because people either love to level or love to hate him because they don't understand yeah hey there's not enough education on them and they're not right for everybody and let me say this if you don't have a plan first please don't buy an annuity please don't buy stock please don't do life insurance have the plan for\nUnderstanding what you need to solve for\nAnd then look to see what tools you can use and I don't care if it's called paper bag\nAnd duties not either good or bad it's either appropriate for your situation with your risk tolerance and what you need to do or not\nThere are different types of annuities so buyer beware but yeah that's a good alternative today\nMany times if especially if people who don't have pensions Social Security optimization really making sure within your tax situation in your overall picture wherever you are in that spectrum\nYou need to pick up the phone and call for the retired fit analysis and that number to call us is six\nTo three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety ...\nWent either will happen we just do things will happen if we get older you know we never know when the news is going to change but we know there's always going to be news to watching the news it affects our retirement as we get closer to retirement shore yeah we want to make sure that isolates over money from the day to day actions\nOf the foolish view out there that could make the news and then goes there all of us\nOthers to have to\nScramble and wonder if our retirements going to be the way it is just look at September eleventh two thousand one member that you can make the actions of a few idiots changed the world no doubt that may still change the world if he ever\nFly now when we go through all sorts of stuff just to get on the plane we've taken a lot of our liberties away because of what those people that they would bring a drink on the plane the more you can go in the airport in pay\nFive times a year for a while but but it's just about shaping your plan to make sure that regardless of what happens in the future you're going to be fine yeah\nThat makes a lot of him I mean you're talking about liberties taken away their code I can only imagine that you know the volatility of that market can take away your liberty of getting like let's just be a real we all may like that cup of coffee every couple of days or every day and and it can take away that literally that we have as we had an\nUltimate freedom as liberty being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it and and you can have liberty and freedom in retirement if you say your plans up correctly I just the way too many people who were\nBelieving that song and dance of where they currently are or maybe they're doing their own plan and they just said to all their money tied to the market going up ... in ... and it's like a balloon is hot air balloons you see every now and then the memory now and then it starts to say\nYou know and we back the comic book days back in the day or the cartoons when\nWhen the hot air balloon was going down what what is the first thing you do they do the sandbags over whether to retirement plan starts to sink and you're ... you're thrown over the sandbags which is too much risk oh sure but it keeps going down because you waited to all get now there's this new and there's no hot here\nWith me right now out here in the oil is coming down the hot air retirement is income yeah edit refills the balloon\nIn this don't believe those big balloons were talking about refills them so they continue to float and float higher and higher yeah never coming down next door to make sure our income plans are like that too so there are strategies for creating and preserving\nRetirement income and a lot of people are overlooking does we we have something we when we sit down with radio listeners we go through the financial spectrum it's called ... and it goes all the way from bread to green and everything in between and you should have money in each and every one of those categories okay but unfortunately so many people were like the old seesaw they have all their money at risk\nAnd none of safety and none in income\nAnd so it's like the the big fat person on the seesaw sitting there and your way up and they're not coming down you gotta have proper about proper balance has always been the key but what is that what we see that's overlooked so how do you get from wondering if you have proper balance to having that proper ballots where the worries are taken away\nWe have a three step process that encompasses twenty two different steps that go on behind the ... doesn't really wow so three steps I think it's pretty good I like that yet I've never a good dancer but I think they had one called the two step right\nTo do this was one on one more dancer chicken [laughter] but uh it's about having\nThe right income and an income strategy built in any financial plan turns it into a retirement plan and so I Do you you know and brought this I'm adamant about this because a retirement plan is one that has income but so many people out there I think they have a retirement plan because our planet the current financial planner who may or may not be produced cheery keeps telling them everything's fine\nAnd maybe it is maybe it is it but I don't like the word maybe when we're talking about lifetime income no you either have lifetime income that's guaranteed for life that is growing and it gives you income and it's protected or you do there you go there and it was pretty cool it's like flipping a coin either it's heads or tails if it lands on sales in your broker keeps saying that says\n[laughter] try to broker\nYou know or maybe it covers it up and what what what you see what ended up but here's what I Want to do let's make it simple\nAnd we're gonna we're going to open the doors even wider this week 'cause we're gonna we're

to root out\nHe is a best selling author winner of many awards including ... again like I said earlier in the program I could go on and on and studio with us as well as Chris the rocket man brought our now\nCoach you were talking about financial dignity before the break and it reminded me I'm going to open up and probably get left out a little bit here [laughter]\nWagon again yesterday when I was a preteen and so you gotta think like eleven twelve year old Thomas there was a band called ... that was back in the day that there were these kids they all had long hair\nSo I had grown my hair out because I thought it was cool and trendy fad I go into a gas station one day to pick up a bottle of pop bottle a coke or whatever and the ah clerk their refers to me as a female instead of the male cut my hair the next day some little dignity example there just to kick off the segment\nUnless your hair comedy is about down on my shoulder and I've seen pictures would you would not much here at all you have yeah is that after the episode [laughter] or tablet eggs on him or her dignity that right right well yeah it's it's on again\nYour terms so financial dignity though you know doing what you want when you want where you want with whom you want that's financial dignity and we see so many people every single week they'd come in from the show we talk to them\nAnd they are wondering if they have what they need put aside and places they should have it to get to retirement they want to have and unfortunately well fortunately or unfortunately unfortunately sometimes they don't but fortunately there are they're thinking about it so that we can get them on that right past mhm we call it a critical thinking\nAnd its benefits we look at the benefits of of what what you're doing right now versus the benefits of something you could be doing ... and that should I mean to its features advantages and benefits and why would you make a decision that didn't benefit you completely and as much as it more of than anything else out there\nYeah I I Would imagine it's just not making the true comparison not not nearly being educated\nYeah we go through what we call the financial stress tests with every single item that is in your current portfolio while and then we compare that to what we would recommend is independent financial produced here as we can go out across the world and find things that makes sense to you know one of the things that are largely I keep seeing it over and over again from people that come in from other planners\nIs these other planners are pushing like crazy these days something called a real estate investment trust otherwise known as a rate OK called rats before to analyze that that is a real estate investment trust is when they're being pushed by financial professionals they get a pretty good commission that's what I Wish that\nAnd many times it comes right out of your return oh okay so if you are right out of the money put into let's say you know what a hundred thousand dollars into a real estate investment trust\nAnd the person you're buying it from is not a true for do Sherry the hundred thousand dollars you put in Ninety One thousand or so goes to work for you guess where the other nine thousand Ghost Wars on guests Tom and I was trying to\nGet on the person sounded okay that makes sense no not at All right so that's a media loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's that real estate goes up like crazy now here's the thing that that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it and risk does that make you met and data that does I mean that's almost ... percent I went to\nHarris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon of ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars and of course tax gets on there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents [laughter] and\nWhat they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives [laughter] remember these to cut through the cans with it and then to cut through a tomato I remember the guard against the knife out and they take a tape measure out and they measure one fourth of the ice cream and to cut it off a heart attack and then they put the dripping part\nThat's left the big three fourths into your bag and address over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent to what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd ... out of your money that you're trying to test out that's a really good at night they slice it and they slice of the money you put in land somebody because of their pocket some of them go and yours while and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThey are it liquid for the most part they are non traded really produce you've heard the phrase non traded read heaven here that\nI have yeah and probably when I met when I'm Talking about you for me you know yet what about you know yeah in that but\nIt's an entree that means if you buy it you can't sell it right or locked okay it's like when you buy silver and gold now but it's the silver and gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person you bought it from short last yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well I'm Glad we buy back\nFrom you for night [laughter] I might as much as I should say commissions both ways okay yeah so it would be\nVery careful if someone is peddling a real estate investment trust ask them why and say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many times with the fact that people know the where they want some real estate in their portfolio and if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow\nThat's what I was going to ask you know we we hear a lot of people who say advantage of the rental situation it was a ... is very different than okay\nSo we've got this cheat sheet that you can use to end its low gosh one two three four it's got six main topics in east each of those main topics has a sub topics ... forty eight\nDifferent sub topic wow and six main topics but then to be because you need to go through this before you buy something you'd never heard of ... like a real estate investment trust there you go yeah and one of the things that you have to say what what is that what are the strength and what are the weaknesses of that\nBecause many times when people come in and show us what they have all they've heard about the strikes\nA which is hopefully this will go up and that you could sell for a product of what we're doing that like in that sense yeah the maybe the hot so I said hopefully hopefully yeah\nYeah I'm going to get a quick bell but some people said you said maybe\nAnd put it in a place that had growth that future income that protection\nAnd now regardless of what happened to the stock market money\nThey had already purchased their income that we find with for the rest of retirement I Love it and therefore they gave him time to get the money that was exposed to risk that went down to not have to touch it so it could come back up well a lot of overlooked in financial planning will because most most planners tell you to a a will give me your money and I'll do better for you know over here in the war he says the paper ...\n... it's a real loss when people and I've seen people emotionally their their whole attitude towards life changes a hundred eighty degrees when the market's going down\nThere you go well I mean you say it's a pain and loss but then he tried to take that money and go vehicle with it I don't I don't think the dealerships gonna let you give a paper last money [laughter]\nI Know so stage one and when we talk about retirement income planning is ongoing it's always building and always thinking about what's your retirement is going to be and and looking at your tax planning looking at how much money you going to take out what what it's going to be taxable what the taxes could be and looking at what your Social Security when you when you take\nYeah and it stays to is well before retirement six to ten years out we start to tame down or risk or\nWe take some of the money out of the risk and we buy the income now that we want for the rest of our lives that will start when we need it like six or ten years down the road offshore and then we don't worry what happens in the market as much anymore [laughter] we always wore a right where I was ... and it didn't hurt it doesn't hurt to war you know safety pay attention during being proactive\nAnd knowing that things could go the wrong way\nAnd knowing that if it does you've already got your income secured and so you're not going to be very emotional when it comes to the money to still exposed to risk there you go to Amy down the risk of getting managed managed risk and doing that strategic we'll get your money\nMaking sure that you do the calculated risk exposure level on the money that's at risk so based on the risk you're taking how much could you go to the mark and with the wrong way\nAnd then how much in company needs to take some of that money out of the risk account let's get an income plan that will build our money where our money give us the income that we know what the income will be at a certain age in her life for the rest of our life and the rest of our spouse's life\nKnowing that if we pass away too soon that money will go on to our next again so it doesn't lose\nYou can't lose the money yeah sure it's easier for us that were there for somebody else and back in the old days if you if you've got a personal pension like that and you passed away the money was gone\nSo [laughter] but now the world has changed for the better for us if you get with a fiduciary plan or they'll put together a plan that makes sense to you that will give you that lifetime income it'll give you the growth of the market on one side it'll give you the income on the other side it's income planning and it's ... it's what changes there'd be a financial plan into\nA retirement plan it Cinderella is carriage that never turns into a pumpkin think about that there you go yeah you know that that's about twelve o'clock at night you know what to do a book and yeah and that will never turned a bumpy and if you do it right so you never worried about having to get home to see the uh step mom began\nThere you got what we always have you know we always hope for the best and I was talking to you or the other day in the hallway about this coach about uh we're putting some video content together I think for one of the videos that we do on financial ... dot com and I saw a video clips from a news outlet and it was done in like Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand and it was showing the projections of the stock market for the next Twenty years if you\nDon't know that oh eight is going to happen you don't know the oh and I want to get what they call the projections for early [laughter] just like Hillary was projected away let me ask you [laughter] don't let\nMe ask you this do you think a lot of people because you obviously me with folks on a daily basis you and the team upstairs right do you find that most people have these optimistic projections and when you actually run the numbers and they see what actually could happen there is a little bit of the blinds open\nYeah and one of the parts is and that's just one of the stages of retirement planning is looking at what you're going to have yeah the other phases especially when we get like a one year away from retirement especially we need to look at what are expensive they're going to be an retired OK yeah and so we make sure that our income is going to exceed or outcome\nOr I'll go through it and as we want more money coming in for me to talk about before when when you have a truly income plans set up inside your financial plan it turns into retirement plan but an income plan is when the mailman brings you money each year he puts that green flag on the mailbox\nAnd you walk out every every couple of weeks and put red flags on to send your bailed out so you want you want a bigger green flag than all the red flags that it together and therefore you have more income than than money going out and that's a successful retirement that's one that you have\nA peace of mind and you don't have all sorts and you're not worried about turned the TV running home to turn the TV honestly if your retirement a gal still there because of what the market and I believe it or not I know we laugh about it but but I Know a lot of people listening or looking at each other right now saying do we really have\nA retirement plan yeah yeah coach beat of course we establish one coach Pete regional ... says that if if financial plan is only a financial plan until you have income built into it now it is a true retirement plan and that income has to have to have growth\nIt has to have protection and it has to have income guarantees for the rest of your life that is a true\nIncome plan it's now these phony baloney plastic banana cut it reeks that we hear about silver and gold all these fly by night promissory notes only get rich quick schemes it's a real regulated retirement

straights quaint things all of the of the issue of\nThis is Michael madman here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage ... news reports say that the rates might be going down the costs that many Medicare plans are decreasing us here so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate housing markets offers that free service with access\nTo thousands of Medicare plant plans that can eliminate you're out of pocket costs plans with zero dollar premiums and then plant that pay you back\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind with so many new option it can be confusing you can get objected to help to find a plan and they caught flat and cover more with\nPlastic okay and the dash and see if you can feel the cable\nYou can feel the noise\nNow sometimes the the cable is sticky and the cable is a small round cable that's very flexible\nOn each end it has squares ... in the middle it's coiled up so hopefully that's a visual that and it could be two or three feet long but it's basically goes from the speed censor on your transmission all the way up to the back of your dashboard and many of the newer cars have electronic\nSpit on her so that doesn't apply but then the older cars certainly from probably I don't know Nineteen Ninety backwards and could be from two thousand a\nBackwards [laughter] so this phenomena cables making noise and it's also speed related so when you're going slow pitch and then when you're going faster it's different so are you disconnect the cable for in the back of the spin amateur and that's not easy that's something that's difficult to do\nAnd you have to know how to on latch it anyway\nSo you pull this phenomena cable down and you can pull the cables just straight up and almost always you'll find a couple of brown spots on this wire and cable\nAnd Denise brown spots are much bigger than the cable itself to and those are your troubled areas what is it it's just old Greece okay let's just told Greece so you take some carbs spray and you clean up those any dirt Danny imperfections on the cable\nThen when you're done you're sprayed with break spraying the carpet spray leaves a film\nBut break spray cleans the film up came so that's what and carp sprays a lot better cleaner than break clean is so you use those to products then you take some white lithium Greece and you put it in the center of the ... of the palm of your hand in your drag the cable through it\nAnd you just loop the cable then you slide it back in the house if you put it back on the back of this phenomena or if the noise is the same after you've done that then the head on this phenomena or spat came but about eighty percent maybe even higher than that when you lose the cable that will do it\nI Can't tell you when the last time we lose the cable at our shop I just don't remember the last time somebody came in with a noisy noisy us you know spin amateur cable came so it's not something that's real common nevertheless okay well\nHe had an older vehicle any had that\nProblem yes it appears that that's that's what the situation was okay so when we go in and we talk about car repair much of what we talk about has to do with\nSelf defense [laughter] what do you do when you're faced with something that makes you uncomfortable a lot of times folks will take their cars in and they'll say I have a clock when I stop\nAnd then the phone call back might be what your clock as your lower control arm bushes but in addition to that you're ... you have to monitor mounts that are broken and you're way past the poses and belts and along with that goes a lot fluids\nThat's kind of overwhelming yes it is you took it in for just nothing more than a clock\nAnd the clock has ballooned into two thousand dollars worth of repair yes so my advice and and especially to women and you can't really teach guys about car repair cars they all about what it what what what it's all about but for ladies the ladies answer is let's stick with the problem I have\nSo you write all that stuff down that I made but let's stick with the problem I have and let's fix it first I'm a little uncomfortable and all of a sudden it's ballooned to two or three thousand is or how much is the lower\nControl arm pushing that's bad or how much well if one's bad you need to do all four\n... and the and and then then the question is do I really need to do all four right\nAnd and as their savings in labor so can you do all four at substantially less labor and they just do one and there is no in this particular case there is no um opportunity for you to save labor when you pull the lower control arm off it just takes a second to replace want her to ...\nDoesn't take a second but for a short period of time for one versus two tier already ready you got all your equipment there you're punching out the ... the Bush and you're putting in a new Bush and what difference does it make the cost of the Bush and then the little bit of of time so if it takes a hundred and twenty five dollars to take a look and trauma off it's going to take\nTwenty dollars to do the first one I'm ten dollars to do the second one if everybody bills approach [noise]\nYeah so that's the kind of issue it is\nIn in so many words what you're saying is let's fix what I brought it in for and then if I can develop trust and you fix it like you said then you stand the last one I might reward you with some of the other stuff yes the second issue is is\nThe thing that drives me crazy as as I say to you Mrs sailing you need a transmission service and you say well let me look at the owner's manual to see if I'm In that ... mile or time range oh you don't need to worry about them stay on that monitors males not built for Arizona it's not written ...\nThis is that the response to that this is cut them off at the knees kind of response\nOh I'm Sorry they didn't give me an Arizona owner's manual would you order one for me [laughter] I guess there is no such animal they'll never get one and and then at that point you're going to get the person in front of you man or woman a service writer their step and all of a sudden they're dancing because they don't know what to say\nThat they're trained well an ending and all kinds of whether it's the chain stores the independent garages or the dealerships\nThey're trained to sell for and so the whole idea is to bring you in on the Nineteen Ninety five oil change but we need to have a three hundred dollar average ticket price now you and I both know we interviewed somebody not too long ago and he had been working at a quick loop facility\nNow this doesn't paying them all with one brushed but I Do know which one he was working at great so at least the one he said we bring them into the cheap oil change and we just had\nKind of a requirement by management to bring that pick it up to three hundred north to three hundred dollars\nAnd oil change still costs us more\nAh in cost than it does um managed to have five yeah at the end even even if you're in the semi synthetic se\nAnd you're thirty five or forty dollars the five courts have oil to filter plus the labor to do it plus the servers writers time to write up to work or plus parts time to ... it doesn't work laid off yeah we lose money right and so the whole idea is is how she can you go\nAnd if I'm at twenty nine Ninety five for a conventional and the guy down the street wants more business he's\nGonna go less than my twenty nine but he still has a responsibility to himself or to the shop to bring that ticket price up here we go we have ... ... good morning to you what can I Do for you\nMark thanks for taking my call you bet that was in five on the way in the ongoing okay and\nThat was coming to us to stop and I'm applying to break 'em right before I stopped probably five miles an hour to laugh it\nAppears like the pedal releases almost like the anti lock relief [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] well we're not go ahead you\nAren't in analog break time I'm anti lock only when when it's going down the road the abs computer watches the rotation of all four tires\nAnd if it sees one locks up than a dumpster pressure to that tire and then I generally apply pressure again it's almost seamless to the driver so what I hear you saying as you're coming in and just to the very end you feel something in the brake pedal\nOkay can you duplicate it every time yeah okay I I don't know what that is\nYeah I've never had a fading or anything it's\nMore of a ... he's talking about the ... movement in the panel yeah and I'm not quite sure how many miles or on your on boy\nI think it's got about a hundred and sixty thousand and um it's almost like it it doesn't really it's almost like it feels like it or leave\nFor a tiny bit not totally um yeah it's very noticeable and other people felt that all that one I use a heavy application on a lighter ...\nOkay I'm going to think out loud here ... have you had breaks on it in a hundred and sixty thousand miles\nYeah I mean I've only had it for about a year so I haven't changed mouth but they love of it is\nOkay and ... it I I was hoping for you and you don't know 'cause I Know you don't know 'cause you just bought it but um it it typically would have been through two sets of issues are three\nUm depending on who's driving it and stuff like that I'm thinking I'm Wondering if the rear breaks or an adjustment\nI'm Wondering if the rear breaks are releasing because they're real loose now he probably has four wheel disk and so there's a process to adjust the brakes on like the process we had when we had were drum where you've backed up and slammed on the brakes that helped adjusting\nSo on this breaks you can't here's what I Want you to try I don't know the answer to your question what part of the town do you live\nIn Phoenix okay on the east or west to central\nUh west central okay actually no I'm Sorry just about central I guess you'd say seven minutes after eight or twelve street and then they'll close by\nIt's not too bad okay Kelly Clarkson twelfth street in Glendale my advice to you um would go and talk to Jesse and say\nBut if it had to do with the four tires the bearing the drive shaft it would change dramatically when you've backed off the throttle\nAnd it would be there and and if it's a ... or anything to do with the four tires on the ground it would be there all the time\nSo it's difficult to to assign that but you know noises and vibrations are kind of tough to diagnose over the telephone ... is there any vibration related to this or not\nYou know okay okay I I I don't have a clue what part of town you live in\nA minute or tell us and ... ...\nOkay we'll eighty eight yeah well that's way far away from eighty eight unveil and may be way north um you could do to to as soon as tire which is on I tenant dice are\nAnd you could just say to them would you be ... I I can make this noise happened couldn't I borrow one of your technicians for ten or Fifteen minutes because if you take him out and you keep them for forty five minutes that really makes us owners mad\nBut if you can take them in that show the noise and then switch places with them and let him driving and make the noise then you're you're you're going to save yourself\nFifty dollars at least fifty dollars or maybe more in diagnostic time if you can pull that off\nAll right I'm Sorry I Wish I Hope you're better thank you very much Brad six oh two five await zero nine sixty six oh two five await zero nine sixty ... repairs I Seventeen and bell to give you an example and let's transition to Kurtz as far as you know what it is that ...\nThat he does he's the kind of guy that would handle that was no problem he's got he's a master tech Eric semester tech Jeff semester tech and those guys are hard\nYou can't draw to a better group of guys right but but test driving a car for a customer is is something we enjoy yeah we don't chase our tale that way\nThey called it this week when it's really rattled or and and the squeak denotes two pieces of metal rubbing together but at this is really a rattle and then you find out that the trouser broken and the shroud is rat leaving the fan hits it's an ... you know there's just a lot of things that can go on there so if you're up\nNear I Seventeen and bell than than Kurds auto repair northeast corner has been around since Nineteen eighty seven is ASC master certify technicians like I told you he's he's been around a long time and he's a good guy and\nI remember one time a lady had been bit three or four motors from two or three different shops and everybody said it needed a motor and I think he fixed it for less than a hundred dollars 'cause they had to do with an oil pressure switch that was showing zero oil pressure\nSo can you imagine putting four thousand dollar engine then and then really put me forty dollar oil pressure censor on knowing full well you're taken advantage of that person\nI'd make you sick and that's like ... I don't know this story was funny to me that we had a lady command last week and she said I'm\nIn my car fixed or whatever and and and he said well what's wrong with it and she said well I don't know or what what are you hearing or nine oh just have them Dr phil now\nAnd then he goes well like what are we looking for now just kept on guy that they'll figure it out and she said no we need some kind of direction what noise your hair and cause for us it might be different than what you hear\nThat happens a lot yeah that happens a lot it's it's an uncomfortable situation with respect to\nWe're not we we may fix the wrong choice right so ... it's ... you really have to drive it and say there's only ... I think that's what you have to do and we've picked the wrong noise many times and that's the ugly part of it is when you fix throwing noise you end up eating that repair or a couple of\nNoise so to five await zero nine sixty six oh two five away zero nine sixty the lines are open\n[noise] did you\nKnow rain tree auto repair is number one in the entire\nUnited States by Mercedes Benz for their hair's Andy vowed dad and his son Solomon palm operate rain three auto body in North got they've been around since Nineteen Seventy two kids and Honda Chevy than wars but they raided the best for their ability to correctly repair the Mercedes Benz remember\nRange Riyadh or Paris ranked number one in the entire United States by Mercedes Benz for repairs may have a machine called the select managed it the same gene the assembly you're far on range where you can put your cause absolutely free last condition with one hundred percent accuracy ... member with a plus rating rains Riyadh over\nBy hand those easy lifetime warranty on all the money when they use the ... than waterboarding\nWouldn't have no environmental aside\nFrom Asian style Bahrain tree auto body I Am the\nAlbum and I tell ya story yeah OK a long time ago when he became them far away as certain caveman named Donald stood up to a bunch of toxic swamp creatures and help his fellow have men take their government that\nIncredible and with my friend Kim ragweed we tell the stories based on a true story of this new movie have men who defeats the group a bipartisan cowardly swamp preachers it's called ... brains the swamp get your\nCopy of this book by accident him right wing today at Amazon Barnes and noble and wherever books are so\nAre you tired of exposing your retirement to stock market risk\nHow would you like to participate in stock market gains but never stock market losses\nJoined gains and Brandon herb is for that save money radio show here on K candy every Saturday at two PM in Sunday's at one PM and you can also called James and Brandon now for your free customize sake information money kit and a hundred and Fifteen page save money book at\nEight four four three seven one safe that eight four four three seven one Seventy two thirty three\nBack to the dump shut up next we have ...\n... who's a member of the shelter pet group that's right a coup known especially for their couch smuggling ball choosing faced looking back yard and of course companionship\nBrie ...
