P. dot com if you'd like to learn a little bit more and tell us if we are concerned that our\nRetirement plan might be nonexistent or lacking something of wines\nAnd we want to work with someone to help us on this what should we the who what quality should we be looking for what type of person should we try to work with to make sure we have a a more comprehensive plan that's more than ...\nAn investment strategy I Hope I've gotten across the point that\nThis is a net okay how you get to retirement how you you know what you focus on to get to read time and there's a lot different than what you need to focus on once you're close to retirement or certainly in retirement so you want to work with somebody who this is all they do all\nDay every day there's special is okay in retirement income planning\nThat's what they're not taking people who are twenty and thirty and forty and all different ages and in putting on different hats all day\nThat's the specialty but it's one thing to say it and it's another thing to actually be so if you sit down with somebody and that's their specialty retirement planning and they lead with the product\nGet up and run because you need a plan first you need somebody who listens to you understand what your goals are guides that\nOut if you like I said if someone sits down with you and and you say well yeah I Want to travel in time and they go oh okay good how much you want to spend again get up and leave because you need a little bit of digging from our experience like how do you travel why you want to travel how much do you want to travel so we can\nBuild that realistic goal your budget okay\nSo that's really important then and then again it's one thing to talk the talk it's another to walk the walk\nA part of the retirement planning a huge part of it\nIs tax plan and most people don't really see that during their working years because you know you got to pay your taxes on your paycheck right you don't have a lot of choices as to where you take your money from and how you pay your taxes in retirement you do how you handle when you take the money out to some degree what the tax classification\nOf that is there's a lot of choices if you have a well designed Lindsey you want to work with a special is someone who just doesn't say hey yeah I'm attack strategist now don't get me wrong we're not CPAs we don't prepare people's taxes we work with a team and we have the pie is on it who are great on that but we're the strategist behind\nThe scene and we've got a lot of education in that for one thing I'm ed slot you've heard me mentioned this before I'm a master elite IRA member of the ed slot group what that means is it's like I'm into he's the foremost already\nOn retirement tax planning for one k.'s IRAs rollovers distributions and retirement distributions upon death\nAnd you know what there's about sixty some odd thousand\nAdvisors in the United state wow there's about three hundred and thirty of us who are master lead IRA advisors wow we yeah I mean so it's an area of specialty I take great pride in it we have to meet twice a year\nIt it doesn't come cheap we ... we have semi annual tests to stay up on on what's going on with the Internal Revenue because it's a ever changing landscape and we have to log in monthly to see the update so you went to work with somebody who has that area of\nExpertise in tax plenty who their mentors you want to know that who are they learning from holiday keeping up with tax planning I say that that that's the red headed stepchild but you know if you make Fifteen Percent on your money or ten percent and you give back\nMore than your fair share it really doesn't matter how much you made it so much you keep and that's where tax planning comes into play so you want to ... in\nAll of these areas and they just don't say they are but they can show you what they're studying what they're learning on an ongoing basis you\nWant to make sure that that they've got a that they're independent that they're not\nJust insurance license or security has license or if they're both you want to make sure that they have a lot of different tools that they can bring to the table and not just one company these tools are really really important stuff so you want to make sure that they're just not transaction oriented\nWhere they charge you when they sell you a product but rather\nA their fiduciary who are required to do it to your best interests they have to disclose how they get\nPaid and you know they lay it all out soya transparency is really important so seduced carries a fiduciary standard that they hold themselves to is important you know one thing that we always do is we lay out and have somebody sign\nWhat we're getting paid whether whether it turns out that it's a commission product you know the clients not actually paying it out of their pocket per se we want people to no end to the side we bringing of value to warrant that so you want that transparency\nAnd you want a good relationship someone who hears you understand you and and wants to get to him through retirement with you not just throw some products you away and meet once a year and talk about how great it doing or how it's not doing and how you have to wait it out those are really important things so\nA great place to start to see if you're on track with a plan is come on and this is what we do all day every day\nPick up the phone at six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six\nAnd make sure that you're one of the first ten callers and you've had to save at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for retirement so that we can share some of our proprietary strategies with you get on our count there for that retire fit analysis of then you're in good shape we're going to let you know that wherever\nYou know it's it's a but it is fun isn't it a small world uh every now and I went to the hockey game of the other day with Marty Hensley who seven foot tall and of course everybody sees Marty up their heart demand he runs into people that know somebody he knows every single time I go out with him he he knows somebody that's no somebody else I mean it's crazy so\nMarty is not somebody want to Rob a bank with no 'cause I just wonder how they have to duck Taft high ceilings here in Studio ... end of the office and high doorways luckily so that wasn't planned because we built this long before we knew Marty so but I I wouldn't want to be a seven foot or who's always worried about\nBanging their heads and we know but you don't always ask me what the weather is up to the oh yeah yeah I was looking at a say stick it up as must be a thunderstorm [laughter]\nThat's a good lightning rod ever worried about getting it yourself All right so I wanted to talk about today because it's something very confusing a lot of people are having trouble with and then I see it every single day and I talked to the planet team and they see it and and people think everything's fine they've got all their money either many times have folks if you're listening you know there's two most all your money for retirement isn't your four\nOne K. it's in your for three baby you're ts be three savings way of your federal boy and you really have no control there I mean do you have these options they give you and many times you don't know why you're putting your money in certain places maybe a friend told you that it would have maybe that's what they were doing\nBut you don't really have a plan put together you have a big lump sum and I call that a lump sum time bomb was when the bomb in that's a friendly bomb is not that bad you didn't know was going to happen\nTo you know I didn't hit it's bad for me because I just lost water part because of a lightning\nStrike oh no that's right now but we don't want to confusion when it comes to retirement because when we get to retirement we need to have that money give us a lifetime income for the rest of our lives yeah all that money is in a lump sum so how do we take money out of our lump sum and know with certainty\nThat we're not going to run out of money and that's the dilemma that's a problem a lot of people have said what we usually recommend is something we call bucket balance All right so buckets of money so we need to take your money on that one big bucket and balance it amongst three buckets and\nEach bucket with its own purpose and you know balancing your buckets is very important and so simple and yeah but it's but you know 'cause we're looking at one big bucket and and if you ever have a big bucket of back in the day we have these gigantic ten gallon buckets we'd have to fill fill of water and bring in one place the other ... and her one summer and then\nForgot about him and just whatever reasons but never tried to carry a big bucket of water that's filled all the way the top what happens to let's fill out all over and it doesn't help you at all does it know and so every now and then maybe you'll lose balance in and they'll all tip over be gone\nAnd so we have our money in the market bucket and the market goes the wrong way Mm\nWe may just run into trouble and maybe we'll get overloaded has the market keeps going up like it does what are you going to do the money's going to continue to go up\nIf the market goes up but at the market goes down this is what people forget about what happens to your money then\nAnd how do we know with certainty that we're going to have a count that has growth\nProtection from the market protection from police protection from risk and also income\nFor the rest of our life so we go through later on the show and the next day when I'm going to start talking about the buckets but I wanted to just let people know there is a way\nEspecially if you have those lump sum those big lump sum and risky accounts there's ways to make sure that some of that money can stay in the market but other money the money that you're going to depend on is going to be there when you need it the most and that has all the way through retirement or anytime you need it we'd like to say you need it starts retirement planning\nTaking your financial plan turn into retirement plan by the time your age fifty two\nAnd if you're older than fifty two that's fine I'm fifty two now but I've been but I'm In this in this arena here I'm In ... in the financial industry so I've I've been planning for retirement all my life but most people are you're you're more worried about working and and I hey listen I Know that pursuing your passion takes effort and energy and leaving little time for building and managing your own wealth\nAnd that's why we're here folks

earlier on the show about the retirement ready to get we did it yes and make sure you retire when you're ready on your terms\nAnd ways to recession proof your retirement years now what does that mean to you when I say recession proof your retirement what does that mean to use the thirty two year old okay\nSo that makes me think that are in the long term when I Am ready to retire I don't have to worry if the market where to begin to thing yeah I'd have that confidence\nWell yeah because the recession and I remember my grandparents that this was back in the seventies nothing ever got thrown away food wise ... I mean by grandfather make chicken one day and the next day be chicken soup and like chicken something else suggested ... who knows like he would never waste the chicken as they would take the chicken bone or the turkey bone\nAnd put it in a stew pot and make turkey stewards you go yeah so it ended up making sure that everything that you have gets used the right way okay\nAnd unfortunately when we're paying fees that we don't need to pay ... you were in effect throwing that edible food away every single year yeah and if that food could have been put into better use or maybe you know get a lot more food with it so basically if you're paying the\nYou're losing the buying power for that money so we need to make sure number one rule of recession proof in your retirement\nIs make sure to have the reporter forensic the analysis to make sure you're not over paying on these that's right and\nAnd a lot of folks maybe like throwing food away they thought oh it's just garbage can do anything else with\nIt so you look at a statement and it doesn't look like you have many face right not the statement where the fees are really show many times when it's looking at the actual products and strategies are in and many times the fees are built in or they are in documents that you don't know how to read\nIt's incredible every time we talk about it I just don't understand how it will I really don't\nHave recession proofing retirement well it shouldn't be something called the produce Uri standard where the advisor is supposed to put your needs ahead of their needs that's right well I've been practicing that for twenty five years since I started very what a lot of people don't so I like to put myself in my listeners shoes and they are doing what they need\nAnd what would make me mad is would be paying fees that don't have to pay through that I don't know about truth right double play wrong thing I hear you and so when we look at we we want to be prepared\nNot surprising yeah every time it's all about ... you could retire early if you get your ducks in a row the right way we need to make sure that we don't over analyze things we get a good team planters on our side\nThat understand what your needs and desires are and custom designed\nThe plan that fits what you're looking for the very very important yeah we're going to talk about this and the next segment on real detail but nine ways to protect your nest egg huh okay or your nest egg is money you're saving for retirement so about a bird it sits in the nest and it's like sits on the egg and use it all nice and warm and to finally hatch is ... because it's growing right right\nWell you don't want it to be stolen or or crack before you before it ... and so what are because we want to make sure but\nSome of the topics here we need to talk about is and who else out there besides a million new\nIs worried about rising healthcare costs\nMm I imagine many of our listeners\nNow it's a big enough for when we have a paycheck coming in that's right and they get mad about how much comes in and that goes to al ... think about retirement when you don't have a a work paycheck coming in and you still have now let me ask you this to the health care costs go up or down when we get closer to or into retirement would've imagine they would begin going on here\nSo we are going to get into the way back machine\nWe're going to talk about the nine ways to protect your nest egg this is from a class that I taught back in two thousand and five\n... about the time the radio show started by the way wow and so that's a long time by the way time but it is does it seem like it though if you enjoy what you're doing exactly so we need to make sure we designed plants that we have a transfer made this conversation okay\nAnd that's an informal usually private discussion in which two or more people exchange thoughts feelings or ideas\nBy spoken word often causing someone's life to be better in some important way and that's right from Webster's Dictionary right so a transfer made his financial conversation is from my dictionary here and we're going to go through all those ways ... ways to protect your nest egg we're also going to talk about the twenty two steps now we're not do bite step\nWe do these all behind the scenes in three appointments but the total retirement plans\nAnd this is a way to retire with confidence many times retire early but when you retire you know everything's going to be like it should because there's no guessing\nAnd there's no might happen that's right like when you talk to some advisors or here's some other radio shows the guy say\nWell if everything goes right and and certain things do happen you have about a Ninety percent chance of everything being okay dangerous where it is what I don't like and I don't like all that stuff but the main thing that I Am for is a hundred percent chance of everything coming out right to strike so then it's not a chance anymore right on strike at the wheel of the chance to become a guarantee when it's a hundred percent\nExactly will end something you said as well coaches you want to prepare for retirement of success not one where you have to take you know ... percent of your income like a lot of people tried to shoot for\n... and again yes we ain't for a hundred and twenty percent of your working income in retirement not Seventy percent of what we call it retiring with success there you go not guessing and hoping for success exactly what I Love all these legal legal these things these days where people put disclaimer at the end where they try to make a\nAnd so you want to know because you're not in the financial but I Know 'cause I Know this person who's going to be able to share it I Know is it

[noise]\nA jury found Mr serving over there will be\nSorely serving a one year and one day prison sentence Mr wearable pleaded guilty\nLater this year according to the rest of the financial industry regulatory authority the panel found that this less than dynamic duo had to make James murdered a lot of the state of his late wife five hundred Ninety five thousand dollars in compensatory damages two hundred and fifty thousand and people that it\nMight be a bit since to Reno is in prison and lost his job is home and he's currently working as an overdrive to take away here as always know who you're dealing with cash plenty of plus she didn't make sure your broker disappeared this year\nFor the financial safari news network teams at all [noise]\nMean yeah the number two don't take advantage of I didn't move [laughter] I\nDid have a a a cool over driver once and he would he turns out he was a prison guard fulltime at bar were butter Isabel I wrote and he basically new Bernie Madoff sure already was a hero inside the prison because you know Bernie's a financial guide all they've got good hit for\nBut it never learn sometimes if you don't read the new train line [laughter]\nSo I mean do you have to be careful about these pumping dumps to right oh yeah Mm let's talk about a couple of where buckets I Want to make sure that the bucket of strategy folks as it's just a way it's not an end\nAll be all but it's a way for you to divide\nMentally to begin with but then physically hopefully your money into three different places one is for immediate emergencies we call that the yellow bucket nuts for emergencies or money you need within six to twelve months the next one we call we yell and read\nSo it could be mixed it could be our enjoy going to be read all the way it is your is your financial goals bucket or maybe your dream bucket and the timeframe for this book it should be at least one year that's the yellow part and could be two five ten or Twenty years that's the red barn day and I said I'll tell you why because basically anything that you're saving\nFor that can't pay out the normal cash flow in other words you have to have that money and then we used to one of your time rather because a lot of money goes tied to the market the political read they can go up and down so you want to leave that money alone\nBecause that's why we have in the bucket number one so if you need the money you don't want to take money out of your your red account your bucket to at the market is down 'cause you're walking in your losses so having those two accounts those two buckets yellow and the red one together makes sense but then\nYou say well gosh there's got to be a better way to save and not worry about the money long term\nAnd so that's a bucket number three which we called the green bucket and this is your retirement bucket and this is the most important bucket and it's one that a lot of people that are listening to it was like no we don't have a green but if we could all around the airport will tell you we've been told us our retirement yeah we don't have any safer options in there so I only not that that's a red bucket not agree bucket but there are ways of your fifty nine and older\nYou can roll out some of your money into four one K. and get into your own personal lives green bucket or if you left a job or two and you still have those for one case or give IRAs\nThese could be transferred into green buckets to your retirement bucket and any funds that you'll say specifically\nTo provide income when you retire but of course you need to be at least fifty nine and a half and the green bucket before you take money out because if you're under that yeah that ten percent federal penalty if it's an IRA\nAnd this money would fall into the green bucket and what what are the accounts we see a nice the green book at our traditional raw step simple I race for one case for three B. C. SPs they all our vehicles that could be in the green bucket\nRight again because think about it why do we save and all those accounts I just mentioned we said they were to have retirement but then we put the money into account where we could lose the money and so you know with Murphy's law which says Steve ... if it's going to happen it happens bad or whatever the brown down a law that well if you have all your money at risk\nAnd you're counting that money to be your retirement money and then when retirement comes a day you reach retirement gosh it's happened to be able to reach retirement the market decides to take a forty percent point what happened she retired but ouch now you're going to do forty percent less things probably sixty percent less things because now you're worried and retirement than he wanted to do\nYou're basically going to sit home and sit on the couch and watch Jerry Springer all day you know that's entertaining for me for one hour but I couldn't imagine doing that eight hours a day for seven days a week I lost about twenty minutes and so it's not as much as you can take so again that this is why we call it a bucket ballots you have to balance your buckets properly\nAnd no one's going to tell you about this if you're in the four one K. it's all when the risk bucket there is no say well the safe option gives you a one percent interest or something that's not safe that's losing money safely you need to be keeping up with inflation at least three percent growth every single year or you're losing money safely\nI Know what's at a bank gets into CD and you're all happy because you say it's safe but if each and every year we have inflation growing about three percent you're only already one percent you're buying power striking were having financial evaporation and we can't have\nIn a successful retirement plan that should last to be designed we designed our plans to last stage one hundred and Twenty one and beyond\nWe can go further but no I haven't seen anybody won Twenty one yet but plants will go forever and then when you pass away whatever's left goes on in your next again that's how the troop land is that the truth but it was your plan and it has all three buckets to read the green to get well buckets one two three balance your buckets folks balance your buckets if you're not sure about this\nCall right now we'll put together you're very young customized\nBus getting strategy that can give you that total confidence as you approach retirement folks keep in mind a proper bucking strategy has these three items and these three

not to do and you know we're not going to take the diesel exhaust food system off your car\nUm we're not going to touch that so that's a ... is that not the number one question or close to it yeah yeah we are a lot of that so um the D. F as a diesel exhaust fluid it's an emissions control devices and everybody believes that their ... their diesel will turn into a romp and stomp and\nFunny car if you take the ... the F system off of it and that's\nNot necessarily true you know what you're shaking your head for [laughter] it is true but we don't do it so I don't know\nOh okay [laughter]\nYou know your parents are both your jak though now Diaz never mind no neither one of them came yeah no I Know that's what I mean that's a yeah we\n... yeah because that's the last year that they didn't have the right areas are both emission compliant yes yes [laughter]\nThey're really quite yeah yes\nBoth of ours are mission work a registered yeah yeah yeah I Know their minds at the ranch almost all the time they have what six days a week yeah yeah ... week so whatever you know\nGet your mind up on your lips is fine you know I'm looking at the scale and it's not fine I'm telling you sign airline angry they didn't want to eat it all doesn't want his ears were even though [laughter]\nHave\nLight anyway All right out of dynamics in Sun City is the largest and most trusted shop there it's family owned and operated since Nineteen eighty to ... started it now Derek his son is running it\nAnd there's been a significant difference in quality between Derek and his dad Chuck of course I've known Chuck since Nineteen sixty eight so I can say that but that's not true and you know at\nAn automotive dynamics they have staff have technicians\nAnd dairy trying something that's kind of knew in our industry\nHis his staff his service writers are mechanics are not paid it a commission or a percentage of your repair real so therefore there's no motivation to sell you on necessary parts or repairs so if you're looking for a great shopping center city I recommend automotive dynamics on the north side of grand avenue just west of Ninety nice to have a new\nSix oh two five awaiting zero nine sixty if you have a question of problems six of sci fi but wait zero nine sixty and we've got the air gun running which means somebody on the ... area yeah we can you know what kind of serious and leave [laughter]\nIt sounded like it would be oh\nThis is going to be a bad deal\nAnd you know like oh my lord [laughter]\nListen\nListen we used to have the doorbell that you know but yeah people complain because their dogs with darker yeah so you know when I came up with the gun not guilty ... just needed to turn it up a little bit more guilt just give us a string\nOf cash but All right we're going to need it back and we got that name already gill who who's sitting on the line with mall all good morning to you none of us have been around here\nUm I watched that at all I K ... on my team you know a lot of needy\nWouldn't let me get\nA little light on\nOkay [noise] well the engine code doesn't tell you how to fix the car the engine code tells you where the problems that and so let me give you an example\nYour emissions code says the problem is in Ohio and we have to go to Ohio and find out what city what street and then what address\nSo um it you know Paul you can get on the Internet there's all kinds of people that will help you with your problem but most of those people don't know their butts from a hole in the ground and wonder with respect and car repair and you're going to spend your money having some Bozo in Texas tell you how to fix your car\nSo it's not a good idea to to do a popular\nOr you know vote to get on the Internet right and then you can go to YouTube university and they'll help you out as well here's what you need to do and this is what happens if you take your car into the shop the diagnostic charge will be a whole lot less than gas and from now until the time you know your birth date comes around\nSo they're going to go in and look at what we call cereals stream data it's what's going on now the kid at at the auto parts store doesn't have this eight thousand dollar piece of equipment or ten thousand dollar piece of equipment so we're going to watch what's going on\nIf the event so annoyed comes on but then the gas tank doesn't tell the computer that sees a vacuum\nThan the problem is either the vents so annoyed not coming on board the vent sensor and the tank is not seeing the vacuum or there is no vacuum so then we go in and determine what's going on because see we want to suck the fumes off your tank\nAnd we want to burn them again but that's the only one of maybe four or five systems the tax code has to do with\nSo like I said you can replace that the dumps zone argued and place the vacuum censor you can replace lots of parts but the diagnostics going to be cheaper\nThen you try and the gas but certainly it's up to you\nUncle shot on the Web and let them\nUm are you anywhere near thirty eighth avenue in in in school\nA lot of okay well uh Larry ... auto is owned and operated by Ellen and her husband Bob and Bob runs the shop and elements who you meet at the front counter and there's no question in my mind Bob is one of the best diagnostic ... I've ever met\nHe might even be better than me\nSo I think you should go there and bring your telling what code you've got he's going to say we're going to spend ... ... you know like at my shop we say Seventy five to one fifty and we'll call you but we've been able to diagnose well into that into that range and then they'll call you with the repair so you have three parts of the bill\nThe diagnostic on the part and then the repair now here's the good news\nSometimes it's eighty two dollars and fifty cents defined it and two dollars to fix it\nDon't count on that but that happens sometimes\nOn the wall\n[laughter] okay are they ... out of their own in school\nAs Larry Harper's auto\nAnd in in any of that\nIt's thirty eighth avenue and the Indian school three eight avenue in Indian school\nA likely already All right\nGood luck to you Paul good luck to you that uh we get a lot of that don't like him even when they come in and and and and what\nDid they say to you I let me guess it's got this code and I've replaced this this and this and this and the yeah yeah inevitably yeah must that times now what percentage of the time you to do we actually it costs you eighty three dollars and fifty cents or something like that and then they just plug it in a vacuum line that's come off on the truck or whatever it is very rated\nOr something exactly I I I don't know that I could put a percentage on it maybe maybe thirty percent okay I'm like that where it's a cheap cheap easy fix the other day we have them come in with the miss fire that the call was unplugged for whatever reason as coming flipped on the object or the uh\nUh the the can actually they're going to the index are going to ... can't remember it was it just was a snap all the way and so I mean stuff like that\nYeah and we've gotten him or they have multiple like e that codes and you know we've found the gas cap list that we start there clearly ... town to drive it bring it back like comes back on and kind of due process of elimination\nSo unfair to see what I mean uh\nYou got codes I don't want to say a lot of times with some of the times our gas cap yeah it's not a bad twelve dollar gas in that situation in that situation but but that one the that's usually small leave athlete\nI I Am who\nI Know I I Know you've had the battery tested but you know you've ... you've got an a starter so annoyed and you've had the battery of tests that with the exception of of one and a million ... ignition key or neutral safety switch I mean those are really far out\nThere I had a two week old batteries the other day or go back\nThe young lady had had to replace elsewhere and uh and it has on it was two weeks it couldn't be the battery well it was the battery and you know so it's not out of the realm of possibility\nYeah and then it's the sophistication of the level of equipment to if you eat and you also you test the battery typically with the cables off of it\nSo you're ... both cables off of it you lose all your priest sets your radio presents and all that jazz but you usually we test the battery all by itself\nSo we don't want any draws on it or anything like that and and a lot of times the equipment that they have an auto parts store is Fred Flintstone equipment that was a you know something we used in the sixties and seventies and the eight here it's not necessarily something that we would use today but obviously the equipment we use today is far more expensive\nThe equipment we use today too is they're sick cells and a battery and every once in a while we'll get a single cell that goes bad so every six to time or seven time or fifth time it won't start ours has the ability to go in and kind of each individual one so they don't have that they just kind of an overall surface charge on it um\nAnd then that one cell will do great the other ... sits there so sometimes you say hey starts up just fine but if I let it sit there three days it doesn't start well then are the tests that we and other shops are offering you would be able to pick that up two minutes so\nWe\nTurn on a cable are\nOkay you it's their problem now you've you've paid for the diagnostic the guest on this started clearly that was a guest on the battery clearly that's not a guest on the positive cable and clearly that's not it\nSo I'm ... I'm going to that effect you twenty eight will help you just write on them\nAnd and if I understand voltage ... and then last but not least ... you remember that one guy that had an intermittent start and we hooked up a series of lights and we had three lights on the first one said that the battery was okay the second one said the sonar has energized and\nThe third one said the starters energized so whatever we didn't have we knew that was a problem we hit the key and all three flights would work and so that means we have power going all the way to the starter ... what happened was there is a solid annoyed was effective if you got down there and topped with a hammer it would start every time\nBut if you didn't have it with a hammer and only start once or twice out of five times so sometimes we just got to gay customer a hammer and say tap gently disown order the starter now if your wife\nIs is with you have her sit in the driver's seat and hold the thing to the star position you get out with a hammer tap gently they saw annoyed and then a little harder on the starter and if a pops and rise than the ...\nOkay All right thank you good luck to you and thank you very much six
