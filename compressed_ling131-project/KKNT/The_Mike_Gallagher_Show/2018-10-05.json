Virginia has voted yes so\nHe joins Jeff Flake Susan Collins as yes votes Murkowski is and know that could play out that way where these key votes\nFlake pollens Murkowski and mentioned three as

the video courtesy of Fox News and gray being as they are holding the role and holding this crucial vote on the cabinet nomination for the United States Supreme court\nHis colon\nCancer can\nThis court has now so [noise]\nRight so you're a little bit of history being made and you hear in the eyes and you're hearing the nays are their nose and uh I don't want to kind of dragged out for you because uh what what matters is what they're going to do and we're reporting there too humid here other yes as Jeff Flake is yes this is a cloture vote part one\nThe second part would be tomorrow for the full Senate vote on the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh flake as he asked Collins is the gas and mansion here's a yes which is a big surprise today are\nWell again I I'm ... and I was speculating do shows how good I Am with predictions that Heidi Heidi Heitkamp\nCould be a no I mean yes rather because of Heidi Heitkamp votes no she's going to lose her Senate seat in North Dakota she did announce yesterday that she's a no vote which means she's absolutely going to be the former senator from North Dakota she's out\nUm but there you go three of the four key senators voting yes let's get your reaction to all of this one eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four or five three great to have you here in the relief factor dot com studios as we are uh watching history unfold right before our very eyes Terry Europe Jared welcome aboard what do you think\nLike Jersey at night I take it a little more of a historical but you know to this shortcoming to compare this situation to the civil war thank God the only difference or not killing anybody yet\nNot yet why don't you want to get one of them tried on a baseball field in Virginia with member\nYes absolutely but the reality is that every public Republicans need to understand when you have power and you don't you learn and they were very well what if they don't you\nKnow this this idea of a civil war is very real to millions and millions of Americans and that's fair um I've talked about this for years and I remember being on the stage of ... a few months ago with a colleague who sort of rolled his eyes of the at the idea that we are in a\nCultural war we learn a war we're in a war for our nation so we're we're in we're in a battle over what how we want our country\nTo be what we want represented in this country what what are what our standards our values our laws are going to be a very big presumption here of guilt ... until you can prove your innocence we have turned American\nUm standards and values and mores honest here by the by the activism or the left\nAnd it's frightening you know and and I I'm so I was reading about the Ellen DeGeneres announcing this week but she was a sexual assault survivor\nAnd you know that breaks my heart I think she I think she was a ... if I saw it correctly she was Fifteen and that's horrifying that that helped define and shape\nHer that trauma that Robin of innocence and and everybody is pathetic and and an agonizing over such a horrible crime against an innocent defenseless child\nAnd we have had a real bust conversation about women in the workplace\nBeing being abused and and treated terribly by powerful men\nBut then there's me to thing has extended into the cabinet process where allegations have been made from high school and early college that haven't been able to be cooperating\nAnd in this conversation about cabinet I keep hearing the left used that term you get to speak my truth this is my troops\nAnd honestly at last I'd love to find a caller who can help maybe somebody on the left and I don't mind I Would love to hear from you actually to explain to me what night truth means\nBecause my truth may not be the truth and it seems very clear to me\nBut the pursuit should be but the truth\nAnd I I don't really understand if we can clear align Lance and see if we can get a caller who can help explain to me what it means when when when some of these um advocates and activists and voices say that Christine Blasey Ford gets to tell\nThe truth truth this is my truth this is her truth or his troops will ... is that is that kind of a shuttle acknowledgement\nThat it may not be the truth what if Christine Blasey Ford believes with all of her heart Brett Kavanaugh it but he didn't so I'm just going through a hypothetical process\nWhat if what if it was another boy\nWhat if it was a memories that she has wrong in the way she is recounting this some thirty six years later does that mean you can you can defend that truth that isn't the troops in other words it does hurt truth supersede\nThe truth I think about this as it applies to Brett Kavanaugh if that's the case\nThen a false fluids stands a man has ruined a family is destroyed and reputation is shattered because truth isn't the truth hypothetically Tim says she can explain it to me how you doing Tim welcome to the Mike Gallagher show\nThank you uh it it comes from the education system and a lot to be behind that education system and they operate on the philosophical axiom that perception is reality\nSo you have your perception of what happened is your reality which you and I know it's not true right as if somebody believes pillow\nBurden for seems a pillow as wrong ticket and after Iraq you had a they quickly learned that perception is not ...\nThat's an interesting way of looking at it so that's done but maybe you're right maybe the belief is your perception is reality therefore that stand and frankly to most Americans that's wrong that's not a normal\nLogical understandable process breaking\nNow on the Mike Gallagher show All right the Senate has voted fifty one to forty nine to advance the cabin on nomination there was a fifty one to forty nine vote and a shockingly to some Lisa Murkowski voted no\nIt was believed that Lisa Murkowski\nCould be this was again considered one of the big swing votes one of the undecideds she voted no which of course signal she's going to be a no vote tomorrow in the fall confirmation process however senators flake Collins and mansion Joe mansion from West Virginia\nCame through and voted yes so you've got fifty one to forty nine votes if you were to lose some how in the next twenty four hours\nAny of those three flake Collins or mentioned say one say last one of them let's say I don't know Susan Collins decides to join Lisa Murkowski and do they know\nYou still have ... the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh because Mike Pence has the president of the set of breaks that breaks the tie he cast the deciding vote and uh you would win by one on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh Michelle is reacting to Lisa Murkowski's vote how you doing the show\n'cause what can we actually turn your radio down for me five before the hour here again fifty one to forty nine the cloture vote go ahead Michele\nPilots ... like Herman as as you know I I left a message on a cell phone for about ... and I um I haven't been out there that I just find it interesting that ... all these helicopters they're sexually\nYou have questions let us be the answer nine sixty the patriots\n[noise] my\nFriend is a friday [noise] the well known that friday the entire world of literature surrounding friday [noise] welcome\nIndeed every body and there was a ... vote in the U.S Senate do they in other words\nTo vote to put the vote on the justice for a vote [noise] you\nCannot closed debate and cloture it's cold\nAnd\nYou cannot extrapolate necessarily from a ... vote to how they will vote in actuality so you can vote for cloture and then vote against\nBrett Kavanaugh so it is not a given at all in my mind that he will\nBe\nNominated by a spy or chosen ratified ... confirmed by the U.S set of is not a given I heard and I have to verify heard is that a Republican senator from Montana will be attending his daughter's wedding is walking down the aisle on Saturday\nSo that would deprive the Republicans up another vote\nAlready Lisa Murkowski she even voted against cloture now it's theoretically possible she would vote for Kavanaugh having voted for cloture but it's unlikely\n\nI just my heart breaks for the man and I don't know what else I can tell you\nI have made in my case from the beginning that it did not deserve the U.S Senate hearing you cannot make a high school accusation that has never been made against any one Republican or Democrat with zero corroboration\nAnd have the United States Senate close its functions and an entertainment\nYour charge\nIt just it wouldn't be done with anything else\nYou know we uh we we saw him in gay I saw him engage in an armed robbery and high school I think they would have stopped the U.S Senate for that hearing\nA fully credible person I saw Brett Kavanaugh engaged in an armed robbery armed robbery when he was a junior in high school\nAnd guess what I can mainly the people who uh who saw him do it and then every one of them says I don't know what the person's talking about including one of them who is a best friend of the person making the accusation\nSo why is why did the white as the U.S government shutdown why does the U.S population preoccupied with one charge from one woman from high school thirty five years ago why and we all know why\nBecause we live in the age as stated by\nA professor Alan Dershowitz at Harvard law school a lifelong liberal Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism that is why\n\nI I don't [noise] and he said it's darker rich a darker period than that and this is a liberal Democrat but one of the only ... only the only liberals with courage liberals are not leftist but they are but they are very weak\n... except the case and the rare case of an Alan Dershowitz who has told me personally and on film to me you will see it in my movie without um curl up no safe spaces next year\nIt said to me that he is far more afraid of the left than of the right\nHe well listen to it and see he was all it took her ... she was like\nThis is the this is the sexual McCarthyism right I mean think of it ladies and gentlemen I Wonder if somebody had said he committed the murder in high school whether they would have been a hearing I doubt it you have any cooperation\nYou have a dead body\nYou have witnesses no and no on all counts I'm Sorry\nMurder is the worst thing that a person can engage in nevertheless we can't stop the engines of government of the United states of America because one person makes warm I'm corroborated charge murder\nTell me where by analogy is by analogy ... an improper\nCoal may tell tell me you are listening tell me why this happened\nOn what grounds were the hearings held to this is what I this is what I said from the beginning I was attacked by conservatives in the Washington Post National Review and elsewhere and I maintain my original\nPosition was correct all these conservatives do\nUh is feed the beast yes look what you can do to ruin a man's reputation man who hundreds of women\nOf all backgrounds in of all political persuasion Z have affirmed is such a decent man\nI I'm not sure that I have witnessed something like this in my lifetime and we've had this performance Clarence Thomas Clarence Thomas ... who is still used as a poster boy for sexual harassment at worst tea is accused of talking\nA mentioning sexual matters in a conversation\nA with a a wasn't a would be ...\n\nUh I I happen for the record I happen to think that it's unwise to do I have not done that and I'm not a proponent of it I but I think it needs to be put in perspective\n\nI mean this is is it the statement of a woman cannot even here talk about sexual matters\nIt is so it is so devastating it is I don't think is a is affirmative a female straight\nI don't defend it but I I'm Talking about how\nHow awful is it in the perspective of the awfulness of the people are capable of problem is in the United states of America things are so good for so many people that they are they exaggerated view\nSin takes place I don't mean religious and secular so\n\nWhat we are this is what we have witnessed though the closing down of the machine machinery of government they were willing to go to California\nThe entire Senate Judiciary committee or you were that was their argument will come to you when she said she was afraid of flying they made an offer of going through her\nWhole maybe our representatives of the committee or not the whole coming on super important to have some accuracy on this program but the one who how whatever the number\nThey were willing to go to her and it is because we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism trust as Alan Dershowitz ... that's the issue\nBut I I don't think in real McCarthyism in the actual you were in the Nineteen fifties I don't I don't know I simply don't know I I ... if one person had said\nAbout a Supreme Court nominee I Know he's he's pro communist that's after all what because he is charged with unfairly characterizing decent people's communist just like we have on fair charging of of people have sexual predators\nYou remember any left wing sites called him a serial rapists do magic can be I mean the demand that man must wake up and say God how did how did this happen\n\nWhile they Prager Chevron Sherman six eight seven seven to for three\nOr triple seven six\nWhat if this is my question to you and you should posed this too if if if a anti Kevin relatives or even willing to talk the remember they are over mention\nAll of these things are happening as a result of the tax cuts the regulation overall optimism about the teacher\nAnd the only thing that we need to do now it's gotten a little weird but ah that caused the house voted on tax cuts to Plano last friday and now it's headed the fence and that will make the tax cuts permanent for small business and individual because right

I'm In November and if there's going to be at the choice or Americans they're going to choose between the continued pro growth job a policy that the next generation or they can choose to see them all back in a tax cut 'em go away and then creep again\nYeah there's a lot at stake\nAlright listen I uh I salute you I think you're tourists magnificent your website is\nCuts work dot com my friends I've been speaking to wheeling Parker Elaine speak to you soon I think you know there's so many people doing good work it's it's ... it's got to give you\nStrength because when the media saturate the country with one message it's it's it's easy to get despondency it's easy to think everybody thinks that way but it's not true\nSo please just go just go there that's a tax cuts work dot com\nBoom of folks who run this terrific people why one ape Prager seven seven six\nAnd let's see here Tony in Cleveland Hi\nTony\nHi that you are you okay thank you\n... ... an honor with that and I love it so I Apologize up front you know so people you know his great you know who would you like sit down a discussion where you'd probably be like a number two [noise] who's number one [noise]\nI haven't [laughter]\nYou have a lot for having to walk around that's great I don't know who you just reserving the spot I'd stay stay on with the president is back in a moment\nAnd then a Springer show the releasing freeze to be [noise] you're listening you until the phone nine sixty\nNine sixteen now citizens soldiers' boots on the Supreme Court ...
