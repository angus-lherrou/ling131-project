career and I've made decisions that people are said why did you do that and it turned out to be a pretty good move for me but you know at the time people will say oh my gosh you're resigning from WABC radio in New York and yeah I took a chance to run into syndication and it worked out but you know you're Twenty years later pretty good\nI mean if the people make decisions based on things like the the the brutal treatment you get when you're in that fish bowl and so I I really do get it um and maybe that's what this is it must be something do\nSebastian if if if the two of them are making a

perfectly Times Book\nThan your book why we fight defeating America's enemies no apologies because let's be very blunt here sometimes America's enemies are from within and what we owe it and just over the last few weeks I I Know you you had to be as disgusted as the rest of us\nAre totally because I Lived in I've been through it will be accusations made against me and the White House and you know we had we had a saying in the west wing when all this stuff was going on you only take flack when you wrote the targets but this was disgusting and the interesting thing\nAbout my ... fine which of course I wrote long before\n... was was nominated rice is there's a chapter in there by the great American here so the book is about all the threats America faces and what the president's going to do about them but then I have these personal stories about four amazing American heroes and the last one is a guy called\n... chambers that most Americans and probably Ninety five percent of millennials have never heard of but we did the same boat as most of the Capitol before ... was born so just just a little sound bite\nThis is the man who stood up for the shoes in the first televised congressional testimony ever in Nineteen forty eight right he stood up to say I was a former communist and I can tell you the comment is our and by the government and what happened to him\nThe left went crazy they accused him of having an affair they accused him of being a closet homosexual they used to being responsible for the problem is that all of my one of the line than it used to live on\nThe end of the day he won because he stood up for the truth so anybody who says that he was just going by the treatment jobs ... received a guess what the Democrats have been doing it for about seven years mind\nAnd and it's gotten so bad that it's almost as a fever pitch and frankly I'm hoping and praying that Americans remember\nWhat has happened over the last month come November the six because you know there and they are on record you know it and we've seen them promising left and right impeaching Kavanaugh house members threatening and promising an investigation of Brett Kavanaugh they don't want this thing to end\nAnd if they get control the house in the Senate We're going to be we're in for a world of hurt\nWe look I've chosen the title of the book for a reason why we fight

we have to go even further one son though I mean let's let's remind ourselves who's James Hodgkinson mind I mean this is a name that shouldn't be done in the brain of all Americans James ...\nWell

had a funny feeling it by Nikki Haley a and I know what it is I Know it was all of her criticism of Donald Trump when he ran for president 'cause I don't forget that\nAnd I don't mean to like ... keeping score or I'm not I don't have an enemies list I've got friends who uh who who lashed out against the president um obviously she accepted a key position within the administration as UN ambassador\nAnd ah she has not she's backed off of all of her negative comments about the president when he was running but it's just hard for me to hear people who even\nPortend support for um for the president um you know and and and not ... not forget and always have a hard time not forgetting that so we're going to save\nPortions of our Schober actually by the one and only my pillow Michael

my friends I [noise] I watch\nActually I listen to Nikki Haley's conference with the president [noise] where it was announced that she was leaving the United nations at the end of the year she had already told the president is [noise]\nPrior to the I don't know when the ... was it made clear several months ago already so there's speculation as to why is she leaving because of course nothing could actually happen for a literally innocuous reasons\nSeems to me that two years of the United nations or one should be up for a monument somewhere in the capital\nEspecially if you've confronted the bad guys of the world is Nikki Haley has and I wasn't done by during the eight years abroad Cole bomber\nAnd keep being true to a major left wing\nAttitude toward life you\nWhen you don't fight this is an ancient to tell you to phrase those who are cruel to the kind of oil better for those who were coming to the crew will be cruel to the kind\nThat is a motto of our dear fellow citizens of the left ... liberals but boy left\nAnd that is that they are kind to the cruel like the Iranian regime and they are cruel to the kind like Israel that's a perfect pitch truly a perfect example there was something truly sick\nThere's a there's a morality of the conscience for those who were kinder to Iran to Israel or to Hezbollah or Hamas or to all of them\nNikki Haley has been extraordinary if the United nations Donald Trump has been extraordinary that the United nations\nAfter all the United nations ambassador reflect the will of the president of the United states I repeat that the risk of\nWhat is the risk but I think of it through what is the risk in my sings at the bus far the president of the United states has been a great president\nMm well the risk is\nThat you alienate those who have the president but I have a model would regard Tibet\nI adopted this when I ... in my first full time job\nAnd I was ... the director of a Jewish Institute in California that's why I moved from New York to California in my twenties to direct this Institute they had weekend retreats which gorgeous facility thirty two hundred acres and\nThey had this summer sessions for young people and I would advocate gobs existence and I would advocate observance of the laws in the Bible and so on\nAnd some members of the board or very afraid of my advocacy of\nGod's existence set observance of the laws of the Bible and so on and they uh they would say to me you know not not not with hatred or anything like that are just they would be worried and they would say you know you'll alienate some of the people who come and I developed a great phrase\nThat has guided me can't alienate the alienated they already worry alienated [laughter]\nThat's why they showed up [laughter]\nSomebody you don't want friends beg them to cover his buddy treated them through a weekend or whatever\nSo you know I'll alienates people by saying that the president of the United states has been great develops far I don't think that those people have already not been alienated because that's all it takes is is a favorable word of a mirror vote for Republican\nAnd you're pro rape you understand how ... does become there are no limits to what the left will say that there are no moral limits to what they will do or\nSay who is this person who tweeted out that the take a hit you know do something for the good guys and that somebody should take out Brett Kavanaugh\nTeacher yeah it was a teacher with\nA special ed teacher in Minnesota and and so this is one cracks me up a ... so was this on a Facebook account or a tweet so Twitter has decided to suspend this person's account suspend\nYou would have publicly cold for murder and your your account as suspended didn't they suspend James was too cold for no no violence whatsoever who's barely won by the way he is truly\nOne of the ... people in the country you are I I don't read many tweets but I ... I read his my wife's ... chokes them to me\nIt's a it's an extraordinary thing so anyway ah he has been great it is an astonishing thing I Do worry I admit it or would like to let me come on every Wall Street journal hear ya I admit it\nI'm just saying I worry less do you think that because I support the president I have a bans in critical fought and I may be wrong for either way I was just telling you I'm worried I'm not telling you I oppose what he's doing\nBut I Am worried U.S China strains deep and and I there was only one reason one\nThat I Am worried about us China relations you know what am I the title I don't think the Chinese would invade Taiwan\nMetal Taiwan so good because North Korea\nI think that if China says to Kim Jong un don't continue the nuclear ... of them he won't he's too reliant on China\nI stretched China's way of holding us hostage is is North Korea there is no no no other\nSo that's the reason I worry about that that China has abused the world Trade Organization that it is abused intellectual property it's I I personally a worry more about China's about Russia\nFor a whole host of reasons I and I think the Chinese nationalism is growing\n... China I Know a fair amount about China because of my involvement with the Chinese people and ... ... people don't know how corrupt China is that corruption is a way of life in China\nFrom inside I Know for example people often pay for pay for judges they not only pay the judge they pay to get the judge and the and kept the verdict that they want\nIt's a ... it it it's a truly in many ways I mean\nNot all Chinese I mean Chinese come to the United states for example they become spectacularly successful by a\nSurgeon is what is what such example of who is considered somewhat of a genius and my by recent or injury of my eye which by the way it's getting better and better thanks to the treatment that I have been receiving the chief\nThe person involved in my I work including lasers surgeries also of parents are Chinese\nYou don't have to show me on the capabilities of Chinese people but ...\nIs devoid of values because of many reasons the biggest of course being the communism communism rapes a country of its values it empties better than rapes it empties a country of its values\nNothing there's nothing left after communism it leaves a gigantic coal now Christians are feeling it somewhat but the persecution of Christians in China has increased all of this is to tell you\nI Am I Am mystified that wonderful people notice never Trump hers did not understand that\nI don't get it they don't get me I have a dentist Prager is devoted his life to more for them to to character issues and and he supports this president we are in a big fat ugly bubble\nThat was apropos what\nDid they say they are we right so that's why I didn't understand it he's speaking who's speaking about if it's we know so I don't know that's the point that the reason I didn't quite follow\nAll right and but he lives with me\nThis is the cover story taking up a good chunk of USA Today today one aide Prager seven seven six is the number\nAnd let's hear has read in Minneapolis, Minnesota hello\nI watched the a press conference for president had with Nikki Haley about her resigning and I thought it was a very positive uplifting informative yes and almost immediately Senator Bob Menendez a Democrat New Jersey\nA wrote that today's announcement that ambassador Haley is resigning if you had another sign of the Trump administration's\nChaotic foreign policy and he went on to say deeply concerned about a leadership vacuum that she was leaving\n... Noda after that you know to read that the the left has always deeply concerned they live in a state of deep concern\nI just they always use that word so why does he he's deeply concerned that what I mean I was talking over you at the end\nI was just wondering if he was watching the same press conferences I\nOh I see yeah\n[laughter] but I I thought it was a very uplifting frantic faced they both look very pleasant wrapping they have ... I was expecting something maybe a little ... but uh I thought oh this is a you know she's moving on that she's done a great job and\nShe's a big fan of the president wants to continue to stay in touch
