probably know the doctor and it gives us a nationally recognized authority on both natural and alternative health he's also a very successful chiropractor he's been son out by top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns so Dr biggest what is this how secrets that you've been talking about\nWell what the secret is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C.\nVitamin C. All right well uh vitamin C is is not really new though no vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell and unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends\nIn the bottom line is with out enough item and see and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies diabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be short and by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nIt's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contained to sixty five milligrams of vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three or four thousand a year and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice\nSo because of lack of vitamin C. they were getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well\nThe number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just don't any energy I don't feel like myself\nI'm hurting yeah and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we got to do these tasks send you through the scanner and the problem is is they don't find anything ... it's the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd it was interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. All right and the other ones that aren't any pigs primates and the fruit that\nWhen you look at the rest of the animals out there you don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure you don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C\nHuh and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat Yeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy there first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it yeah right but you know I think most people myself included thinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu\nSo we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were\nSuffering from is that you know what it is actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my supersede twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you\nDrink it down if you have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right amount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. oh that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... is your body needs different forms of it and I put it all into one vitamin formula\nNow and you said that was how much vitamin C. and your supersede twenty two years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're going to experience this energy vitamins the producers energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it and\nToday right that's right I'm going to include an extra free supply of my super the formula one you place your

it's one eight hundred to zero eight one nine six zero well what do you think folks this is pretty interesting isn't it\nDr ... so it's been really talking to us about vitamin C. and I'm like most of you I was more under the impression the vitamin C. was instrumental in helping to boost your immune system\nThen all of these other things that we've been talking about a including being able to extend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show\nThat there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I didn't go to the supermarket before I got here [laughter]\nOkay and I brought some vitamin C. and I I went and bought these and I'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in it so\nIt right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C. that in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well just one type of score but gas to write this so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... they'll sell us has grown up newspaper\nOr the next one is uh vegetables Derek Ghassan now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form of\nA and the next one is a sort of like a silica sand sand like the beach\nSorry so here's another one tried to throw in here OK so one of the national ... right right so this was five hundred milligrams okay this is a true all yes All right so take a look at the ingredients\nOkay I'm personally ... sucrose sugar okay ... sugar sodium a score right\nThat's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium\nRide vegetables Derek acid mess that lubricant again and F DNC yellow number six there you go on a number six so now that's artificially colored vitamin C. now what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different from these that we are talking about\nWell what's different about as I used twenty two different forms of vitamin C. and it's all naturally flavored natural colors there's nothing artificial in it Chris so it's good for you\nIt's the only one that has this unique delivery method of being able to drink it down as water soluble goes right to work in your body and

at the University of California\nAnd it found that people who took vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease were reduced over forty percent ... study reported in the international journal vitamin a nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes out here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C in their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Mila leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system or energy that's just from vitamin C. wow\nNow earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work\nWell this is the kind of groundbreaking research on vitamin C. and weight loss but what happens is vitamin C is a natural appetite suppressant and it also increases your metabolism and your energy when your energy goes up yeah start feeling better you can go out and take a walk let's burn some of it off\n[noise] so you've created this supersede twenty to formulate its

I Know I Am I'm you know Dr brings with all of this emerging information that's out there why do you think we're not hearing more about the benefits\nOf vitamin C. it's not a sexy trend but vitamin C. has survived the test of time because it's been around it was discovered in the Nineteen thirties ... vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies in fact one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years\nWell who who should I mean is there a perfect candidate that you can describe that that should be like it's a no brainer beyond your super see twenty two formula\nWell yes I Would say first of all if you're listening out there and you're over the age of sixty it's a no brainer\nThere you you absolutely need to get on my super see formula because you manifest symptoms more readily than younger people mhm for those of you who are younger and your child bearing years ... is necessary for you and your baby and those of you and your forties and fifties and\nThese are the ages that I call your insurance age vitamin C is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself ... so he had on it even if you're not manifesting symptoms get on it and stay on it okay and for those of you who have teenagers or young children I started my son very very young on super see\nAnd I can tell you I can count on one hand the number of times he's been sick through his childhood and teen years so when I say it's super see it is super see [laughter] it's a great formula and\nAnd I'm so when people ask me what they can do the only way to do anything to affect your family and your household is take control back over your own power produced Sharon pay less for P. Y. O. P. produce your own power\nAnd pay less for it then if the power companies want to raise the rates once a week it's not going to affect you working with me you're going to I'm going to design a system for you not a cookie cutter system it is not about just\nSolar panels on your roof anymore the power companies have made sure that your rate plans are so complicated it's not just about covering all of your power\nBecause at nighttime ... you need to buy some power from them at nighttime so there's a there's a lot more to this is it is it's done incorrectly and I've heard lots of bad solar stories and that's where the bachelor stories come from if it's not done correctly with the right amount of electricity being produced on your roof\nWith the right weight plan and with demand management because many of these rape plans that you can only be on with solar if you do not manager demand that adjuster that's charging you very very highly\nA a a very ... much higher charge for your power between three and eight PM a PS and s R P it's one to one does a one to eight and three to six\nIf you don't manage your demand you could end up having still a very high bill connected to the electric company so this is why I say to people I use the analogy\nThere is lots of companies out there that can make hamburgers there is only one that has the secret sauce I Am not trying to throw anybody under the bus I'm not trying to say anything bad about any other company I'm just saying make sure when you're going to consider P. Y. O. P.\nThat you're working with somebody who cares just like I cared about my daughter and my grandkids home to make sure it was done correctly\nBecause in my experience there's a lot of solar sales people out there and I'm not one of them\nI'm not a soldier sales person I'm a mom and grandma and retired nurse\nThat figured out that this was a very good solution for my own daughter and my own family at reducing the cost of their power which they would continue to need\nFor for for as long as they're in the house so basically they're going to be paying a power bill or power cost every month every year for decades to come\nAnd that's what we're all faced with so the only way to get away from what's going on with that's affecting our power companies a the electric companies want to charge us more for the same power they sold us last year and now politics getting involved in it and there's these prop one twenty sevens and God only knows what else is coming down the pike\nIs produced your own power\nAnd you're going to pay less for between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nThe average hopeful Jeremy if they just use the average amount of electricity over the next Twenty years with a very conservative number three percent increases over the next Twenty years played the as we've seen increases a far greater than twenty percent this year so I'm being very conservative when I say\nThese increases we don't know what they will be year after year after year and they keep sending out email or messages and advertisement you know little jingles like oh be energy efficient whatever the only way to be energy efficient and be able to afford to live comfortably in your home is go out of the house\nDuring the daytime and go to the mall or go to the movie theater which is absolutely ridiculous you've worked so hard\nTo live comfortably in your home you for your family your retirement et cetera and these power companies that are dictating to us how much power we can use and how ... it is it are unaffordable ... unaffordable that is when we use it it's absolutely atrocious so\nThe way that you get you get ahead of this and you don't have to worry about this anymore\nIs go to my website um Germany is going to give that out call me\nI'm again ... ... we we can we can all collectively go down and rant and rave at at group meetings and try and be heard in front of the Arizona corporation mission I just talked to somebody this week that he was on the ballot he didn't meet the primary he is a great guy great Christian man\nHow they don't want the people on the Arizona corporation which I'm Sorry I'm I'm not saying that everybody ... corporation your mission but I'm telling you I've heard more of a good people that have not gotten on to the Arizona corporation commission because I think it's the old boys' network so again so you don't let these things affect your family your hustles budget\nGo to my website filled out the killer worksheet and keeps telling me how much power you used how badly how's your bill increased um in two thousand Eighteen from two thousand Seventeen and let's get you're producing your own power paying less for it and so these things won't ever affect your family in your household budget ever again\nYeah I heard some people talk about how easy it is and you're right you just go to the website\nAsks solar Sandy dot com that ask solar Sandy dot com or you can call six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine one more time six to three eight five zero\nEighty two twenty ninth and sometimes you'll hear a say don't fall for the fake people these are why we get bad stories everybody who works with us we know they're going to have great outcomes so we want you to get the real deal that's why you gotta ask\nSolar Sandy dot com ask solar Sandy dot com\nYou know it's so funny Jeremy I feel like I'm On a on a roll on on a tangent today but I so I'm so upset about um I I've been in homes this summer where people have kept\nA thermostat at eighty five eighty eight um the next increase or new fee taxes surcharge that they decided to add on somebody's bill\nWhat Ninety Ninety five degrees to the point where people's health\nAnd wellbeing are being compromised because of the greed of these power companies\nSo again you know five years ago in my daughter's neighborhood there was only maybe two homes that had solar on it now there is only two homes that don't so it's really important everyone\nI Know that you probably at some point now are starting to look at oh my gosh are we going to be able to afford our power bills and he'll just sheer some of you haven't even seen the full impact of it your own budget building with a PS you could end up with the federal amount at the end of the year it could be five hundred it could be a thousand dollars\nThis is how deceptive these new rate plans are on a PS recommended rate plans for he said oh they're very similar to your old rate plan\nMakes sure I'm sure that you're on by may first some people were migrated over be before me first but you're on the budget billing you may not see the full extent of a PS is\nUm you know impact on your family is ... ... ... families in hopefuls budget\nBecause if you aren't paying the right amount on your budget billing you will have what's called the federal amount at the end of the year if you do not pay that settled them out your power will get shut off so at the end of your Christmas or just after Christmas didn't your lessons on December\n... can you imagine getting a a a several amount for eight hundred thousand dollars Germany or could there be a worse time right\nAnd if you and you know if you don't pay that\nYour power gets ... and if you don't head on time you get taken off budget building\nSo by producing your own power ... so there is a way for me to help my abs families eliminate owing anything to a pass you're going to produce all the power you need for your home your day your nighttime and a little bit extra\nThere was a deadline that I was talking about in previous weeks August thirty first it was the vibe that program anybody that worked with me and got in before August thirty first\nThey had to buy back of twelve point nine for any extra power that they didn't consumed during the day they were sending to a PS is good and they were buying it for twelve point nine\nA PS apparently four hundred and eighty eight million dollars isn't enough for them so they're now dropping that under review with Arizona corporation commission you think they're going to get the approval of course they are down from twelve point nine to all of them points that it has not been enacted yet I cannot guarantee that\nUm even if today you got if I got your application and with a PS two you're going to get the whole point nine but yet in before they take the ... point six cents away from us completely\nSo any extra power you're exporting back to the grid is a monetary credit on your bill not a kilowatt hour credit a monetary credit so those killer credits are starting to produce a monetary credit on your bill\nCovers these taxes and your nighttime power so at the end of the year I have many of my families that are going to have checks back one thousand two thousand maybe even more back at the end of this year so again\nSo you are locked into your own rate of between seven and half and ... cents per kilowatt daytime nighttime that will be you know you're you're you're on ... on the off peak power that you're producing on your roof will be arranged between seven and half and eating out cents per kilowatt\nIf you go to a PS his website and are familiar with those those refunds right now there is no rape plan on a pits as let's say or ... either that offers your power on peak her off peak at a guaranteed rate of seven and half the eight and ... cents per kilowatt that locks you win for the next twenty five thirty years\nThat's the only way that you can lock in your own power prices by producing it yourself and not being subject to\nFuture and there's going to be more of them many more of them and things like prop one twenty seven is going to impact our costs a PS\nAs opposed to this [noise] the reason they're opposed to this they're up already pencil into their um their operating costs fifty nine hundred megawatts of natural gas plant\nWhich there's they're going to make a lot of profit on building the natural gas plants they do not want to add solar onto their operating costs because at the reduced\nPhoenix is a market for
