calls here's Len Len thanks for hanging out with us how are you\nBy my good good you know we keep saying that uh the FBI does not come to conclusions they just record the activities of the accused however with Khomeini and investigating Hillary\nCame out with those big announcement that they'd come to the conclusion that there was no no no prosecutor would bring charges against her so\nIt's a good point I mean it's you know it is I mean we have to remember that but there is a mouse do as a as a seventh background check this is not the kind of FBI investigation or special Bob Mueller as special counsel dragging on and on and carrying on for this is a background investigation and this was interviewing people putting in a report what they said\nFind that there's any cooperation looking at the corroborating witnesses talking to them and putting it in a report it given it to the Senate Judiciary committee that's all it is I'm ... and that's I'm\nNot going to be satisfied anybody as we progress as I think but maybe it will be enough for some senators to vote yes including a couple of Democrats crushed welcome how are you crash\nI'm doing well my point I wanted to bring up was a personal one where my mom was sexually assaulted in the worst matter and I won't use the word you can imagine what I'm Talking about our\nMen are almost put put away and murdered and share something with me the other day by Dr Ford that really made a lot of sense she said the testimony where she talks about going into the supermarket to say hello to the accuser or one of the accuses that would never happen\nThat would never happen my mother couldn't even go into a shopping mall for years and could not when she had to face the accuser record and and in a line up\nShe's not going to say Hi to the guy in a grocery we're not going to say that they had received about it why would you\nDid you hear the Lindsey Graham a line about the the woman who claimed that she witnessed gang rapes going on at ten parties\nAfter the first one do you think you'd go back nine more times he got if you're watching my ideas yeah lots of ... lots of questions I'm very reluctant to question the credibility of accuser only because I'm mindful that and I said there's a million times there are a lot\nSo women who've been abused and sexually assaulted they had no corroboration and they were orderly alone they lost their jobs they've lost their careers we've heard the stories and\nYou know you can't read these stories you hear about some of these accounts\nEven yesterday Jeff Flake was at some of that in Boston and we're going to play some video and audio from that but that is why I think Jeff Flake as a as a no he's playing to the media is playing to his Democratic friends and there were a bunch of people standing in the front rows of whatever event he was out in Boston holding up signs saying I was a sexual assault\nSurvivor or I'm a survivor or something like that and and honest to goodness I I I I feel great compassion for anybody who has been assaulted who has been attacked to has been um victimized and they got nowhere to go uh\nAnd and they work maybe in a in a they happened in the

paying attention to this\nUm I Know you think I'm pulling your leg let me repeat that the New York times has discovered that Brett Kavanaugh allegedly through some ice at a man in a bar in Nineteen eighty five\n[laughter] how one would think the whole nation would be laughing at such an absurd reveal let's see Nineteen eighty five\nThat's thirty three years ago Brett Kavanaugh would have been Twenty one in college at Yale got involved in some kind of an altercation in a bar and through some ice at a man\nNow\nBut that's the extent of it I mean nobody was arrested nobody went to jail the

I'm\nShow my show how are you my friend\nLike I'm doing just fine thanks\nGood good I Want to dive into the reason he wrote the book obviously social media is such an important part of so many people's lives and yet there's there are real perils to being kind of trapped in that social media bubble aren't\nYeah boy aren't there um [noise] you know we live and hyper connected world and we seem to be less connected to each other and never before and so that's the kind of thing I always want to address as to what it is\nThat makes us the kinds of people we become right where you know we find 'em just is lack of civility and I've been concerned about this for years about that the climate are personal in corporate civility [laughter] you know and this this connectedness between families and friends so\nWriting the book was my attempts to address those issues and maybe offer some\nSome really good thoughts and how we might get past that and analyze why we've got this far and things like that so who it was fun to do\nWell and I think the reason I was drawn to your message is why I like to book so much the biggest takeaway for me\nIs is abandoning the anonymity of the Internet and and and connecting with people face to face I mean it's been tough for me over the decades that I've done this for a living at least even with a caller that I talk to on this show where there's a name and there's a person and there's a voice\nIt's not really anonymously and yet social media has elevated anonymity to new heights\nAnd I fear in Bolden was really really awful awful online behavior Joe\nOh I don't think there's any doubt that I think we all see that and that's the problem with that in many that fosters cowardice I think at times and I take it enables us to have I'm blessed and best of our\nA Laker come out where we can say what we want to say um any kind of vitriol that we want to throw out there and have no accountability so part of the problem is accountability right\nUh what I face to face with you I I'm less likely to be that kind of person that if I were disconnected hiding behind this fire wall of personality\nAs I call it accountability is an important thing um and I think the problem with the enemy and many of the Internet is that we only become truly him and\nWhen we intersect with each other when I see in your eyes your soul\nWhen I hear your heartbeat when I hear the pop I'm telling you your dream and become more connected with you and I am less likely to be I'm against to when I find out that we are\nReally more alike than we seem to be and so those are the kinds of things I think an enemy preach on the Internet and leave the elevated at to an art form this ugliness and uh the problem is that many of our young people have a bigger relationship with their cell phones and with a friend\nAnd that just continues to compound the problem because oil leaning ladder against or wrong law to get to trick community and that's what I Try to deal with a notebook\nJob a jaguar she wrote an friended finding proof community in a disconnected culture because you can get it at Amazon and we have a link posted it online dot com or

when I'm treasury agents are taught to uh know counterfeit is sure\nThey do look for counterfeit ... get to know what the real thing looks like so well but the counterfeit this so I guess\nI think because many people live in a counterfeit culture\nThey haven't seen the real thing so our job is to help a limb and the real thing to them that will find\nA in their hearts something that says boy that so much better than what I'm doing now and so part of the issue is trying to help people understand what is the genius of ... community is about and the genius of our country which has found it on the knowledge that\nWe find that our motto which is one for many people are but soon ...\nMy ... not all of our bills and coins and the reality of that is when we understand that\nThe diversity

circled the group and yelled at its members wall chanting obscenities and destroying their signs if you read my column yesterday you will understand why people on the left to feel that the normal rules of civil society do not apply to them\n\nThat is what it is these are this is our version of the super match the over man the person who is above its really above man they're above the normal constraints that civil society and civilization put on people\nThat is how left disregard themselves they are not bound by Judeo Christian principles they are not bound by civil principles of the

law\nBy not prosecuting them they're saying you are above the law we agree with you on the left you are Wilbur mention\nOkay so that's a double standard issue what about the issue I have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans who are anti Kavanaugh on on the grounds of sex\nAlso not forgetting they're against them because they would be against any Republican nominee for the Supreme Court don't they have husbands brothers fathers sons who may love\nI mean why use all the identification visa Vee Vee Vee alleged victim\nAnd I was just talking to a group of hockey mom the other day and
