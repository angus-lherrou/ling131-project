Kavanaugh they figure this will be a major defeat for the president it will be incidentally if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed let's start with one of the big\nTakeaways of the last few days one of the biggest takeaways is watching this stunning\nUm crowing by left is an activist and progress lives over the weekend on social media about how getting in people's faces screaming at them shrieking at Penn cornering people like Jeff Flake\nEffect change this is why we do it\nThat's what they say Anna Marie Cox all these other folks got on social media this is why we get a new faces because it works Jeff Flake caving and Jeff Flake changing his mind after he was be raided by the activists\nIn the elevator and they are activists I don't know if they were sexually assaulted if they were my heart goes out to them as my heart goes out to any victim of sexual assault the Christian plaza de Ford was sexually assaulted my heart goes out to her\nAnd as the president said her testimony was compelling what makes this an fulfilling for everybody is the fact that judge Kavanaugh's testimony was compelling as well\nIf you are wrongly accused of such a horrific thing I Would think you'd react with the world watching precisely the way he did without a doubt\nAnd so we are left with a he said she said here's a major takeaway if Kavanaugh get derailed and the confirmation fails it's open season on every Republican in public office it is they're going they're going to because they believe that the getting\nIn somebody's face and shrinking and screaming and berating somebody in public\nWorks that's what Senator Jeff flake gave them on friday\nHe has to know it can't be a stupid man\nAnd a word about Jeff Flake before we open up our phone lines and we dive into all of this here on a Monday as we get ready wrap it up for what's going to be undoubtedly a very tough week are worried about Jeff Flake raging about him is as productive as complaining about the whether he is who he is\nHe admitted on sixty minutes last night shockingly but he would have never changed his mind the way he did friday if he were up for reelection\nHe told the world if I had any accountability

Dennis prayer in my second decade of doing that and of course it's been a real privilege\nAs always you can keep in touch with me at mark I saw her at AOL dot com M. A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. which many of you've done over the years and I appreciate that fact pour you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter at the markets for show and if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear\nBesides filling in for Dennis [noise]\nAlthough I must admit I intentionally use Facebook and Twitter much less so we know they're biased right and what what's the point that the film print what they want to write or at least the allow to appear [laughter]\nI'm In this hour I Want to talk about the disgraceful unless that has occurred in the nomination process for judge Kevin off and what it all\nMeans for me and you and for America first of all let's get this straight if you don't already know it left\nLiberals Democrats whatever you want to call them ... and ... about the same to me these days [noise] yeah I Know Dennis has a distinction they will do anything and everything to when they have no limits\nAnd they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable this isn't even the ... Ronald Reagan I don't know if you remember he would have drinks with the speaker Tip O'Neill years ago obviously and at night and he said and what should we were friends what's going on in the daytime I said that's the daytime when\nHe fought him too so now now of course you can't have a drink anymore because that is now disqualifying if you were on the right\nIt has become all out war anything and everything goes\nNow lying is kind of place you know with a Senator Harry Reid and write Romney's taxes someone told them that even pay taxes and later on he said well you know it was effective right that's the issue ended effect if not if it's true or the total insanity of the charge\nThat Kavanaugh was part of a group allowing for women to be gang raped are not gang rape the least about what they're doing standing in line\nThey are extreme that supposedly so much so that even the New York times wouldn't print that accusation but all of it is fair game\nAny actor is ... is to be treated seriously if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right stuff those are the rules so the salt that Keith Ellison I think he's running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota He may very well have made against his girlfriend\nIs he's running for attorney general doesn't matter as well ... shah was telling me the attorney general it doesn't matter the salty there against his girlfriend every dish but he's on the left\nAnd maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which you if you didn't know isn't exempt group these new rules only our fellow who's on the right\nThe ends justify any means we're evil and they are right check that correct they never want to be called right but that's all that matters there is no issue of whether they can go to sleep at night you know ... care because they know they're doing God's work\nAnd say even believe in God\nTheir God is more likely to be the God of left us or an anti conservative or anti Republican is and that is their religion and it doesn't matter who they destroy there is no negotiating with these people it is their way or the highway\nI have trouble watching their allies this past week\nEven though you know it's the talk show host to have to watch that circus\nThey didn't really care about that woman not really she was yes senator Booker I Would have said to you she was used as a pawn because because those on your side wouldn't have ignored a conservative woman with the same charges against a left this man you were using her\nAnd your accomplices of course in the media would barely cover it\nNeed I mentioned Kathleen Willie\nPaula Jones Anita Broderick the list actually goes on and on those women women sorry weren't on the left so it doesn't matter they're just road kill on the way to power I'm Sean I learn roadkill in Texas that's that's a French that they're\nThe Juanita Broderick right right right they actually hypocrisy of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nI'm surprised they didn't have another Spartacus moment wasn't that at a spark his feet right didn't he admits sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other phone is on the panel they talk about taking the high moral ground [noise]\nThese hypocrites have actually reach new lows cost loan Bob moral high ground\nEvery time I can think they go you know they can't get a lower than this they break new ground [noise]\nTell me that is my first question to you\nHow you were able to contain herself I Won a prayer seven seven six these people's disgust me I Can't watch or listen to that in fact when I did was I was teaching part time and so every time a Democrat got and I knew I had to listen but I kind of ... a little bit\nI it's hard to take it's really hard to take [noise] Kavanaugh was not even my first choice by the way to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nIf the pope was Trump's nominee and he has left us make no mistake about it they wouldn't have been against him it doesn't matter if Trump appointed by the way why didn't have to they need hearing your future FBI investigations when they know\nHow they're going to vote they already know answer to suffering people like Jeff Flake\nTalk about being name correctly you know as soon as I heard his name I have some doubts he said if you remember he would vote for Kavanaugh\nAnd hysterical woman confronts him and he admits that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation can you believe that Jeff Flake is a fool vista lake will not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats\nIt will further divide us this is all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham hadn't just right\nThis is all about power and I and all of us probably could take more easily if they just said what they felt but they're a bunch of phony hypocrite left us\nWho disgust me tell me what you think you'd want to prayer seven seven six but it's worse than that because we now have taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence\nYou can charge anybody with any crime you want\nAnd you don't even need to have corroborating evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruin their lives\nAnd there are no consequences for the accusers because it's very difficult you have to prove that they did it with mouse do you remember Ronald Reagan's secretary of labor I think his name was a secretary Donovan\nWhen asked after he was found innocent of some charges I don't remember the charges anymore after he was found innocent they said something about where we go next to what are you going to do now and he said something like where do I go to get my reputation back exactly where ... tell me\nDoes judge Kavanaugh will go to get his reputation back\nIt's gone now at least for a lot of people the Democrats and the left have ruined his reputation and some like Feinstein have the nerve to question his belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do Senator Feinstein after you helped destroyed his life act\nEver so serene as you ruined his life and his life of his family and his Dennis has pointed out we're is his bank account for all the good work he's done for all these years\nHow did Bill Clinton by the way stay is president after what he did with the complicity of you Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate\nThis was not a good week for American I Want to know what you think that one a prayer seven seven six and I can see the board is already filled but you know I I go to calls pretty fast\nUm I look at different times you know what how come here on the actor and writer of what I never heard of that because I don't do and I mean we should care\nAnd they had those I don't know if anyone else don't look like they are either I thought that she never clean them and almost gave her this little cat can kind of ...\nA ... actually I Know one hand yeah I ...\nI actually heard that you had including the glasses for thirty five years [laughter]\nAt the\nEnd she got to ask for it and she went to college in\nWait wait wait wait wait wait wait I Do oh you telling me you respect ... degrees master's degree you know I'm\nJust saying I think there's a huge\nThreat maybe that's not the right one now but yeah I I I don't care\nFor one thing that I I Want to mention is and I've not heard anyone say there um when they asked her about her ... and she would cut from there\nUm she she talked about the practical she got somehow catch it every sector I'm thinking about that as a former fourteen year old girl either for cell phone and next we'll end what are called her and said you\nKnow she I remembering my outcome huh well I should get home one of my family didn't she didn't she think she was reading at least give her a car and\nYou know what happened after Iraq or any kind of things that are all that you're holding her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on it\nAnd yet when you disappointed in the prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this is going to reach a climax in\nDividing yeah and I think yeah I mean you don't want it to the new drink and then she was gone my heart sank because I got boy oh boy you can go now you were done for and I was\nSo proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came and got his players and and anybody that you know make fun of him crying Corker bringing up daughter I guess for them\nThey had what would you not do it and they were accused of something so horrific well yeah and but you can't have a negative\nWell of course and you can't win because if he had been come they would have said well he was accused of all the heat index but now ... and the other St Louis to belligerent to be a justice I Can't win with him ... that's the point you did it will think she'd critical shirts\nYou you can't win with them how could you win was um it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter
