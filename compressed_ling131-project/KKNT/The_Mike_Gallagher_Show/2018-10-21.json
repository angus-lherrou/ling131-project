concerns so Dr biggest what is this how secret that you've been talking about\nWell what the secret is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C.\nVitamin C. All right well uh vitamin C is is not really new though\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell\nAnd unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends in the bottom line is with out enough vitamin C. and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies\nDiabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be short and by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contained or sixty five milligrams\nOf vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three to four thousand yeah and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice so because of a lack of vitamin C. they were getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well the number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just don't any energy I don't feel like myself I'm hurting yeah and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we've got to do these tasks send you through the scanner\nAnd the problem is is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd what's interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. All right and the other ones are any pigs primates and the fruit bat\nWhen you look at the rest of the animals out there you don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure\nYou don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. huh and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nMilk produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired\nSick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it you know right but you know I think most people get myself included sink and vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the morality\nThat were suffering from is that you know what it is actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my super see twenty two formula\nAnd as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down if you have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... is your body needs different forms of it\nAnd I put it all into one vitamin formula now and you said that was how much vitamin C. and your supersede twenty two four years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by taking supersede twenty two then what what are some of the the things that you'll experience\nWell the first thing you're going experiences energy vitamins the produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is okay if I read an email to sure for sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped it he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days\nHe said no another thing that happened is I became more alert\nAnd I now have a clear head off and vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nI Want to let you listeners know that if you want to get a free book about vitamin C. N. try Dr ... says supersede twenty two formula absolutely risk free there's a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I sat in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I did go to the supermarket before I got here [laughter]\nOkay and I brought some vitamin C. and I I went and bought these and I'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in itself\nRight off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nRight so this one has a vitamin C. well it's just one type of ...\nBut gas it right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... now cellulose has grown up newspaper\nAlright the next one is uh vegetables Derek Ghassan now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form of a and the next one is a sort of like a silica sand sand like the beach\nAll right so here's another one try this one here okay so we are the national brand here right right so it was five hundred milligrams okay this is a true all yes All right so take a look at the ingredients\nThat okay I'm person gr is sucrose sugar okay ... sure sodium a score right\nThat's a form of vitamin C\nThat's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium but vegetables therapist said that that lubricant again and F DNC yellow number six there you go number six so now that's artificially colored vitamin C. now what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different\nFrom these that

reported in the international journal vitamin a nutrition concluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes out ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C in their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Miller leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system or energy that's just sort of vitamin C. wow now earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work well this is the kind of groundbreaking research on\nVitamin C. and weight loss but what happens is vitamin C is a natural appetite suppressant and it also increases your metabolism and your energy when\nYour energy goes up yeah you start
