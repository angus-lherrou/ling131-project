I've got a video clip speaking\nOf Mike online dot com you might want to watch this that will play in about four minutes so I'm going to give you time to if you're near a computer to go to Mike online dot com and see a fiery exchange between CNN's Don Lemon\nAnd the Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis over what constitutes a mob and at one point lemon got so angry he told his invited guests to shut up\nBut it's just how nuts the left has gotten their full of rage after judge Kavanaugh\nWas confirmed to the United States Supreme court they can't believe they didn't shut him down they can't believe some of these poll numbers\nAnd they're expressing it in ways that really reveal who they are Hillary Clinton for example\nA it was announced that bill and Hillary like a like a traveling a road show all this reminds me of his like the Barnum Bailey circus they're going to go from city to city touring\nTo gather bill and Hillary Clinton I'm trying to picture what what how people would react how the mainstream media would react to the announcement the Georgian Barbara Bush were going to go on a multi city ... million dollar tour\n[laughter] can you imagine what the Washington Post would be saying about\nOh the New York times or Don Lemon\nAnd and and I'm not kidding you want to get in and watch this video clip about two minutes away I'll play it or where things got very heated on CNN now again I I say there's often CNN is really on the kids these days and and I don't mean that with an ugly\nI mean I don't have any dog him on I don't care who wins and the cable news wars but it's a Fox News MSNBC cable news world right now she and it isn't a distant third and you're about to see why\nThey put their face and a guy like Don Lemon\nWho is just as it becomes on glued when a gash rightfully points out that Democrat\nActivists in protesters who chased a U.S senator out of a restaurant or indeed a mop Don Lemon doesn't think that's mob mentality Don Lemon is a Democrat\nPeriod\nBut let's listen to the way that you almost became president ever so close ... close she could she could feel it she could taste\nBut alas she didn't make it across the finish line the American people rejected Hillary Clinton has she still can't quite get over it evidently listen to what she said about Democrats Republicans\nAnd civility loses a cutting number eight audio courtesy of CNN\nCannot be hitting all with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nWin back the house formed on panel that Clinton Melanie can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican whom to\nRecognize angered train [noise]\nAnd you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\n... did you hear the lady who would be president just threaten the country because that's what she's doing she's threatening the entire country you better\nUnderstand she's saying you can't be shovel with Republicans not until Democrats gained control of the house and the Senate she almost became president\nWith that kind of mindset and of course thankfully the voters saucer our call them deplorable ... herder demean more than half the country with the wave of her hand\nKnows who she is and what she is\nBut you're not going to have a Democrat in today's party condemn Hillary Clinton's comments you're not going to have a Democrat condemned the behavior\nOf these protesters who are hounding Republicans and conservatives in the public space chasing a Fox News channel personality through the subway in New York\nHarassing him trying to get people to to try to incite people against him\nTo know what would happen if these two so called Democrat liberal comedians who harassed Brian kill made on the subway with the video rolling 'cause they think they're so cute if somebody stuck in a knife in Bryan kill made what they'd be saying that they took the video down by the way from their stupid no nothing cowardly site\nBut these are Democrats here's a Democrat John Lennon looking check this video out last night he's got Matt Lewis a Daily Beast columnist talking about the behavior of today's Democrats again don't get don't get\nFooled or snow covered by labels like antifa or\nFascists or even protesters right these are Democrats

pattern that was spreading out court remember for the very old storm when she reached the U.S east coast or they bought people they know about what it's worth it her first three or four days she also exploded out there in the landing so this storm\nCame into a pattern that believe it or not I can't remember if I said if you might say to a lot of people I told him I think he will not Tobar again

you don't watch the bike watching Twitter and seasoning sent and all that stuff up\nAnd what about we set it up for a long way far away but you could see this pattern this is the same pattern that cause Gordon Albert Florence to hit the United states pressure over the north east we call that the new memorial wow and it set up\nAnd it directs any energy\nAimed at the United states of the topics and where do you get developed it otherwise the wider Caribbean in the Gulf of Mexico so ... there are all set up\nYou know I I always get my my I always just just just kind of gas when I see the the the shots of these giant cranes where there's construction or there's a bunch of cranes along the coast and they and they loosen them so that they'll spin around like a top\nBut man Joe with wins around a hundred and forty five hundred and fifty miles an hour\nI I got to believe that there is a pretty good likelihood that those cranes are gonna come crashing down\nWhere where are those ... in Panama City\nYeah there were Panama City I saw a video this morning Panama City and I think actually just along the panhandle when I didn't get to I think Panama City there was like three or four giant enormous cranes and then they explained to tell you they loosen them they don't so they should have spent\nBut they're huge you know that there's a giant construction cranes and\nMan I I don't know the answer that I Do know that that's an environmentalist and I know a lot of people never say global warming issue I yeah I I I sometimes marvel that what we think we're going to the beach\n[noise]\nAll my friends I [noise] I watch\nActually I listen to Nikki Haley's conference with the president [noise] where it was announced that she\nWas leaving the United nations at the end of the year she had already pull the president this [noise] prior to the I don't know when ... was it made clear several months ago Romney so there's speculation as to why she leaving\nBecause of course nothing could actually happen\nFor orderly and knock us reasons\nSeems to me that two years in the United nations\nOr one should be up for a monument somewhere in the capital especially if you confronted the bad guys of the world is Nikki Haley has and I was done by during the eight years abroad Cole bomber\nAnd keeping true to a major left wing\nAttitude toward life you\nWhen you don't fight this is an ancient to tell them you to phrase those who are cruel to the kind of oil better because those were kind to the crew will be cruel to the kind\nThat is a motto of power deer fellow citizens of the left ... liberals but on the left\nAnd that is that they are kind to the cruel like the Iranian regime and they are cruel to the kind like Israel that's a perfect pitch truly a perfect example there was something truly sick\nThere's a there's a morality of the conscience for those who are kinder to Iran than to Israel\nOr to ... to ... us or to all of them\nMickey Haley has been extraordinary if the United nations Donald Trump has been extraordinary that the United nations\nAfter all the United nations ambassador reflect the will of the president of the United states\nI repeat that the risk of what\nIs the risk but I think of it the what is the risk my sings at us far the president of the United states has\nBeen a great president\n... well the risk\nIs that you alienate those who hate the president but I have a model with regard to that\nI adopted this when I ... in my first full time job and I was ... the director of a Jewish Institute in California that's why I moved from New York to California in my twenties to direct this Institute\nThey had weekend retreats was gorgeous facility thirty two hundred acres\nThey had this summer sessions for young people and I would advocate God's existence and I would advocate\nObservance of the laws in the Bible and so on and\nSome members of the board or very afraid\nOf my advocacy of God's existence an observance of the laws of the Bible and so on\nAnd they uh they would say to me you know not not not with hatred or anything like that that just they would be worried and they would say you know you'll alienate some of the people who come and I developed a great phrase that has guided me you can't alienate the alienated\nThey already worry alienated [laughter]\nThat's why they showed up [laughter] somebody you know a friend begging them to cover somebody treated them through a weekend or whatever\nSo you know I'll alienate people by saying that the president of the United states has been great bus far I don't think that those people have already not been alienated you said it's all it takes is is a favorable word of a mirror vote for Republican\nAnd you're pro rape you understand how ... become there are no limits to what the left will say that there are no moral limits to what they will do or say\nWho is this person who tweeted out that the take a hit you know do something for the good guys and that somebody should take out Brett Kavanaugh\nTeacher it was a teacher with\nA special ed teacher in Minnesota and and so this is one cracks me up a ... so was this on a Facebook account or a tweet showed Twitter has decided to suspend this person's account suspend\nYou of publicly cold for murder and your your account is suspended didn't suspend James was too cold for no no violence whatsoever who's barely a well by the way he is truly\nOne of the ... people in the country I I don't read many tweets but I read I read his my wife sure been chosen to me\nIt's a it's an extraordinary thing\n\nSo anyway ah he has been great it is an astonishing thing I Do worry I admit it or would like to let me can I have a Wall Street journal here yeah I I admit it\nI'm just saying I worry what do you think that because I support the president I have abandoned critical fought and I may be wrong by the way I was just telling you I'm worried I'm telling you I oppose what he's doing\nBut I Am worried U.S China strains deep and and I will there is only one reason one\nThat I Am worried about us China relations you know what it might be\n\nDon't think the Chinese would invade Taiwan metal Taiwan so good guess North Korea\nI think that if China says to Kim Jong un don't continue the nuclear reservation\nAnd then he won't he's too reliant on China ... China's way of holding us hostage is is North Korea there is no no no other\nSo that's the reason I worry about the fact that China has abused the world Trade Organization that it is abused intellectual property it's I I personally a worry more about China's about Russia\nOr for a whole host of reasons I and I think the Chinese nationalism is growing\nAt ... China I Know a fair amount about China because of my involvement with Chinese people and ... people don't know how corrupt China's that corruption is a way of life in China\nFrom inside I Know for example people often pay for pay for judges\nThey not only pay the judge they pay to get the judge and then get the verdict that they want\nIt's a it's\nA truly in many ways I mean\nNot all Chinese I mean Chinese come to the United states for example they become spectacularly successful by\nA surgeon [laughter] because it's such an example of who was considered somewhat of a genius and my my recent uh injury of my eye which by the way is getting better and better thanks to the treatment that I have been receiving the chief\nThe person involved in my I work including laser surgery is also a parents are Chinese\nYou don't have to show me on the capabilities of Chinese people but ...\nIs devoid of values because of many reasons the biggest of course being the communism communism rapes a country of its values it empties better than rapes it empties a country of its values\nNothing there's nothing left after communism it leaves a gigantic cold now Christians are filling it somewhat but the persecution of Christians in China has increased all of this is to tell you\nThat it is totally understandable that at some point someone some president interested in America is going to have to confront China better sooner than later however I worry because of North Korea\nWas Saturday ride sat through like it was a month ago it's just a few days ago since that vote\nIf you listen to the quote unquote mainstream media that by the ... I prefer to call the fake news industrial complex I didn't come up with that the guy who\nShe had no fits within the White House my former colleague Andrew so rabies mouth to communicate it came up with Andrew full credit credit is due the fake news industrial complex doubling down it's quite amazing we have some audio from Don Lemon or from I think last night and we also have some audio\nFrom Hillary Clinton that if it's a ...
