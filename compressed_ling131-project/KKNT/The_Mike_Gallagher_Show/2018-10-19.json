Facebook followers on Twitter today just go to nine sixty the Patriot dot com for more information [noise]\nWe can actually started to show\nI haven't spoken about to show me the issue [noise]\nAll sort of see how it played out [noise]\nIt's obvious the man who was murdered [noise]\nBased on anything anybody can imagine it's indefensible morally indefensible crime was committed against them and [noise]\nThere's a lot about the man that I don't know I don't know what his views where he is portrayed as a liberal in Saudi Arabia against an autocratic\nRegime but there are other reports about him but no matter what his views that this is obviously not something we can morally accept the question that looms larger than that however is why is there so much attention being paid here\nDissidents or regime opponents in the middle east are routinely murdered ...\n... it's one of the great puzzles of life but I think I have an answer to this one but it is often a puzzle as to why something dominate the news\nAnd something else doesn't the Saudi or the Saudi regime and got rid of someone wanted to get rid of\nAnd now in the year twenty Eighteen this is international\nNews to the extent that it is an ongoing daily story\n\nGiven how many people who who oppose Assad get tortured to death\nOr or in the Egyptian regime or in other often African regimes other Arab countries of a Muslim countries for how many people have been tortured to death in Iran can you ...\nSo why why is this so much of a fixation\nThe question is not whether or not we accept what happens\nTo question is why is there a fixation on this man well one reason as he wrote columns for the Washington Post so he has a connection to the west and specifically to the United states and the number is that we have photographic\nData\nWith regard to I mean there man walks into a consulate and never walk south\nIt's pretty damning than we have that on video we have on video of their men entering\nAnd we have the information about those men are entering turkey and then leaving turkey so everything is obvious why the Saudi regime or elements of the Saudi regime would want to get rid of this man that's a puzzle to me\nDid you ever hear of this guy I I'm I immersed myself in world affairs and I've ever heard of the guy\nAnd and and by the way and if you read the columns they're not exactly a\nSin to leaving or revealing or or anything I mean it's the Washington Post onto the show to ride around a lot of understand that I Wish they had an Iranian writer\nWho was who was a district with a guy would be a dead on arrival deal way so here's my theory as to why they were such preoccupation with this man\nAnd there are two reasons in my opinion one is Saudi Arabia is an ally of the United states\nAnd the the media are far more preoccupied with the bad things that allies do than the bad things that enemies to\nYeah you might want to ask why because I don't know fully this is a this is Dale speculation\n\nThey would I think they would argue we we have influence on the allies we don't have influence on enemies\nTherefore on those that we can influence we should try to have some influence that's the most noble\nRead of the preoccupation with the deprivation of allies as opposed to the deprivation of enemies\nRight there's ... there's nothing I'm the dissidents in Iran and when Iran did in fact have an uprising during the\nDuring the Obama administration she essentially said nothing and the ... that was defended by the entire liberal slash left media because it was ... bomber\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is it you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people to think well up themselves\nAnd we we can feel good about ourselves that we are bringing to the world's attention\nSomething terrible that they're an ally of the United states that the second reason\nIs that she is not only an ally of the Saudi regime was not only in LA of states an ally of the most hated man in\nThe world most hated man in the world for the left is about Kim Jong un and it is about the ayatollah I mean me and that is not the\nEnd is knocked Bush shuttle Assad's diet is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media because of the world's media run by the left\nNonetheless tapes him more than any of them and if she has a friend the friend is hated\n\nThose are the two reasons so why don't we supposed to do here is the question on the table what are we supposed to do we can't deny and it's because it's it would be a lawyer and you can tell lies kept an eye on what the Saudi regime did did it doesn't go up all the way to the crown prince we don't know\nBut it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently who are engaged in this murder so what are we supposed to do\n[noise] cancel a hundred billion dollars what what is this something that they ever ordered it and then five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of ... that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well as in ... more important than jobs to which the answer is what is ... ... yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there are two big caviar here one is jobs is a moral issue\nIt's not it's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can get a naval tens of thousands of Americans to work\nBut if but murder is murder I I I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of moral bad that's a very big component of my moral thinking but\nThe a lot of save the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two most important if you really want to talk more real than the greatest moral good right now might be in the world the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside its borders\nIt's it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the ... the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that light a more decent place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater goods the most obvious example being a man of didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nRight it's a all what it's an ally and it's a\nAnd that they they they have disproportionate the same people would the on the show issue all the ones who are this purport Israel's disproportional response not every body there are some people who have their moral compass right and I don't want to say again\nThat murder of cars showcase despicable\nIn life the question is not only correctly labeling bad\nActs as bad acts it's what do you do about them afterwards\n[laughter]\nThat's that's the way it works on ... in the real world the real world is not pleasant and then the real world you will fight evil with people who are morally\nTroubled themselves and in\nThis case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nAlright\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings for Democrats take control of the Senate\nI as I Am Feinstein has so deteriorated as a moral figure or because of the running against a radical leftist she's just the regular leftist Kevin delay on\nSo for her the issue is how do I win\nNot bought his right they will open hearings again on the Supreme Court justice I Want you to understand something about the Democratic party today because it's a left wing liberal party\nEvery institution it doesn't control it wishes to destroy you realize that\nIt doesn't control the electoral college wishes to destroy it does in wishes and the electoral college it doesn't control the Supreme Court for the first\nTime in my lifetime and in a lifetime of any of the senators\nSo
