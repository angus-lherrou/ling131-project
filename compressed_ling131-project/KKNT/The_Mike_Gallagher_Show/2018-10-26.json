like\nThe man is a a a cook on the right and he has a a they have his band and Sam is plastered with Donald Trump stickers and like\nSo we will ah let's see we have even more information just coming in now he's in his fifties\nAnd let's see what else we can say arrest made in connection with male explosive devices white fan outside plantation auto zone appears to be focused on the best the gators and if you get the pictures\nOf it ah [noise]\nYou conceive of the the pro Donald Trump\nStickers and people look if it's conceivable the guys on the left that he wants to make believe these all the right but I suspect that this is the real deal piece as simply a he was already it's interesting he had already been arrested in the past he has a record for making terror threats\nWhy people who make terror threats are not in jail is one of my butt rentals I don't understand why they have to actually acted out [noise]\nYou can't threaten death terror and the like and that would be sufficient to place you are in prison might I don't know I'm a I'm just a question that I posing [noise]\nSo what is going to happen and it's already happening is you see we told you it's a Trump rhetoric that caused the Trump rhetoric that caused the truck prior to Donald Trump to be left and the right got along great\nThe left was not calling us all of us all of us all of us racist and all I I'm not ... they were not calling the police a racist\nAnd even on occasion pigs this none of this was happening guy who pay portrays the police's pigs on his socks and I'm In a a football game in a is a chosen by Nike to be a spokesman ... this is all us as well because of Trump presumably\nWhen Charles Murray one of the most talked for people in the country uh it goes to speak at Middlebury College and or is it physically attacked and a woman oh the professor with him is injured by left wing students now that's all Trump\nShe ... this is the amazing thing\nOnly only the rights views hate is is the lie that one of the grand lies I should make a list I have to do that for myself the grandest of the laws\nThe greatest of the law is is that America is racist or the or the other number one is that we were Nazis right I mean come on\n... and ... you remember how fast the steam Scalia and the uh the shooting at at a Republican congressman putting a baseball game or how fast that disappeared from the news I mean you get updates on Steve ... a condition and that would be it\n\nBut now this thing right right it before the elections I mean this guy aside from just being ... evil in his ...\nAm sick is stupid stupid every if if\nIf the left could have invented the guy they would have invented the guy if he turns out to be the right wing or that it that it apparently he he is I say apparently\nBecause of the of the van but as soon as I heard ... and then in ... in the beginning I thought this could this could well be a guy on the left because it's so often these folks to take place\nBut there's more information came in and my thought about a moron I realize who the targets for talk for me to imagine these these were the ideal targets of somebody who does have people\nOn the left on the real the people on the left would have picked the same targets if they were trying to blame the right to\nFind out more and I will let you know any more information as it is revealed to the public of the United states of America so I have a very interesting thing for you here very interesting [noise]\nToday a look see David Brooks in the New York times who ... the New York times has three columnist author of about twenty that are knocked on the left\nAnd David Brooks is one of them there were none that are on the rights there are a non ... which is fine but they're they're not really on the right I remember in words I don't\nDon't believe I Know for a fact there was not a single pro Trump columnist of the twenty twenty five columnist of the New York times about one half the country\nIt's pro Trump and not a single Columbus they could not find a human being an ... I take that back reports they could find a human being they would not publish a human being who was pro Trump on the opinion page\nThe um the New York times of the New York times so but David Brooks is not is not on the left and you just do it I Would say is a centrist is quite anti Trump but he wrote a piece in which he spoke about how beautiful nationalism is that he is a nationalist he's not a global list\nWhich in the New York times that gutsy thing to do of course he spoke about how Donald Trump\nIs a good nationalist either because otherwise he would be unacceptable to the New York Times' readership defeated also attack\nDonald Trump I'm not saying about some searing it unfairly telling you that that's what happened\nBut the article the column was a pro nationalism pieces I remember I spent some time on that it's very important the president said he's a national list any attack the global lists and he was laughed at CNN and my play the laughter I mean they actually laughed at it\nSo now I what I find even more interesting than the columns or the comments by readers so I Want to retrieve some of the comments of New York times readers to New York times\nColumn ... the virtues of nationalism\nIn which he says I Love my nation you know and it's a good thing to love your nation and ... you know I I feel more for my nation than I Do for another nation just as I feel more from my family and a number of family\n\nAnd I want other nations to love their nation right all of which I upset very often myself so listen to some of the\nAh some of the letters that are written and again I'll give you updates are with regard to um anything in Florida here with the suspect the bombing so here number one ...\nThe times picks may have times picks there were three are\nThere are three a list that's the word three lists of comments to New York times pick list the readers pick list and all so this is the times pick that sounds like\nPatriotism to me and there's a difference nationalism is historically been used to to know the superiority of the nation to the detriment of other nations in the world community nationalism as arrogance and false pride\nSo I Am about this this has nothing to do with the bobber I Want to ask a question about Megan Kelly so I keep reading how she's a racist and she's a racist and she's a racist and she may be right either I don't know her I I don't particularly care for her but I Do have a great care for troops\nSo the uh one of the big examples biggest constant examples is that she said that Santa Claus is white\nNow let me say for the record that I Love seeing black Santa clauses and Asian Santa Claus is I Love it I think it's I think that is truly the spirit of Christmas\nTo see a the idea of that Santa Claus can only be wiped out would be that would be racist I think [noise]\nBut eve Santa Claus the ... the legend of Santa Claus\nComing from Europe and coming and and the you know for kids another disease from the north pole the people in the north well I guess really north I guess you might be more of a number of me think of it a an Eskimo but anyway it's an ...\nIt's an odd that charge is that if if if you hang your hat on she said Santa Claus is white\nUh [noise]\nUh it doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks that blacks should be mistreated\nOr that they are inherently inferior in some way I Would tell me I'm very I really am curious because I'm not I'm not up on my triggers here\nNow that's an interesting thing just said to me by Sean so this is joy bay are dressed as a a beautiful\nAfrican woman for Halloween this is from twenty six team\nBut like I I don't know the rules are very complex I got to tell you as you know\nThe University of California has a big list of micro aggressions thing that you can things you can say the facts\nReveal that you're a racist I mean you are racist if you say you you don't do the only race you think exist to the human race\nThat actually that actually matter one or the other thing I think you've run gravy thank you for working hard\nAnd moves me it ... me that the shoulders working that hard [noise] All right anyway any any more news on all of that or I Will I Will bring attention won a Prager seven seven six or our lines at work at an age everybody a check on the line some\nWere good All right [noise] but I I Will get back because\nYou have no idea how revealing it is [noise] how much the word nationalism\nRankles people on the left [noise] and you know this is not theoretical stuff\nIf you don't believe in nationalism why stop the caravan\nThere's no nation in your ... your is it\nFor you to protect them as you as your nation correct\nMine Dennis Prager than a Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studios [noise]\nAnd you don't want your lawn nine limousine to\n[noise] here's\nNine sixteen\nNBC News is fifty six year old Florida residents Caesar say a few years the suspect arrested in connection with the wave of pipe bomb packages he has a\nFlorida address with ties to New York President Trump talking about that arrested in connection through the mail packages Trump said the mail bomb suspect will be prosecuted\nI've instructed authorities to spare no resource or expense and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain gesture southern also spoke about the broader issues at play much never allow political violence to take in America cannot let her out of town\nAnd I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop
