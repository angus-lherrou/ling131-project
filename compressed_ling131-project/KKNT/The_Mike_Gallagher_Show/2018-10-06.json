{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "That you can touch and feel for it now to many years down the road that's inflation adjusted so that you're not going to drift Nick Nichols by selling off stocks at a low\nIf you need more income or bonds when they've lost value okay so you need an income land that's one of the things that new advisor your existing advisors should be laying out without cash flow in retirement you don't have a retirement plan\nTaxes oh my goodness here we go Gen hold on tonight\nBecause taxes are the red headed stepchild [laughter] yeah okay I just I Would say that Ninety percent of the people maybe Ninety five percent of the people that I Need to they have most of their money in retirement account account or they have been that they've put away the money for paying taxes on it\nThey are going to pay the taxes later on certainly at seven and a half Uncle Sam\nSays you must start taking us to require minimum distribution you must start taking money from this account and you've\nGot to pay taxes when that happens if you do not have a tax strategy if you do not have a plan that takes into\nAccount how much you're going to be required to take out and how much Uncle Sam is going to be getting from you if you if you're married and you don't take into account how much more you're surviving spouse will have to pay in taxes and drip Nichols give back to the government you do not have a retirement plan so in that\nVery first meeting or or even if you have an existing advise if there's not a forward looking tax strategy that's coordinated with your investment strategy if there is not\nSomething if you do if you're not being shown like the software that we have how much it's going to cost you in tax dollars on this retirement account you're dripping Nichols you're going to be backed into a corner more than likely people are styled it\nWhen I showed them hey here's a million bucks that you have I made the statement usually if someone comes in with a million dollars and they're proud of it I hate to be like this but you know this is not all your money Uncle Sam going to take some\n... and they look at me like yeah okay what part of the retired fit analysis is based upon their age and their life expectancy and how much they have in that retirement account and what their tax bracket is how much they expect to make on their investments we\nDo an actual factual verifiable analysis that shows them how much they're going to give up on that thousand dollars how much is going to cost them and taxes I open ...\nI'm sure it is by opening because we hear taxes and we think oh I'm sure it's something that we don't realize just how big of an impact it can have a ... is that pretty common huge sometimes\nShow people that over the lifetime and the next generation when the money's left behind that they're going to lose over fifty percent now\nThose are my county but not everybody but we take their real numbers their tax bracket and we show them and we showed them with the numbers came from that's putting you in charge that your advisor should be doing that because taxes in retirement you get to control where you take your money from when the fuel denies it right\nOkay big area where we see last opportunity and I'm going to scream about it I can help it\nWith the tax laws right now the taxes are lower for just about everybody a great planning opportunity to really radical ties with your retirement accounts and take some of your money and moving from for ever tax to never taxed OK ed slot\nBy mental it would be very proud of me for saying that that's his line and I and I coined it right and I use it all the time [noise] great opportunity right now with taxes\nLower for most people don't lose the opportunity so if someone's not talking to you whether you're existing advisor or someone you go to see if they're just talking about performance or tools instead of what your goals are\nInstead of taxes being part of that overall plan you'd probably want to think otherwise you need a tax strategy market risk market risk this huge I mean\nLast opportunity there if you're trying to use the wrong tool for their own purpose if you need income tomorrow and you're putting it in an aggressive stock at all of a sudden the market goes down ... you're going to sell off assets you're never going to get\nBack so how do you know if you have too much market risk if\nThere dripping Nick Nichols potentially let us do a probability of success based upon your goals let us take all of this money and and put it into a software based upon your income need your goals your taxes the whole gambit\nLet us put it into this ... that we run thousand different simulations and let me tell you the probability of success or lost the right advisor for this stage of life is going to\nWant to do that for you before they ever expect you to become a client or ever expect you to start making any decisions you won't ... Nichols if you know your probability of success for where you want to go where you are right now really really really cool and really important that the retired fit in Alice this is going to\nTo put you in a position to be proactive about your retirement not reactive and how is that done\nBy really assessing your goals really assessing where you are right now are you drip and that goes with the mutual fund or your investments through you know all the fees so that you're sure you're getting enough bang for your buck [laughter] do you have the appropriate amount of risk for what you're trying to accomplish\nDo you have an income plan that's inflation adjusted do you have a tax efficient strategy I not just making money performance giving it back to Uncle Sam on the other hand\nI Am making the right decisions when it comes to Social Security so that you're wearing out every dollar and cents on that it could have a health care strategy\nThat's what they retire fit analysis is all about and it should be written ... should be able to refer to this you know after the fact of meeting with the advisor or your potential that Pfizer I got really excited they didn't I\nI I always know that Pakistan that going to a\nGame where do they hate me up because I see people losing money all the time because they had a great returned last year they made ten percent they're really excited but guess what eventually they're going to give that\nBack to Uncle Sam ...\nBut the retired fit analysis we'll show you all of this where are you in relationships with real numbers so that you can make well informed decisions about where you want to go and whether there are any gaps but you need to be one of the first ten calls to pick up the phone and call us\nDoesn't the heavy lifting saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for retirement and call us at\nSixty three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again that number six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety ...\n... it's founder and president at the SPN associates\nI'm generally jak alongside retire with the SP dot com it's a website if you'd like to learn a little bit more\nSo than all of a sudden they ask you if we are doing some research here we've been taking notes on the kinds of questions to be asking it tell me what kind of quality we should be looking for to help out with that decision of who should be helping us with our retirement plan\nWell number one you want someone who really what area do they focus on a they somebody who focuses on all things to all people there the accumulation specialist someone in the morning they're going to help you double or triple your money in\nThe afternoon and going to build a a plan for someone who's about to retirement what's their area specialty and and then once you once you dig into that once you know what their area specialty is\nYou want to know you know how long they've been doing it how long have they been doing it and how did\nThey handle clients' money you know when the market went down uh with\nThe tech wreck holiday it I had a really good question the other day someone came in to me and he was ... two days ago [laughter] anyway yeah asked me\nYou know with with the upcoming midterms what if things change get really shaken up and and there's a lot of people they thought that the market would probably go down what would be my plan for that what would be how would I be proactive instead of reactive what was planning to do\nWell he had a long discussion about how we build our plans and how that thought process always has to be that we always have a plan you want to you want to know that this person he sleeps in drink this stage of your life that they have a proactive plan not just reacted\nAnd they're thinking that through he wanted to know that they've been through up and down markets and at that they've had a strategy that that worked and gotten people to through retirement success so you want to know that they're completely license\nAnd not just you know not just on the insurance side or the investment side but but all sides you want to know that they're held to\nThe highest level of accountability okay meaning that they're ... they just don't have to do it suitable for you but they have to do what what is in your best interest they're held to that level\nThat standard that has to be so you want to check out their designations I mean they're they're licensing\nStructure you want to make sure that they don't work for just one company where they have with it kept us they only have ten investment tools that they can offer or insurance products that they can offer\nKnow and I'm Wondering I'm finding too is if you're working with younger clients what I'm Talking about say the late thirties into the forties and they they may not think about these kinds of things and it's it's good that you\nMake sure that they are aware no matter as you said coach whatever their financial situation is right now right they can augment that by doing the right things with your advice\nYeah yeah absolutely right and so and then that knowing that you can retire when you want maybe don't want to retire I'm not I'm not planning on every time but I Know\nOne of the folks that are that we serve and we talked to they could retire whenever they want to and part of the reason is we go through that second opinion survey with them we look at where they are right now we look at what their advisors tell them\nWhat can I talk about a doozy of a national from what they were telling their folks will get to talk about that later on the show but what their advisors telling him and if that's really true or\nNot you know what to what I find culture and Marty is a ... the people of my generation and I'm In my mid sixties uh don't really want to retire just to amplify what you're talking about here we want to go as long as we can earn that sixties generation you know or we think we're invincible and as long as we keep our health\nThat's what the end you know we're valuable members of the workings society today a visa v the young kids today who you're having trouble getting to get jobs even summer jobs have nothing against the millennials but I'll tell you right now this generation is not afraid to work and they we don't want to quit working as long as we have all their faculties\nWell you know if you've ever left the company you may be gone somewhere else and then you go back to visit the old company is not the same anymore is it right now are you retired same thanks a lot of people want to want to seem\nLike they're still useful in and needed and so if you retire they replace you [laughter] and then you go back and you know they they don't want to see you anymore that happens all the time we see it and so\nIt's a mental state it's not just it's not a physical thing a lot of time it's a mental thing and unfortunately we seen stories of people retiring today and a couple of years later they're basically uh you know they're not doing much anymore and they're not happy\nYou know they go stir crazy and only play so much golfer tennis her so many trips you can take and that's all well and good because that's what your plans are all about fried pairing people for all of these the eventuality that all those wants yeah because you can afford it but you know what are your time as valuable to and if you feel like you're wasting you get down get depressed and it's not good\nIt's not only have a plan and that's what we talk about on the show it cuts draws that home each and every week is the personalized plant right every single plane that we put together is personalized to that individual no cookie cutter approach and that is what is absolutely crucial\nOr you can anyone can get a suit but they need a custom tailored for a suit I got it was a neighbor because I didn't have one and my parents didn't have enough money back there so that was one of three boys dad was a college professor mom was basically a housewife and so\n... have never been paid that much in debt and back then you know as a kid we didn't realize how much my parents went without to make sure my my brothers and I we had something except the soup [laughter]\nLike Emma Kelly at my high school graduation al\n... was nice enough my neighbors we have three boys next door and then one of them was about the same size as mean as it does is it about ...\nAnd he had a quarter white suit he didn't want to stay for a quarter always soccer that's what they're saying well this was this was worse than it was Nineteen eighty two and a quarter I assume that we asked off the stage and are\nWe talking about that person was approached after I Walk into a store for a dress shirt and ask for an Eighteen forty one sleeve so yeah it's like what happened what kind of looks you get when you hear that\nSo I sort of say Marty was not a horse racing\n... you know I wouldn't want to leave a well I'm thirty two thirty three and I think that's a\nAlmost too long sometimes I typically get their response was I don't I'm not sure that exists [laughter] yeah so they can do like cut one sleeve off its that'll actually affect the soup that used to have a little patches on the elbow they pay you were going to put your elbows at a table which I Do anyway I was trying to get into your mommy ever\nComes to your right Marty custom tailored fitting a planet if you're listening right now when you want to get accustomed plan\nYou want your four one K. analyzed smarter the big problem with four one K. is a lot of people were participating\nThey're putting money in every paycheck but they really don't know what allocation of sweat 'cause they don't know if this election is they have a good and they don't know the hidden fees that exist in there and by the way folks are a lot of hidden fees and a four one K. or they wouldn't be pushes or we can analyze that for you get you right on track and go according to go through a Quarterly Review process with your selections\nAnd then make sure that when it comes time to make sure that four one K. now turns into a tree retirement plan that income we can help you with that as well but the first step is to get a financial and retirement review looking at the road you're on right now the path you're going down and we take a GPS satellite view making sure that the road you're on right now will get you to the true destination you think you're going to\nAnd you'd be amazed how many people are way off course\nAnd they beat every year with their visor divider tells them everything's fine Marty why do they tell them that\nThey want to see that money a place that that's why we stress the folks who come in and get out of malice just until we put an Eighteen page report together\nAnd it is the best of luck in opinion that you ever did on your investment account we look at fees we looked at expenses and we look at risk adjusted return Jeff are my returns where they should be commensurate with amount of risk that I'm taking which is crucial and that's what we call it the personalized plant\nSo we take those Eighteen pages and we consolidate I'm right down to one page financial review and if your radio listener right now and you have at least four hundred thousand dollar save for retirement\nThis review will be for you or strategies do work best for those of you with over a million dollars\nBut as long as you have all these four hundred thousand or so safe retirement and in four one K. is or not you're home you're home you're not going to sell your home and live in the streets every time about anything but real estate like that is in court right now if you have rental real estate that can be included in that because a lot of times when people get older they want to transition out of the real estate and into a safe investment that will grow\nIt'll give them protection and it'll give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd if you have rental real estate it all depends you only get income if someone's paying your rent and Iraq so we'll we'll put all that together for you if you're one of the next twenty dollars right now and Marty the most important thing is they'll have their own customized income plant folks you have your own income plan if you call right now that you'll be confident in and it'll be true again it'll have gross\nIncome protection all built in is a triple play the positive triple play in the financial world but what Marty talked about the most important part of this whole Eighteen page plan\nIs we give your own personal lives and customize calculated risk exposure level as it currently exist now based on the risk you're taking right now in the market what would happen if it went the wrong way what would it do to your portfolio and if the market keeps going up what would be on the positive side so we'll wait a positive worse than negatives the secret and retirement is to get that curve down\nSo if the market goes down you don't lose much if any of your retirement money now there's nothing wrong with taking risk but don't do it with money you're going to need\nAll the way through retirement we can show your own calculated risk exposure level as well as your very own income plan which we call turning a financial plan into a true\nRetirement plan no cost her obligation\nWe seen others offer this for over a thousand dollars or more yeah you know we could charge about two hundred dollars an hour for this but we're going to have it as a radio is it or if you call right now you meet with me Marty Parker and the team will put together a plan for you that you can be confident that will take you all the way through retirement\nYou know the first step really is to sit down with the financial coach if something that we are talking about on the show say resonates with you and you feel the need to just get that second opinion or if you want to make sure your plan really is a line with your goals and a very important to risk tolerance that we talk about\nJust call in and Scott bird our local trusted coach serving the Phoenix community can translate for you that complex financial world that's a very clear instructions take advantage of this true\nPractical retirement review all you have to do is call us

new movie with Rudy Rudy girl sure that you remember the movie Rudy Rudy more movies of all time twenty five years ago it came out now there'll be releasing it to studios here in the in the fall\nBut we went to Notre Dame being a good group of producers and directors and walked the campus with the real rooting not the not shown Ashton the actor we film that last year last April and Notre Dame so about a year and a half ago and\nNow our movie is out it's called Rudy rooted you're the walk on and it's a full length motion picture and it's available right now on Amazon Prime\nView on right means at all you know I just want to ask you one question how many yards and how many carries those you happy and I'm over\n... you remember watching that movie if you haven't watched I watched the original one could ugly nothing about twenty five times and I'll admit I cried each time I watch it and great about a little guy overcoming adversity Rudy smaller than I Am and he was playing football at Notre Dame money like a dream come true yeah so uh\nWe walked around campus in all the places you saw in the movie we went to and then and people recognize some people still recognize Rudy there and I'm over ... movie ...\n... again and then the state mhm yeah I was shooting specialist there some other some of its famous people in there too but it's a really good movie about overcoming adversity and and and not letting people tell you can't be done it's a little engine that could kind of thing and so rude is a real good guy\nReally excited about the movie and\nAnyway that's that's good news and then the other good news and I've been invited to be in a another movie coming up here in two thousand Nineteen it'll be out is called the last blockbuster\nPoet rarely tell me the number of limits the\nLast ... member blockbuster I Do I mean you can\nJust eat it up slowly I remember going to blockbuster and then you spend a lot of time perusing all the videos you can always find one you want you go up to the\nFront desk and they say they're all sold out there all your begging me almost want to give them five dollars to make money but I think a swimmer five to go look into your return box always about turning videos like check it out here so please be kind rewind member that old guy yeah\nSo that last blockbuster you guys are probably you guys probably her be talking about where there were three of 'em a couple of years ago two of them in Alaska they're both gone OK so give us a hit us this east or west of the Mississippi ...\nThe separatists or is it in Vegas no it's in Bend Oregon I never get that no so uh I don't know why\nA lot of retirees there has got a lot of time on their hands don't use digital\nGot you know they had a chance to buy Netflix for pennies and they passed up on it [laughter]\nLike chicken yourself into a yeah so that's really fun that will be talking about that but it's just going to be fun I'm going to work there for\nA day at school I met yeah very cool and then they're going to interview the quote unquote working there and er about my experiences with blockbuster in the past you know I think more with blockbuster all the time was when you returned to tape\nWhen you go up to their box out there you throw it in the box we had no yeah no proof that you put the take back in the bud right right yeah I Know with all their mailbox kind of thing you'd you know drive up and throw it in there and then\nIt's up to them to say you really turned back in if not sort of like uh you ever had never library books back into the check a book out and they have to do overdue by him maybe forgot to turn it back in all summer so they they sent you a bill for like fifty dollars typically costs twenty [laughter] so that's what they did with his videotapes too if if you didn't turn it back in a lot of money yeah\nAnd there was no recourse I mean you know oil yeah no way of ... so it was it was a he said she said for me I found that it was after we had to be very careful on that so anyway that I thought I'd share that because we're we're positive about\nThe movies and I've won a couple of these before because of you and why do people out there like Peter de ... one of the three guys behind space six and everyone's heard of Richard Branson and must cars but Peter demonic says the brains I think behind the operation and and so that one too and he's a couple years ago called the vision ear\nAnd he'll look around that society these days is always somebody trying to do something to make things better\nAnd then there's always someone trying to do things worse or something about the bank they're charging those fees on people so\nBut they're not getting you through retirement and so people always ask me and I know Marty shows where they to coach what age should we start planning for retirement me I always say at the beginning of your working career but if you've been putting it off is fifty two is the absolute deadline\nTo start planning for retirement now if you're fifty seven if you're sixty three and you have started planting it don't despair\nBut if you're fifty one it's a good time to throw your sleeves up if you're anywhere in your fifties even sixties\nLet's diagram out let's go get a complete map about what you've been doing where you are right now and where you want to be and let's make sure that you are on the proper wrote\nAnd what I used to do I get the free mass from AAA and I will get a highlight around I Would highlight the destination I Want to go to\nThen I look around and make sure that everything was fine there and make sure there's no possible flooding of the roads that that kind of thing we don't want any flooding er or storms that hit our retirement plan\nWe do that for folks member back of the day before they started blowing up the mountains you had to go around them out to get up the mountain and over and over that you go around around around that they are went over the mountain of beer I guess the ... because he didn't go round he went over\nIt I always wondered about I Seventy seven to those two tunnels you go when you're on north or at least seven toward the Cleveland\nTunnels where they actually went through it yeah and so instead of going around things and wasting time let's go through it the shortest distance between two points is what it was great\nSo what Wayne Gretzky just to say you know when you're you're not the fastest skater but you always seem to be where the where the play is that he said I don't I don't I don't skate to where the puck is ice skate to where it's going and so folks we do the same mentality in the financial world but if you want your very own\nTrue retirement plan not a financial plan that's disguised as a like Halloween put a mask on like a disguised as a as a retirement plan to get a true retirement plan that's one that actually has income built in Fort life that is growing right now\nWhen you don't need it is protected when you don't need it and when you need and then it gives you the income for the rest of your wife as a true income plan which turns of financial plan into retirement plan Steve\nIf people are curious about this which I Would be if I was listening and I wasn't sure if you've had one advisor for a long time maybe they don't specialize in what you need to see it would not hurt\nTo interview a couple of other advisors ones that are true for new series I Am an R. I. C. P. retirement income certified professional there aren't many out there to designation three ... exams three big classes over two years\nIt's a destination that specializes in transitions from financial plans to return of plants going from you're working for years to your retirement years and the best time to do it as before you retire\nAt ... to get the plan put in place so if you are with the next ten people call this is a I mean we could charge two hundred fifty dollars or more now are we supposed to do that but we're not we're going to wave that the if you call right now to one of the next ten callers would at least two hundred thousand save retirement\nWe'll put your very own plan together we help you done it by some of his financial termites inside almost every four one K. and show you waste to allocate your funds correctly and if you're fifty nine or over\nYou could transfer some of that money tax free from your four one K. your to your very own individual Iraqi and if you have more than one four one K. or irate we put them together we call that a super IRA\nIt makes retirement planning fun see but I Know that you spent a lot of time this week putting together what we call brokers behaving badly I think I Would like you to play that right now\nYou got it [noise]\nKorean news networks present broker\nToday's episode of brokers behaving badly is really bad\nAnd we learned from the SEC that buys former advisors and three firms they represent are facing multiple charges in Manhattan District corn all standing from a one hundred million dollar Ponzi scheme it's

cruiser that old and I just hate but we I just thought it was it's a Ninety nine in great shape except for a few things that I think of the life of that car\nLike almost a thousand miles I think it

anybody ... on the table scared of the land cruiser now they all work the same you know they all have a compressor with an electric collect so have the drier they all have something to meet her the flow of refrigerant to be perfectly honest with you that would be something that I Would start with your garage that not unless of course you're in the loop shop\nOr a jerk you know you're having your old changes that have transportation shop to now converted to full service auto repair that's a bad idea but never the full service repair shops that that I'm aware of what I Would have no problem but
