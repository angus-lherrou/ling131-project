I Am the cynical but cynical side of me says is this a big story that and is is this happening to take our attention away from the big October surprise of the migrant caravan and the thousands of illegals\nHeaded towards the southern border and it it's just a product of the time we're living in\nSending a bomb to somebody's house\nHas nothing to do with politics and it has nothing to do with your political beliefs or ideology is evil it is awful it is wrong and we should not\nBe even thinking about that kind of political cynicism now it's inevitable because of the time we're living in and it just it just\nKind of frustrates the heck out of me but if what if you have not heard there is a a developing story a that is being reported or regarding a improvised explosive devices being sent to a prominent\nDemocrat freaking now\nMike Gallagher show\nThere are a media reports or a bounding that law enforcement is investigating ... suspicious bomb slight packages being sent to the homes of bill and Hillary Clinton in ...

that's post presidency and of course this coming on the heels of a package of bomb a package brings sent reportedly the home of George Soros who is the billionaire liberal activists\nI'm\nWho funds a lot of anti conservative causes and ah and movements or this is a disturbing story um it is evil it's wrong and it it just has no political story a component to it it just doesn't\nUh and it shouldn't or not at least in the in the uh in the trajectory of saying oh is this something that takes people's attention away from the the caravan of illegals marching towards the United states and has no one has nothing to do with the other\nAnd I don't believe for one minute that somebody is sending bombs to prominent Democrats\nAs a way to divert people's attention away from real issues\nNo one's going

showing the relief factor dot com studios Mr Speaker I never thought I'd get inspired by the Washington Post but I I've interviewed Dan Balz a number of times over\nThe years of various political conventions and debates and all and he wrote a piece this week headlined battleground house district remain close in New pool\nUm he he says that according to a new Washington post poll of the most contested districts in the country\nThe Democrats now hold a statistically insignificant lead over Republicans again it's not supposed to happen that way\nThere's this was supposed to be occurring new to the ... or do we dare dream that the narrative that the Democrats are going to take the house but Republicans are going to control continue to control the Senate\nIs not going to happen and that Republicans have a chance of holding both chambers\nAnd look at it I think social anybody who tells you they know what's going to happen to show that two weeks out of everybody all she knew that Donald Trump would lose on election day uh five thirty eight the the uh\nNew York times found the polling operation said there was a Seventy one percent like illegal wins um but you know virtually no one of the United states but some cry but I said for a long time I thought he could win and but but I think as far out\nA dynamic developing we'll see how the dynamic continuous but but for the last few each part of the written about this in my newsletters again which productions um the uh\nThe Kavanaugh fact been treated for things one\nCan galvanize the concert issue really angry at that sort of sleepwalking and happy and lots of good things but now they're angry and that's a huge increase\nIn energy on the right which I she personally I'm sure you see that throughout is you're going to do it may seem like much more energy than I can remember it any time in many many years a second\nI'm mask came off so\nI take the nastiness deliciousness Spartacus moment my book or a the the the shouting over the chairman of the Democratic senator from California Kamala Harris down the list Harris having\nPeople be under you know the degree to which they are willing to exploit Dr Ford nippy later keep her letter hidden spraying it at the last minute maximize public relations um people get a sense that you know these people are really bad\nAnd I think that the the mass continue to come off and you see more and more bad state mentioned more and more bad comments on the third thing that happened was all of a sudden particularly the center racist\nPeople realized oh yeah this is a team sports and so somebody like bite us and we would have been desperately trying to convince people in Tennessee the news that moderate they looked up and they said wait a second you're going to vote for Schumer\nWhile you're in a moderate pressure on the latest polls are just came out this week show high camp for example down sixteen points\nNow nobody when she's a very very competent a political figure she's very good campaigner for very long track record in North Dakota nobody would have guessed that she'd be down sixteen points\nAnd everywhere you turn now racist that the Democrats thought they were going to win a very very tight um you know early voting washing of the Republicans are doing very well know again I don't I don't want to draw any conclusions and we still have almost two weeks\nAnd two weeks out I think Donald Trump would have lost\nBut he was gaining votes every single day right than if we keep gaining boats every single day and frankly a caravan as it is a is a huge burden for the Democrats that they just can't I think the answer to that and I think among suburban a woman\nWho have been one of the real weaknesses for Trump as they think about him is Thirteen gangs and they think about cartels and they think about a lawlessness\nAnd seven thousand people determined to break the law I think they need Democrats and come back to the Republicans are in a much greater number then people would have just a month ago I was\nJust me or does it feel you you're talking about prominent Democrats and the missteps of the last month or so I mean ... and you could go to Elizabeth Warren and her bizarre\nA decision to release this DNA test and create a whole wave of of ridicule and scorn\nOr the mob violence we're seeing we're seeing a Heidi Heitkamp I mean for crying out loud she she tells the world she was ready to vote yes on Kavanaugh until she watched his testimony with the sound turned off\nAnd she didn't like his facial expressions doesn't it feel like the Democrats are a bit like the gang which that couldn't shoot straight\nI think they have a huge problem I think their their base so far less now\nAnd the energy at their base and the hatred that there'll be says Trump is showing chance yeah they're surrounded all day by people who are giving them signals uh that don't work in the normal world for it and so on you know comments like em I'm sure that that one that former attorney general said when the Republicans you're down\nA little low we kick kick him I'm sure in that immediate crowd they liked it\nBut for the rest of the country it was a little sobering somebody has been the chief law enforcement officer United States\nSuggesting that Republicans ought to get checked threat and it comes to comes in the middle of the whole wave of these kind of say ... ... and the other the other part of it is frankly a generation of left wing activist to get goofy things and said do the things who are now running for office\nAnd we

at a breakneck pace is he still might show\nWe're not going to make America great again was never that\nWe've got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ... since Nineteen Seventy eight Mike Gallagher as voice of clarity for millions of Americans\nThose\nFunny if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house and the words that are\nShown on the most famous man on the planet even\nGrade Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly now\nFrom the relief factor dot com studio Mike\n[noise] we are in the middle of an incredible time [noise] the president tweeted today [noise] a very big part of the anger we\nSee today is our society is caused by the purposely falls in an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description\nMainstream media must clean up its act fast well the mainstream media doubles down and says this is all his fault these pipe bombs at least suspicious packages that have been sent to prominent Democrat critics of President Trump um we've had a voice of reason in this country lately\nUh last night you know in a room of about a thousand people in Irving, Texas\nRight outside Dallas we had a an event on stage where Sean Spicer my colleagues Larry Elder Dennis Prager Mark Davis and I were talking about all of these important volatile issues\nAnd I mentioned the name Senator Lindsey Graham at a roar went up\nThe lecture which I haven't heard in a long time I know he's feeling the love about everywhere he goes because many of us believe that we're not for Lindsey Graham's passion\nAnd his heart felt anguish over the way the process of judge Kavanaugh played out he wouldn't be justice justice Kavanaugh today what a what a joy is to bring back to the Mike allergies show Senator Lindsey Graham from the Palmetto State of South Carolina Senator Graham what a time to be alive ha\nI'm trying to make the guy that won the lottery I don't know who he is but I'm trying to find it\nBut he's in your state right I mean listen can I all I Need ten million a year and it made him you get five I'll take I could do five or seven and you know and we'll be All right [laughter]\nYou know ... or try to get more on and I get one so that they're getting no kidding\nI write he'd get fringe groups he'd get three groups and you get one of ice cream and Senator Graham honestly do his last last night I mean here we are in Dallas texas and here's hundreds and hundreds of people roaring their approval for just for your name were so appreciative of your voice and and I I just got to get the Lindsey Graham\nThirty five thousand feet view of of what the all the time we're living in this investigation is intensifying these suspicious packages CNN's Jeff Zucker immediately blamed President Trump what is what a Senator Lindsey Graham say about the last twenty four hours of this very nervous a dangerous time\nWhere you take your frustrations out at the ballot box to support your team their support you're causing appropriately I don't blame President Trump put say more than a blank Bernie for the guy that shot state Scalia and tried to kill a bunch of Congress then\nRuns a Bernie supporter but Bernie doesn't support that or this person is obviously sending bombs that critics at the press that\nThat's not the way we do business in America hope they get caught\nI Hope they go to jail and open about Thirteen Days republic when at the ballot box because we deserve to get reelected\nAnd that's the answer the only answer we have we got to be the the the we got to have a big boy pants on we can't Flay all around and and point fingers of blame the wrong time to do this because frankly Senator Graham seems very clear Republicans have a great deal of momentum heading into November ...\n[laughter] no question about it I'm so Kevin I think what people were trying to say to you and to myself when I made them ... thank you for speaking a thank you for speaking in a in a fashion that if I were there I Would have said the same thing\nLess than what they were kind of data Brett Kavanaugh who I've known for Twenty years is just Korea's life to keep the seat open to make sure the Democrat could fill it in twenty twenty they actually said that\nThey play dirty and they lost I'm Glad I called him out I had all I could take at thirty percent of mind Kagan not because I chose them but that was I thought they were qualified Thurmond butter pecan spurts or Holland Saudi approach Scalia to people from South Carolina the game's played differently now\nAnd what they were trying to do to protect Kevin I Hope it I Hope there's a backlash at the ballot box and I hope we pick up seats and they get punished for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little personal you cause of known for a long time and I have respect for you at all and you know that all the years that that I've been on the radio I said Senator Lindsey Graham is a good and decent man I met you in Washington DC\nEarly in my talk radio career you told me something that stuck with but you said Mike I came to Washington not to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things across the finish line\nThere is a belief and I and I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings are a big because I respected admire you and I knew for a long time there's a belief that with your friendship with the late Senator McCain\nYou were sort of restrained a little bit and with his passing his like Lindsey unleashed its Lindsey Graham the way South Carolina south Carolinians have known him for many many years he was there any merit to that Senator Graham\nNow people are thinking way too hard ah here's the deal\nOr if you know anything about may have tried to be a supporter of an independent judiciary our energy needs to be independent of politics John McCain was my dear friend he voted against ... cameras heart asked when it came to judge it to the bottom line as\nI could never done to set of mind Kagan what they were doing to Brett Kavanaugh they were misrepresenting his life\nThey trade dot the Ford and there's no doubt in my mind something happened to the airport but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it or they tried to ruin his family\nAnd they said if you're really innocent or not you asked for this charade continue and that's when I lost it as fun Durban\nAsk Kevin out attorney Don McGahn the White House counsel if he really had nothing to hide wanted to ask for this to continue they present him guilty not innocent everything that I Believe in as a warrior um was was basically trampled on\nAnd I pushed back and it's no more complicated than that\nWell we're ... on a nation is grateful for you and your push back many believe I mean as it is it an overreach to say that that that that your voice your speech your passion helped the confirmation occur\nWell here's what I Would say number one I Want to congratulate President Trump for picking Brett Kavanaugh who's the great lakes in mind that this generation his resume and being a judge was unquestioned is integrity he's just a great guy I think what happened\nIs that I gave voice to those on our side who said enough already rancid always are judges Mike why is it always Clarence Thomas and pork and Alito and now the cabinet why is it to our people right and they wanna\nThey wanna went too badly over there playing pretty if the Republican that dentist a male democratic nominee will be crucified\nOh we'd be it wouldn't be a ...\nFor these people can you imagine if it's a democratic male nominee a lady from South Carolina dumps demand gives me a letter and I sit on it never shared with it the\nCommittee that day to me a car recommended a conservative lawyer never told the lady from South Carolina oh by the way the Democrats will come here to meet you [noise] that'd be a riot in the street or without the press so so I just got mad I was pissed\nI Know you were and more I like about it that get tests to get so hopefully with [laughter] well we hope\nHe's ... he is justice Kevin I mean that battle was more and and and he's on the Supreme Court and maybe there'll be another conservative on the Supreme Court ah in in over the next few years Senator Lindsey Graham is with us let me ask you about the
