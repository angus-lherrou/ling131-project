vitamin C.\nVitamin C. All right well uh vitamin C is is not really new though\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal health and unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends\nAnd the bottom line is with out enough signed them and see and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies\nDiabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be short and by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contains about sixty five milligrams of vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three or four thousand yeah and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice\nSo because of lack of vitamin C. they were getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well\nThe number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just don't any energy I don't feel like myself\nI'm hurting yup and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we've got to do these tasks sending through the scanner and the problem is is they don't find anything mhm it's the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd what's interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. All right and the other ones that aren't any pigs primates and the fruit bat\nWhen you look at the rest of the animals out there you don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure\nYou don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. huh and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nMilk produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy but first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it you know right\nBut you know I think most people myself included sinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is that\nKnow what it is actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amount and the right kind and that's why I created\nMy supersede twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down to have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has to twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... your body needs different forms of it\nAnd I put it all into one vitamin formula now and you said there was how much vitamin C. and your super see twenty to foreigners Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what what are some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're going to experience as energy vitamin C. producing energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is it okay if I read an email to sure for sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay now listen to this after three days of being on super see his blood pressure dropped\nIt he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days he said now another thing that happened is I became more alert and I now have a clear head off and vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nI Want to let your listeners know that if you want to get a free book about vitamin C.

to the supermarket before I got here [laughter]\nOkay and I brought some vitamin C. and I I went and bought these and\nI'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in it so it right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well just one type of ... right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it

I Know I Am I'm you know Dr brings with all of this emerging information that's out there why do you think we're not hearing more about the benefits of vitamin C.\nIt's not a sexy trend but vitamin C. has survived the test of time because it's been around it was discovered it in the Nineteen thirties ... vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies in fact one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years\nWell who who should I mean is there a perfect candidate that you can describe that that should be like it's a no brainer beyond your super see twenty\nTwo formula well yes I Would say first of all if you're listening out there and you're over the age of sixty\nIt's a no brainer there you you absolutely need to get on my supersede formula because you manifest symptoms more readily than younger people mhm for those of you who are younger and your child bearing years vitamin C is necessary for you and your baby and those of you and your forties and fifties\nThese are the ages that I call your insurance age vitamin C is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself ... so he had on it even if you're not manifesting symptoms get on it and stay on it okay and for those of you who have teenagers or young children I started my son very very young on super see\nAnd I can tell you I can count on one hand the number of times he's been sick through a childhood and teen years so when I say it's super see it is super see it's a great formula\nAnd by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that you'll experience\nWell the first thing you're going to experience this energy and along with that comes mental clarity less pain better vital signs like blood pressure starts to go down you'll see that your cholesterol is improving your HDL the good cholesterol goes up and running with her I'd go down the inflammatory markers and your blood start to go down\nYou know Chris we're talking about healthier right\nWell and unfortunately Dr putting us we are about out of time here at any anything else you want to share with the with our listeners today that Chris first I Want to thank you again for having me on your oh it's always a great fun especially when it's a surprise like this\nAnd for those of you listening I Want to let you know that I really believe there is no accidents I think we're all here together for a reason and I want to let you know that health is a two way partnership even with my patients I'm there to help as much as I can\nNow with my super see twenty two I've done the work but you have to take the next step so I urge you to call in order to my formula get on it give it to your family and see for yourself how it\nRoof with the right weight plan and with demand management because many of these rape plans that you can only be on with solar if you do not manager demand that adjuster\nThat's charging you very very highly a ... a very ... much higher charge for your power between three and eight PM abs\nAnd ... one ... one does a one to eight and three to six if you don't manage your demand you could end up having\nStill a very high bill connected to the electric company\nSo this is why I say to people I use the analogy\nThere is lots of companies out there that can make hamburgers there is only one that has the secret sauce I Am not trying to throw anybody under the bus I'm not trying to say anything bad about any other company I'm just saying make sure when you're going to consider P. Y. O. P.\nThat you're working with somebody who cares just like I cared about my daughter\nAnd my grandkids home to make sure it was done correctly because in my experience there's a lot of solar sales people out there and I'm not one of them I'm not a soldier sales person I'm a mom and grandma and retired nurse that figured out that this was a very good solution for my own daughter and my own family\nAt reducing the cost of their power which they would continue to need\nFor for for as long as they're in the house so basically they're going to be paying a power bill or power cost\nEvery month every year for decades to come\nAnd that's what we're all faced with so the only way to get away from what's going on with that's affecting our power companies pay the electric companies want to charge more for the same power they sold us last year and now politics getting involved in it and there's these prop one twenty sevens and God only knows what else is coming down the pike\nIs produced your own\nPower and you're going to pay less for between seven and half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt the average hopeful Jeremy if they just use the average amount of electricity over the next Twenty years with a very conservative number three percent increases over the next Twenty years a pie as we've seen increases a far greater\nThan twenty percent this year so I'm being very conservative when I say these increases we don't know what they will be a year after year after year and they keep sending out email or messages and advertisement you know little jingles like oh be energy efficient whatever the only way to be\nEnergy efficient and be able to afford to live comfortably in your home is go out of the house\nDuring the daytime and go to the mall or go to the movie theater which is absolutely ridiculous you've worked so hard\nTo live comfortably in your home that you for your family your retirement et cetera and these power companies that are dictating to us how much power we can use\nAnd how ... it is it or I'm a ... a unaffordable that is when we use it it's absolutely atrocious so\nThe way that you get you get ahead of this and you don't have to worry about this any more\nIs go to my website um German is going to get that out call me I'm again you pay ... we we can we can all collectively go down and rant and rave\nAt at group meetings and try and be heard in front of the Arizona corporation mission I just talked to somebody this week that he was on the ballot he didn't meet the primary he is a great guy great Christian man\nHow they don't want to get people on the Arizona ... I'm Sorry I'm I'm not saying that everybody tore up on the Arizona corporation your mission but I'm telling you I've heard more of a good people that have not gotten on to the Arizona corporation mission because\nI think it's the old boys' network so again so you don't let these things affect your family your household budget\nGo to my website filled out the killer worksheet and keeps telling me how much power you used how badly how's your bill increased um in two thousand Eighteen from two thousand Seventeen and let's get you're producing your own power paying less for it and so these things won't ever affect your family and your muscles budget ever again\nYeah I heard some people talk about how easy it is and you're right you just go to the website asks solar Sandy dot com that ask solar Sandy dot com or you can call six to three\nEight five zero eighty two twenty nine one more time six to three eight zero\nEighty two twenty ninth and sometimes you'll hear a say don't fall for the fake people these are why we get bad stories everybody who works with us we know they're going to have great outcomes so we want you to get the real deal that's where you go to ask\nSolar Sandy dot com ask solar Sandy dot com\nKnow it's so funny Jeremy I feel like I'm On a on a roll on on a tangent today but I so I'm so upset about um I at the I've been in homes this summer where people have kept a thermostat at eighty five eighty eight um the next increase or new fee taxes surcharge that they decided to add on somebody's bill\nWhat Ninety Ninety five degrees to the point where people's health\nAnd wellbeing are being compromised because of the greed of these power company\nSo again you know five years ago in my daughter's neighborhood there was only maybe two homes that had solar on it and now there's only two homes that don't so it's really important everyone\nI Know that you probably at some point now are starting to look at oh my gosh are we going to be able to afford our power bills and he'll just sheer some of you haven't even seen the full impact of it your own budget building with a PS you could end up with the federal amount at the end of the year it can be five hundred it could be a thousand dollars\nThis is how deceptive these new rape plans are\nOn a PS recommended rape Humphrey said oh they're very similar to your old rate plan makes sure I'm sure that you're on by may first some people were migrated over be before may first but if you're on the budget billing you may not see the full extent of a PS is\nUm you know impact on your family is hopeful ... families and hopefuls budget\nBecause if you aren't paying the right amount on your budget billing you will have what's called the federal amount at the end of the year if you do not pay that settled them out your power will get shut off so at the end of the year at Christmas or just after Christmas that in your life and bill in December\nOr can you imagine getting a a a setup amount for eight hundred thousand dollars Germany or could there be a worse time right and if you and you know if you don't pay that\nYour power gets ... and if you don't pay on time you get taken off budget building\nSo by producing your own power and so there is a way for me to help my abs families eliminate owing anything to a pass you're going to produce all the power you need for your home your day your nighttime and a little bit extra\nThere was a deadline that I was talking about in previous weeks August thirty first it was the buyback program anybody that worked with me and got in before August thirty first they had a buyback of twelve point nine for any extra power that they didn't consumed during the day they were sending to a PS is great and they were buying it for twelve point nine\nA PS apparently four hundred and eighty eight million dollars isn't enough for them so they're now dropping that\nReview with Arizona corporation commission you think they're going to get the approval of course they are down from twelve point nine eleven points that it has not been an act and yet I cannot guarantee that\nUm even if today you got if I got your application and with a PS you're going to get the whole point nine but yet in before they take the eleven point six cents away from us completely so\nAny extra power you're exporting back to the grid its monetary credit on your bill not a kilowatt hour credit a monetary credit so those killer credits are starting to produce a monetary credit on your bill\nCovers fees taxes and your nighttime power so at the end of the year I have many of my families that are going to have checks back one thousand two thousand maybe even more back at the end of this year so again\nSo you are locked into your own rate of between seven and half and ... cents per kilowatt daytime nighttime that will be you know you're you're you're on ... on the off peak power that you're producing on your roof will be arranged between seven and a half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nIf you go to a passes website and are familiar with those those refunds right now there is no rape plan on a piece as well say or ... either that offers your power on peak or off peak at a guaranteed rate of seven and half the eight and a half cents per kilowatt that lock she wins the next twenty five thirty years\nThat's the only way that you can lock in your own power prices by producing it yourself and not being subject to\nFuture and there's going to be more of them many more of them and things like prop one twenty seven is going to impact our costs a PS\nAs opposed to this the reason they're opposed to this they're up already pencil into their um their operating costs fifty nine hundred megawatts of natural gas plant which there's they're going to make a lot of profit on building the natural gas plants they do not want to\nAdd solar onto their operating costs because at the reduced\nNumber of reduced a profit to them so of course are opposed to it because they've already got the rates are approved over the next X amount of years based on those operating expenses so atheists is opposed to it so but it's just ...\nAnd again I'm not recommending to anybody for it or against it at this point because there's too many changes that are continuing to come down the pike and until I really know what to recommend to people the only thing that I can recommend is the only way that these kinds of things are not going to affect your individual families and helpful\nAffordability and your power costs and living comfortably
