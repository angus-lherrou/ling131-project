I Want to say this because I mentioned it on my fireside chats and I want you to know that I Do fireside chats virtually every week we have about a half million views [noise] it's a lot of use for a fireside chat but I think a lot of people a lot of other people should see it\nI just from my home I talk by a fire side by a fire [noise] talk about life take questions mostly from young people it's it's fun and it's intense and I mentioned and I I admit this that\nI have I ... I didn't verify it yet but the source was told to me was a very very reliable one\nAnd I heard about other cases but again I this is one of the rare times I haven't looked it up but it's so sounds right\nThat even if it's not true it's worth saying because we live in an era where this is exactly what would happen and the the word safe brought this to mind\nThat fourteen year olds are not allowed to trick or treat in certain cities because they don't want anybody older than kids to be with them do you understand that does that make any sense to you\n\nKnow look look at look it up looked at a fourteen year olds yeah not not allowed to trick or treat the point that I'm making is 'cause I'm totally you know what I'm passionate about truth passionate thumb crazed actually\nAnd so I'm telling you what the outset it may not be accurate so why would I tell you something that may not even just\nChesapeake I heard about northern Virginia that's where I was told anyone years yeah All right up on so there you go on an ordinance that bans anyone Thirteen not fourteen Thirteen or older from trick or treating\nOkay so there you go I'm Sorry it's in USA Today okay so there you go I knew I knew the source that told me was reliable that so it's very rare that I report something that I haven't specifically checked almost source but there you go\nSafe\nHey Sean play a better safe than sorry the new it's the ... this is my new and to to the national anthem we had the land of the free and the whole of the brave how does how Americans saw themselves as the land of the free and the whole day but we don't we don't think that way you got to\nOh I'm\nSo sad\nPeople don't understand me of course it's funny it's the reason we player but Larry is when you think about it but it's it's hilarious about a very sad thing\nI I looked into the camera yesterday at the fireside chat and I ... ... but I think what you said the ... ... more than half of those viewing the fireside chats or young people it's ... so almost by definition about at least sixty five percent okay\nAnd I said you know\nWith with with real sadness I got to tell you the America you're growing up in is so different from the America I grow up and and I know people I Know what the left has yeah of course 'cause there's less racially Muslim ... and by the way that right\nThat's correct there is less racism and homophobic agree with that but in in so many other arenas it is so different than a bad way\nThe freedom issue is just spectacular cultural appropriation that's as weird as this as safe as safe spaces why\nIs it bad I don't even understand I understand there are other stuff as bizarre as it may be this one I don't even understand a ... a ... a white Anglo saxon Protestant where's there's some rare on Halloween or for that matter to\nA a a Latino party or ... some of the costume party and that's wrong that's morally wrong\nIs there one person listening but a lot of people listening right now is there one who can explain to me what is wrong I mean it I Want to understand it it doesn't make sense it goes from from my perspective it goes under the rubric of\nCauses or to the left what oxygen is to biological life\nThere there always has to be some fight against something oppressive when I tell students that I I don't think anybody is oppressed in the United states they\nAre not about all students but many students just are so relieved to hear it from an adult they can't believe it I mean it's just like I said I had I said a ... an expletive they would be less shocked\nNobody is oppressed\nIt was a black girl came over and took a picture by the way we're starting to do something to put those pictures up that I'm sending you from young people will just be me at airports and stuff it's fun and I put their first name of it was that all the id them\nAnd oh did you see the picture of the security police security that I had at Colorado State that I sent it to these guys look like they're going to fight the Taliban\nI thought they were the armed forces oh you got to see we got to put it up at these guys were precious but all of these guys thank you by the way to the security folks I it it it ended\nUp thank God I don't think it was necessary but I saw so much hate directed against me that I decided to do that\n\nSo back to back to this issue of Oh yes me so there was a black girl came over to pose a lot of young people came over to get selfies with me which I Love you know [noise] so I stay a lot after a speech and always do that and so she was a black girl wearing a ... right make America great again\nAnd she knew what to parents a Christian who gave the dog ... is a feminine now for God the presence of the shift in one's life\nComes from the Hebrew word as as as everybody here knows but I still say listen I can which is\nThe to reside so what's the residing presence of God they go every body\n[laughter]\nSo this guy I didn't ask or was it
