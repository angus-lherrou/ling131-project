us you better think again the truth is that viruses colds and the flu can strike almost any time of the year which is exactly why you should be doing everything you can to protect yourself no matter what time of year it is\nSo what's the best way to protect yourself from these nasty viruses the colds and the flu will here today to share his health secrets\nFor shielding against viruses colds and the flu is Dr Michael ... is great to see it again Chris it's great to be here you know most of you probably know the doctor and it gives us a nationally recognized authority on both natural and alternative health he's also very successful chiropractor he's been son out by top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes any continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns so Dr biggest what is this health secret that you've been talking about\nWell what the secret is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C.\nVitamin C. All right well uh vitamin C is is not really new though\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell and unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends\nAnd the bottom line is with out enough fight him and see and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies diabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be short and by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contains about sixty five milligrams of vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three or four thousand yeah and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice\nSo because of a lack of vitamin C. they were getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well the number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just saw any energy I don't feel like myself I'm hurting yeah and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go all we've got to do these tasks send you through the scanner\nAnd the problem is is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd it was interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. alright the other ones are any pigs primates\nAnd the fruit bat when you look at the rest of the animals out there you don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure\nYou don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nYeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it\nRight but you know I think most people myself included sinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between\nVitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is that you know what it is actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my supersede twenty two formula\nAnd as a powder Chris in the mix it into water you drink it down to have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmounts of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... your body needs different forms of it and I put it all into one\nVitamin formula now and you said that was how much vitamin C. and your super see Tony to four years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what what are some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're going to experience that energy vitamin C. produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is it okay if I read an email to sure sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped\nIt he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days he said no another thing that happened is I became more alert and I now have a clear head off from vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nDr bank is has been really talking to us about vitamin C. and I'm like most of you I was more under the impression that vitamin C. was instrumental in helping to boost your immune system then all of these other things that we've been talking about a including being able to\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where\nPeople are confused well Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I did go to the supermarket before I got here [laughter]\nOkay and I brought some vitamin C. and I went and bought these and I'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this\nThis particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in it so right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients All right\nThis one has a vitamin C. well just one type of ...\nRight it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... now cellulose has grown up newspaper\nAlright the next one is uh vegetables Derek gases\nNow that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form of\nA and the next one is a silica silica sand sand like the beach\nSorry so here's another one try this one here okay so this is a national brand here right right so this was five hundred milligrams okay this is a true of all yes All right so take a look at the ingredients\nOkay I'm ... sucrose sugar okay ... sugar sodium a score right\nThat's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium right vegetables therapist said that that lubricant again and F D and see yellow number six there you go number six so now that's artificially collared vitamin C.\nNow what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different from these that we are talking about\nWell what's different about as I used twenty two different forms of vitamin C. and it's all naturally flavored natural colors there's nothing artificial ... so it's good for you and it's the only one that has this unique delivery method of being able to drink it down it's water soluble goes right to work in your body and it has\nThe proper amount of vitamin C. per survey there's Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving ... there's nothing else on the market like it I've done tons of research vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies and it's really survive the test of time and one of these studies suggest what are they saying well I'll give you I'll give you a couple of headlines\nThis study was conducted at the University of California and it found that people who to the vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease were reduced over forty percent ... study reported in the international journal vitamin the nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes out ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C in their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Miller leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen\nIn your system or energy that's just one vitamin C. wow now earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work well this is the kind of groundbreaking research on vitamin C. and weight loss but what happens is vitamin C is a natural appetite suppressant\nAnd it also increases your metabolism and your energy when your energy goes up yeah you start feeling better you can go out and take a walk let's burn some of it off\n[noise] so you've created this supersede Tony to formulate its a powder right you mix it into a great tasting beverage invokes you love the taste of this now when you take your super see twenty two former ... is it something you can feel\nWorking I mean what ... what can I Do\nWell the first sign of health is more energy you're going to have more energy more mental

S. A. P. S. owes them and this is you know we've been talking about this pretty much for since may now when I come out to see my family's in my household my my whole goal is\nI'm there to do my best work for my family is I Am not a solar company I Am I'm there to do my best work for you I've become an energy expert some people call me an energy I'm advocate a consumer advocate\nUm I'm actually friday I'm meeting with one of the board of directors of one of the big electric companies because I get some pretty I'm pretty important information that it's not privy to the public ... a [noise] a pass just had a rate increase of guess who's getting ready to have a a another rate increase um it's the other electric company\nSo I go out and I find out accurate information and for for my homeowners my family's because my goal is to put more of my family's hurt her money back into their pocket not the electric company a peace made four hundred and eighty eight million dollars last year in profits [laughter]\nWhat do you think their profits to this year when they rolled up these new rape plans and we haven't even seen the end of this year yet it's it's just it's astronomically ridiculous and you know we worked so hard to to own our own homes [noise]\nUm and we come home at the end of the day and we want to live comfortably but we need to live affordably in in our own homes and now\nThe power company has to be ... to tell us that the hottest time of day between three and eight PM so whether you are retired and your home in the daytime or you're working and you're coming home at five thirty six o'clock [laughter] they're getting you they they know you're going to be using electricity and that's the most expensive power that they're charging us for\nI Want to help as many families as I can understand this because this has never been about just slapping solar panels on your roof [laughter]\nUm it was my daughter almost ended up being a bad for story and I was watching out for her and if I hadn't of had the ability to create this formula and my ... you're going to tell people how to go so that I ... my daughter would have ended up being a bad for story [noise]\nUm there's lots of them out there there's lots of people calling me saying Sandy I went with the company in that company can you please help me I don't want to see families I'm going down a road that that that they're not going to have the maximum benefit has savings [laughter]\nIt's a you know if you're working with the company and you want a second opinion you get a second opinion when you're having a surgery or medical opinion that this is just as important this is your family's home this year power source if you're on the right track I'm gonna take great you're on the right track there's enough business out there for everybody\nBut if you're not going to explain why you're not and what my recommendation is to you so please [laughter] this is not something that you do lightly and you don't do without thorough\nResearch and sitting down with [noise] um yeah I Am I have become an energy expert in this particular field because it all started with my daughter my daughter's home we were my grandchildren Liz\nI needed to make sure that it was going to work because\nThat was my daughter's home and where my grandchildren ... and the other reason was I couldn't afford to help her pay her power bill if it didn't work so I take the same formula that I utilized for my daughter's home\nAnd that's the formula that I use for every one of my family's homes that work with me\nAnd that's why I'm so proud to be able to show people\nThe evidence of my work and with these new rate plans and everything the bills are starting to come in I'm asking my family's just send them they're going to be up on my website we're putting them up there Tom but please go fill out your kill worksheet it only takes a minute Jeremy is going to tell you in a minute how to go to my Web site\nAnd if you have questions I I really really like when people ask me a lot of questions I Want you to understand that I Want you to understand\nHow your bill works now I Want you to understand how you will be saving money when you are no longer renting essentially renting power from the the power companies and producing your own power on your roof and paying less for it and so I go to my Web sites which Jeremy can tell you how to do that\nYou you got it it asks solar Sandy dot com that ask solar Sandy dot com and make sure you're going to the right one no one postures make sure it ask solar Sandy dot com\nFor again if you're like me you just want to give them a call do six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine that six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine and yeah the website geez you go you see right up there that kilowatt worksheets\nYou click on it and you're starting right there that is the best way to start and get it going because again you want to be saving money we're going through all these built\nAnd I'm seeing your payment made zero point zero and came of age zero they're not paying their savings so much money but like you said it's one thing at three o'clock where you want to come home you want to get the AC on you want to start the laundry you want to get the dishes and you want it to you want to cook dinner you want to cook dinner I don't watch TV you what\nYou want to be able to live comfortably in your own home Jeremy [noise] you know the savings are there I I I really can support the savings but again it's about living more comfortably in your own home\nAnd you know we we had one ... one of the most significant rate increases issue actually it was a two part increased first part was ruled out last year and the second part they snuck it in may first calling in New Reid plans a PS kind of does things like that\nAnd then they give us an accurate information when we call and they make recommendations oh that plan a very similar to your other plan now they're nowhere similar they're nowhere close [laughter] they're selling us to stay in power only they're selling it differently more extensively to us and if we think this is the last increase or the last um [noise]\nThe thing that's going to impact our cost of our power here in Arizona we are sorely sorely mistaken [laughter]\nUm let's talk about um I Am doing a town hall when things one of the things that is going to impact our power costs dramatically is everybody's been hearing about prop one twenty seven so yes I don't know\nThe and the signs all over the oh my gosh\nAnd then you see the ads one says yes one says no and okay I'm not going to get into it on the air and that's why I'm doing the town halls I'm doing a town hall November first six PM and I'm doing a town hall November fourth\nAt two PM please call or email me to get the I I got the venue pretty much locked down but I just want to make sure that everything's a okay and I'm having that done today\nSo if you'd like to come and just kind of understand what this vote means why it's is tricky and confusing as it is\nBecause there's people in and saying yes means ... that just means you know no means yeah there is a lot of confusion over this [laughter] so I Am doing this town hall because these are the kinds of things that affect you\nDirectly not indirectly directly\nThese kinds of things are going to affect how you live and how far do you live in your home with your family and your family's budget and cetera so I really want people to understand when they were voting on um election day in the first Tuesday in November\nWhat and why they're voting the way that they are and some come to my town hall if you're unable to come I Hope you are able to come but if you're unable to calm [laughter]\nUm I Will probably have a I Will have a pamphlet flyer I'm closer to the date so\nPlease pay attention to these things these are things so the way I so I did five radio shows yesterday by the way that I address is on the other shows is the way that you don't allow something light prop one twenty seven to affect you and your family directly is\nBird do share on power on your own roof\nWhere you are making your free will and choice [laughter] how are you are taking control of and central bill no matter how high it goes you have to pay it now you've stopped that down once you're producing your own power on your roof\nIt passing us of peak and raise the rates once twice three times a year if they want and it's not going to affect you because you have all the power\nThat you need to consume being produced on your own roof and the way my formula works very different than a lot of other people's is your exporting power back in a PS and your during your bills S P\n... there is a reason why we can't do that there because that's our P didn't want anybody going for seven years ago\nSo they're super peak rates are like thirty eight cents in the summertime or work with me you're going to be paying somewhere between ... half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt were not exporting he back and want you to consume everything\nYou'll select your professional
