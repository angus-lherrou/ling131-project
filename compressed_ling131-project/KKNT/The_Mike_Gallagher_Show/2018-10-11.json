there's video or about to we're about to play it for you here out of Seattle, Washington a protesters and demonstrators taking on police officers in a brutal way it is so profoundly sad\nUh so it's

us a thirty five thousand foot view an overview of the congressional races what's at stake what we're up against because quite bluntly I'm tired of hearing well the Republicans are going to hold the Senate but they're going to lose the house is that a foregone conclusion\nAt this point in time we are seeing a very volatile environment so from the outset of the twenty Eighteenth cycle we knew was going to be very competitive Democrats are very energized they want all out of ... that is that is their\nTheir their overall agenda right now what we're seeing with twenty seven days to go is a resurgence of Republican enthusiasm post\nA Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing\nThat is due in large part to Republicans coming back home ones who who might have been a little uh disinterested in in the mid term election but are seeing what the Democrats have planned we're already seeing Nancy Pelosi\nAnd other House Democrats line up a litany of potential investigations they plan to undertake if they get control the house and we see on a regular basis their candidates talking about issues like\nAbolishing ice undoing that you'll be tax plan and protecting sanctuary cities if they're able to regain control the house that is what's at stake in this election and I it has a way of turning off independent voters in motivating a Republican base but it was\nYou know I I heard of it last night on TV made my blood runs cold Kevin McCarthy pointed out Maxine Waters will become the chair of the house financial services committee at the Democratic control the house\nLike gosh I I I think that just motivated about three million people to call a crawl across broken glass to vote for Republicans in November to have that doozy chairmanship position anywhere I mean we're seeing the difference the stark difference Jesse between the angry mob\nBut there's been a British by the Democrats you heard the comments Eric Holder Hillary Clinton were not going to be civil unless it till we when my gosh the the protesters and they are all Democrats Jesse these are Republican protesters\nOne hundred percent we don't Maxine Waters is someone who who kicked off this\nA reprehensible behavior up saying that they should go in a cost to the White House officials are cabinet members are Republican elected officials in their in their whole near their homes in restaurants at gas stations wherever they are is that is the type of rhetoric is being used by the Democratic party day\nAnd that will become a kind of common practice if Democrats get in trouble that's why it's so important for Republicans to get out there and vote to match that democratic enthusiasm because this is what they want we saw the ... you know you had the\nPotential twenty twenty presidential candidates up on

I have a theory my dear friends that is going to blow your mind\nOkay even the living martyr has not or heard this new theory\n[noise] it's not entirely new wife made reference to this for decades but I have now put it in the context of the current political situation I Believe that we will be seeing more violence from the left\n\nAnd I would like to give you a theory as to why I I I mean my first theory I wrote up a few weeks ago and the very important column\nI Know it's important because it got just on town hall washing they were twenty two thousand or what is it again what am I forget that we're not forwards ah when people pass on some no no no come on guys [noise]\nShares yes I don't know why it's I think of shares in terms of stocks I think that's the problem anyway\nI wrote the first reason I Believe that is that the left unlike liberals again the left\nDo not believe that they are\nObligated to the to society's rules of of behavior facts Hillary Clinton said that just now did you see that we we have we ever saying if we have a ... a ... or any way if we do I would like to get it on one year old and the Eric Holder that's exactly right\nWhen they're down ...\n... and they're ... they're down so we take the high road they take the low road and when they're on the low road we kick them\nRight so there there are absolute invitations to violence and of course I mean I think violence is a a complex term in some ways is it violent to scream with people while they're having dinner at a restaurant\nIs an interesting question if in other words if you're not touched is there is there all the violence is the only sense that can be involved in violence the sense of touch a it's an it's an obvious question but anyway\nThe second reason this is my new idea the second reason the left will\nBe violent is this I'd like to read to you and this actually is ... is a a something I ... in my Bible commentary about certain in chapter forty\nSix of genesis about out yet sprint anyway so let me give it to tell you where it's from okay it's from three professors Roy Ballmer iced or who's been on my show with major criminologist bread Bushman and W. Keith Campbell in an\nArticle called self esteem narcissism\nAnd aggression\nDoes violence results from low self esteem or from threatening the ego wisdom\nWhat matters is self esteem or ... I think Russia and that's the main with the peace if it was published\nFebruary two thousand in current directions and psychological science ... it's the journal of the association of psychological scientist\nYou are you a new one every couple of years you know ... you never let it lapse that's impressive it is just impressive so why you would meet everybody but the article so these are all professors\nSelf esteem are so similar aggression from current directions and psychological science from ... from the year two thousand now I'm going to go to it until you are just a simple one\nParagraph conclusion violent men seem to have a strong sense of personal superiority\nYou hear that\nI've told you this many times assigning boy now my sister\nThat in his study of criminals which has his whole life work he found that that they have violent criminals had higher self esteem than the general population\nI continue favorable self regard is linked to violence in runs fear after another murderers rapists wife feeders violent youth gangs aggressive nations and other categories of violent people\nAre all marked by strongly held views of their own superiority\nWhen large groups of people differ in self esteem the group with the higher self esteem is generally the more violent\nAnd one that is why the left will be violent and that's exactly right [noise] I uh I'm tying in various strands that I have brought to your attention throughout my radio career\nIs exceedingly important to understand the roots of self esteem movement they are completely on the left John ... a left wing state senator in California I interviewed the man\nI understand where he came from why he pushed for it\nAnd California passed it I wrote against it what you could you take a look what the year was\nCalifornia delegated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the self esteem movement and of course it caught caught on we're even conservative parents\nStarted thinking about their kids self esteem as being important\nWhy do you think kids get trophies for losing [laughter] why because of the self esteem of but we don't want our kids to feel bad about himself\nWhy not why not\nYou should always feel proud always really no matter the lack of achievement in your life and what's the point of a treatment if you're going to feel just as good about yourself if you fail as if you succeed well Bob ...\nOh okay so you ... okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be hard would mind one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know you were a child of God I couldn't agree with you more that is on the self esteem to the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child with God high promise you do okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain ...\nThat is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am a terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd we go now okay there you are even laughing so that the proof why point so there's a there at the other is you believe I Am I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in earned his self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nOkay so I think we're on board on that the self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself\nNo matter how you behaved irrespective of religion can sell us grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem\nI think there's a big difference I don't see ...
