you know he's kinda he's got a struggling but we're ... [laughter] flattery we pray for him to first of all the Jesus has risen can we talk a little bit about this crossroads this this ... position of politics as you'd so brilliantly delivering your columns and in your appearances on Fox News and all\nAnd your deep faith but for some people make some uncomfortable but frankly at at at times like these I think I think that cross roads that intersection of faith and culture and politics is perfectly time\nYes you know it's so interesting we have a situation in our country I got a bad act a little I don't wear your sounded great okay but certainly is fine but I the\nOnly ones who are living in a very that's a that's what we have I Believe but an exit route\nFor the survival of this country and we have I Believe in a very effective president Donald Trump where I didn't initially support us for Ted Cruz I'd been with Trump ever since he won the primaries adamantly foreign we're facing the left you know I I used to be this purists conservative constitutional conservative and I am\nAs I said on Sean Hannity's show last night a feckless conservatism is an infinite conservative right\nAnd we and we like Trump because he fights back and get things done and I think he's actually become a pretty strong ideological conservative he's certainly unaffected one but we have the left out of the woodwork trying to destroy him trying to destroy everything in his path including Brett Kavanaugh and\nThey think they have a monopoly on morality\nAnd I think they they're worldview is so ... I'm Sorry to say it and I think it's self evident when you see a hateful they are how much safer jak how much they are exactly the opposite of what they claim to the I eat compassionate tolerant\nLoving their hateful they're mob there they'll do anything to destroy people at the end justifies the means\nAnd sell when when John Adams said that the constitution is only going to be so we're only going to work for a moral and religious people I think what he had in mind where people like the left\nWho will destroy the court for example instead of upholding the constitution that legislate from the bench and at the end justifies the means they'll do whatever they want to do and we have to fight back and Christians who say we can't fight back because we're not being Christian they're wrong we have a duty we're not just\nOn this earth to sit here by standard we have a duty to try to preserve this culture for our kids and for ourselves and what made America the greatest nation in the world and so I don't buy into this thing that we ought to be passive\nWe ought to be active and work for them but there's one other intersection and that is\nThis is so controversial and so contentious in our culture so I think sometimes we need something greater to look to and that that something greater in my view is Jesus Christ and so I think\n... the books that I write on the subject are designed to get people in the Bible and reduce their intimidation and increase accelerate their learning curve so that they will also be more comfortable and going to read the Bible for itself and that's really mind go\nI'm grateful for your voice and I'm grateful for this book because we're living in a time you know David to those who are who call them ... who are conservative and spiritual\nWho oppose President Trump with everything that with every fiber of there being because they don't like his tone they don't like this which they don't like his temperament they don't like the kind of person he is\nWe're seeing what the alternative would have been to Donald Trump or seen it all displayed right now with this Kavanaugh debacle all its glory the left is what we would have running things if it weren't for the election of Donald Trump\nLet me tell you note for words were ever spoken socialism\nOr leads to destruction it leads to poverty and ultimately as high it talked about at least ... you can see that as well you can see it and in the left in the United states I said the other day on Twitter and I really mean this and I seem like a radical I seem unreasonable\nI
