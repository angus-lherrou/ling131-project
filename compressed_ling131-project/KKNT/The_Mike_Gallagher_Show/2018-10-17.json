[laughter] you know it's just the president counterparts so hard hit off from his himself\nAs sullen he's than actually printing just for that for the last eight to ten twelve months areas again returning to that type of mistaken over ... [noise] I Wish she went in case like\nThat just diminishes the proper victory a set of hitting all rise up now I I don't\nSay this to be disparaging about our our Fleischer I think he's a nice man I met him a few times and uh he served of course in the Bush administration\nI'm so he's a an establishment guy he knows the establishment world very well but don't you find it fascinating and again I don't mean there's just respectfully towards Ari Fleischer\nBut isn't it isn't an intriguing to listen to a pundit and that's what our is now he's like me like me I mean he's a he's a he's a guy with an opinion\nWe all have some of them have some of us have platforms whether it's already a appearing on Fox News or maybe with the radio show we're we're we're basically just guys and gals would opinions\nSo we are\nWe're not we're not really were not certainly an elected leadership were not in the government\nWe can impact people I guess I suppose it's fair to say we can change hearts and minds but in the scheme of things we're certainly not as we're certainly not as important as the leader of the free world\nDon't you find it fascinating that Ari Fleischer thinks he can tell this phenomenally successful president\nHow he's making mistakes in other words those who\nWrites or who opine can sit on the sidelines and say oh you're making a mistake you're wrong here for doing that\nListen\nI wouldn't call a woman horse race I admit it I'm not like Donald Trump I don't have this kind of personality frankly most of us don't\nThe guy I keep calling him as a ... call him the beach to forget name in the ... the limousine the drives that he drives around in the stretch Cadillac limousine called the beach that's the secret service nickname he's the beast but here's ... is kind of simple\nYou come after me\nI'm going to go back after you can fold I don't care if you're a woman I don't care if you're a man I don't care if you're a gold star family I don't care if your Mother Teresa I can see him going Mother Teresa a name if she said something derogatory about him everybody he\nAttacks everybody he calls a name everybody he just marriages has disparaged him first\nAri Fleischer knows that Lindsey Graham knows that\nThat's what Senator Graham and when he started out the clip I don't know if we do we have the Lindsey Graham catch somewhere gosh I just kind of rushing around in the hotel in the morning or here in Florida on uh on TV religious that he's a fighter he's a fighter but he ... he shouldn't do this you shouldn't say that when he's the president\nOr we're not going to accept the fact that he's not going to do things that traditional past presidents have done\nMeanwhile oh I don't know there's a couple of pieces of news you might find interesting if you're worried about the president calling a porn star horse race\nThe U.S is back on top of the most competitive country in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand and eight it's an it's the index produced by the world Economic Forum America climbed up ... one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries\nWere now ahead of Singapore Germany Switzerland in Japan we are the most we have the most competitive economy in the world and the fact of the matter is\nIt is likely due to all the economic policies the terrorists that are starting to pay off more good news about the terrorists are terrorists are controversial we can have that debate I get it All right to have the dialogue\nBut United States steel Corp workers or about to get the biggest wage increase in at least six years under a new deal negotiated with the company and according to Reuters\nThat's a sign that the gains from President Trump's clamp down on foreign imports\nAre starting to trickle down and impact American workers so he cares about American workers so he cares about American companies solely cares about Americans wow what a what a novel idea on American president worried about American workers\nOh wow I I it's been a long time since we've seen that it seems\nWages were frozen in the last contract with US Steel\nPittsburgh based company\nTrump's trade policy coupled with a strong economy has sent domestic steel prices shoring helping US Steel postal near sixty percent increase in pre tax profits in the June quarter now the less they hate that they had companies making money\nBut he companies passion that profit on to their workers but normal Americans normal people appreciate the fact that the thousands and thousands of US Steel Corp workers who are about to get the biggest wage increase they've gotten him six years are thrilled with bad news\nOr should be entitled to a ... a level of decency and respect that you don't call will ...

I I'm thinking about people being held the restaurants and shouted down and Hillary saying there can be no civility until we the Democrats when she said until we win in November\nWe never act that way we never do that to other people we never we would never do that and we wouldn't accept it there is a stark difference between the way people on the right and and in fact many independents react and the way these activists\nI'm behave and punish the ... the fact is the the the lack of denunciation by Democrat leaders or the lack of condemnation over some of this agree just behavior it's a it's a it's a powerful indictment on the Democratic party of twenty Eighteen\nIt is very revealing certainly to the degree that we can dramatize and make them pay a price on the ballot box we should but I Would go beyond that in saying that if they stopped getting even more out of hand\nWhich I think it's quite likely particularly if the Democrats don't win the house Republicans hold a house in the Senate and then we're on the twenty twenty [noise] um\nI don't expect to get worse and I think what it means is that a certain candidate particularly the the schools by Berkley trust me I have to end up spending and the national guard and\nAnd I think Republican ordinarily would find extreme shouldn't because protecting people First Amendment right I mean what could be more fundamental than\nThe

blowing\nI think I've said this is my whole life because\nI Can't imagine that there are eleven people listening to ... smooth\nSailing Tucker I I got to ask you a question\nHave any experience of it at all I mean I you know I have such a tiny light you know I don't really get a sense that people are watching my show to be totally honest with you you know I live with my white down the street from my brother and my dad and my college roommate and I think people every day [laughter] my wife is not that different but thank you\nWell I Know I you know what it's a beautiful answer and I'm not surprised that came from you I you radiate or a decency and integrity that is not common in your profession I have absolutely nothing to gain by saying that I'm looking for a job\n[laughter] so [laughter] I [laughter] space certainly\nAnyway folks Tucker Carlson of course of a Fox News\nTo be a Tucker Carlson Tonight Show on it for the even though it had a mayor which as far as I was just Tucker Carlson anyway he has a book out 'cause he he's thoughtful that's the reason that I'm I'm having your mom with regard to this I mean a lot of people on television right books God Bless them\nBut the Tucker Carlson is worth reading a book a shipper fools if there's a great a great title\nHow selfish ruling class bringing America to the brink of revolution so let's talk about your book the book uh folks is up at the dentist Prager dot com so why does it mean a ruling class who who is in that class\nWell the people that I grew up with um certain just to be totally clear I'm not much of a popular and I'm certainly not a representative who coal country I mean I grew up in ... in Georgetown so it's basically people who have thrive under our current economic system if you want to know\nIf you eat you know if you look around and you and the people you know are richer than they were before the financial crisis of two thousand eight you know you're probably in that group and it's not a word you know every society higher hierarchical because people are hire me dogs are higher males are\nSo you're always going to have a relatively small number of people who were the questions that are you going to have a ruling class the question is are they upped the task of ruling in my argument is that the people currently in charge or not and that's why we got Trump\nOkay so so ... has a very heavy stuff there let me let me dissect this for a second ruling class for you is an economic criterion not a political or prestigious criteria\nWell it is both in his boat [laughter] if you look around the country to three hundred and thirty five million there almost an infinite number of decisions he made about how those people live what they can say what you are living in a relatively small number of people\nMake a disproportionate number of those decisions so the economic decisions are made disproportionally in New York on Wall street in Washington by the Federal Reserve the political decisions are made almost exclusively in Washington the citizens about what your kids watch on TV or see on the Internet\nOr made almost exclusively in California and New York and Los Angeles and so you know the west side of LA has a lot more influence over the country than the west side of the I mean that's the way I don't I'm not saying that's bad\nJust saying if you have more influence over how other people live you ought to consider yourself a steward of the country and you want to make wise decisions not just decisions than you and our leadership hat and that's\nOkay what what in your mind was there a time when the elite were steering the ship in a good direction\nWell I mean you know democracy you need to start with on personal sort of democracy must have it's correct was it for a functioning democracy that you have an independent self supporting\nGrowing middle class you have to have a middle class democracy only works in middle class countries that doesn't work and said Venezuela where you have this dramatic wealth divide because you could give every person the code\nNot an economic franchise they punish you by electing people like Hugo Chavez for Nicolas Maduro so you need you need to know what you can judge\nThe ethic of seeing the wisdom of the ruling class by how well the middle class people beneath them are killing and our middle class are shrinking in absolute terms her life expectancy is in decline and so that was the most simple measure there is that's all you need to know middle class is no longer a majority of two thousand Fifteen\nAnd the people in shark ought to be worried about that they're not\nAll right so there were ... or the identical issues the decline of the middle class and ethnic and tell me this is a fair summary of your view a corrupted elite\nWell I think that's probably slightly more complicated and I think there are factors that I don't understand very precisely I mean\nNothing results at one cause of course that's always an oversimplification is always the problem when you're reading about this stuff so I mean I'm sure there's a lot going on our economy has changed in ways because of automation on the rise of finance or the product of no one person's decision I mean this is not a conspiracy I Would say\nBut it's a it it's a confluence of a bunch of different factors that have converged to hurt the middle class to devalue labor so that the labor of the individuals were much less than it was it Ninety seven because\nOf automation and technology and all of that\nHas made the average person less powerful laugh at one and the less likely to believe that his kids will do better than he will have which is of course the American dream\nThat makes our society more volatile and are ruling class job it is to think about stuff like this and to steer the ship in the right direction has ignored all of it has refused to take responsibility for their decisions refused to admit they're even a ruling class or even in charge\nAnd and and that's why we're seeing about ... I mean one big changes which is so striking to me as someone who's interested in the aggressive movement\nAnd Teddy Roosevelt and and the Arab robber barons what the Carnegie Rockefeller ships and you know the people who we think on that you know the fat cats Nineteen fifty they understand themselves to be the ruling class they knew they were the richest most privileged people in the society and they understood that came with responsibilities as well as\nCurrent ruling class Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and the\nTwitter guys and you know Travis over ... I mean these are kids who have a billion dollars or several addressing T shirt and act as if they're just like you and me they were used to shoulder the responsibilities that come with the power they wield and that's part of the problem\nWhy would they do differently if they were responsible\nFor the first thing he would do if you're an employer\nIf you're running a large corporation is think about the welfare of your own employees so it's always a tell them this is universal on the Web on people start talking about abstract\nIdeas rather than concrete solutions in other words if I run Hoover for example I've got one of the largest workforces in the world I think the second largest workforce in the world so before I started lecturing you about climate change\nOr black lives matter I Would the first thing I Would do is make certain that every one of my employees was treated as well as I could possibly create them I Would I don't know give them health insurance or pay a minimum wage I Would do those things because they're my employees and like my own children I'm responsible for them to some extent I Believe that\nIn earlier generations of leaders believe that they were motivated by in part the guilt they fill their religious convictions they felt they had a duty to other people are currently leaders for example it Hoover don't even claimed them as employees were drivers don't have health insurance or they're not super employees they're contractors that part of the gig economy\nAnd so we're letting the most powerful off the hook\nFor their obligations to their fellow man and at the same time we're allowing them to lecture the rest of us as if there are moral superiors it's a very odd arrangements for travelers from looper is totally confident who's a much better person than you even as one third of Hoover drivers will lose money driving Hoover so how does that work exactly I'm baffled\nI'm speaking with Tucker Carlson of Fox News his book just out to ship a fool's the subtitle is how selfish ruling class just bringing America to the brink of revolution [noise]\nThis is not at all the criticism it is only a an observation and I'm like you to react to it your critique is a critique that would would resume one hundred percent with folks on the left is that fair to say\nNot anymore my critique is one that would have been common among liberals in Nineteen Seventy hot\nThey didn't do that and I think the smart ones are credit now\nThe smart ones are what are they regret it now\nOh really no one one leaves you didn't want me to think that\nProbably ... I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks and a lot of really great people and nice people who work at each tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past four years in America has not become more conservative\nAnd the smart ones are asking where did we go wrong and it's not that they're not\nSmart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they get it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing\nWhat's he should care about is the way people live their family is the very center it's fleet Adam in marriage the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope of doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel funny asking you this but I it's it's truly meant out of curiosity 'cause I Do respect you where do you stand on President Trump\nI think that um well I mean just as an overview I agree with
