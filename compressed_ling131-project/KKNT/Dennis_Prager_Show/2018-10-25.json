{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "Um weeks ago in fact a week before that they were hearing rumors that something was happening that they believed there was going to be some kind of mobilization but they weren't certain and another thing that I found very interesting was that there were some\nAccording to the people that I spoke with now remember I still have to investigate that there were people within the United states people that belong to and she oh department official that we're very close to you have a left leaning groups\nThat were also somehow on the outskirts\nInvolved in this according to people that I've spoken with you know some of the groups that NGOs that work out their supplying food and water a passing out aid to the migrants on the buses that costs a lot of money nobody's gonna but people for free\nThat some of these NGOs were involved in it and that may have come ... US dollars do us eight or something of that nature I'm at so there would not only does collective organization\nUh based on Central American led to leadership you know can not only harm that government more conservative wandering government and or conservative or the mall and government not only to placate that and create some hard there but also it came time it was a U.S elections and to create\nA okay so I'm All right I I got older I got a lot of questions here so I I happen to know by by sheer will Bush totally sure and it's like I got cared a lot to know what I did go down to ... at the time with his lawyer a controversy\nOr when she tried to install himself under the constitution and installed himself for another term as president\nAnd the ... the Supreme Court of Honduras and the Congress even his own party said that this is a untenable a book or he or she persisted in any event and then was kidnapped and maybe it was it was remarkable what time and then um during history so my first question is\nWhat ... what does the left in a in Latin America half the game would this caravan\nMay be more and I I Want to be more precise may be the miscalculated it seems to me and I think to a fair number of Democrats ... only helping the Republicans\nAbsolutely and I think there was a great let's calculation um you know especially if they were trying to affect\nUs election or U.S policy and for example its ally in Honduras and and you get a great explanation of that history with ally and it's basically an ongoing war with the current government and it's basically this continuous battle with the current government\nBut the destabilizing Central America or not the stabilizes our ability it draws risk in our relationship we saw that the you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship\nBut when you have this flow of migration coming across their border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't understand it but Central America allows people to flow freely from Honduras Nicaragua back and forth you know to various theories in Central America\nOn it so they can't really judge close the border down if people have their paperwork\nSo what the Guatemalan government was doing while I was there is they had buses ready to go they were explaining to the people that a United States is not going to let you in\nThat the Mexican government that this is a very dangerous journey and there were some children there that they had been lied to please hit on the bus let us get you back home let it get you back home safely now of course the organizers of the group we're talking against that no or moving forward we're going forward\nBut Guatemala was able to actually return nearly according to their their calculations around thirty nine hundred to four thousand people back\nTo Honduras the problem however Dennis with that once the Caribbean started moving moving through Guatemala moving to Mexico and movie and in Mexico more and more people were joining in so now you have it swelled to estimates right now like fourteen thousand\nCreating a potential problem for the U.S as a move towards the border which is the reason why the department of defense today\nUnder a James Mattis is now working at a point eight hundred troops to the border I'm to the U.S border in order to stop the penetration of these people from coming in to the United states should be some concern here remember this isn't just women and children which of course are going through it very treacherous track\nTo these countries um and and you know the heat and exhaustion and everything else that goes with it that dangerous to their own physical body and the criminality that's contained within the groups I mean I remember to them is Thirteen\nAnd within the group that came in across the Guatemalan border we don't have background on these people that are coming in and we are or where they're from or All right hold\nIt there I Want to have a very important question he's the president clean and to the left hand ... be stabilizing Central America\nBy withholding aid from Guatemala and Honduras we'll be back Sarah quarter but I guess this is a dentist prayer show\nWithin a Springer show\nThe release your brain freeze\nDo you all know about ... food

I don't I don't really know yet\nAnd the\nThe analysis that I have an I offered at the beginning of the last hour is very simply the the amount of rhetoric of hate and of\nCalls for in your face physical behavior and the actual violent behavior has been so overwhelmingly from the left\nThat ... it's it's almost surreal that people would say it's the president's rhetoric\nNow forgetting these this bomb issue about which we know nothing with regard to who sent them and why but putting putting that\nAside what speakers are threatened at colleges the you know that for the first time in my life of decades of lecturing\nI have asked for security when I go to Colorado State next week I have never asked for security I'd been given it routinely but it's it's ... to me it always struck me as a sort of pro forma thing you know ... to one before police officers would accompany me from my car\nA buddy in this case I actually asked for\nThe rhetoric of hatred or that has been directed against me in the in the Colorado State newspaper is is quite remarkable\nIf it is it is probably the like lives it is all made up everything about me is made up everything\nAnd it doesn't it doesn't matter to them because truth is not a left wing value wife said that my whole life this proceeds Donald Trump this proceeds Ronald Reagan this perceives a\nIt emanates from my study of the left from a college graduate school on it has never been a left wing value it's a liberal values are conservative value but it was not a left wing value and this is this is a perfect example\nMy mind is what I mean there are so many and the cost of violence or you wouldn't even Mika Brzezinski acknowledged Maxine Waters\nTelling people get into the face of of politicians I Wonder what I'd like to know the last time that in a member of Congress of the United states told people to act on civil Lee towards fellow congressman\nOf the other party I Wonder if there is a precedent to Maxine Waters truly an ugly human being and I'm not speaking of her physically I never in my life talk about people's physical all looks it has nothing to do with that fuse ugly in character in temperament\nAnd decency in morality\nAnd ... but it doesn't matter because it's you know it doesn't matter\nBut Stewart credit Mika Brzezinski after blaming the president then goes through the let me of of you know including Hillary Clinton will only be civil if we win ... she said that bill was it last week Lori Clinton will return to civility after we win\nYes look to the ah the face of the left is coming through\nThere is a way to defeat the left though there is a way to embolden liberals as opposed to the left is managed to defeat them in this upcoming election you see it will be very hard for the left\nTo convince the Democrats other Democrats there are after all liberal Democrats not all the leftist they support all left his party to their shame but they're not all leftists\nBut they won't have a harder sell hey our way is the better way if they can't even beat Donald Trump\n... owning owning the colleges owning the high schools owning\nThe newspapers owning the cable networks except for Fox owning mainstream news and if they can't do it then uh maybe uh maybe their tactics are and all that effective so there is a way to defeat the left\nYou ... you have to vote in this upcoming election I I

people elected I thought you were going to challenge ... ah or you know take a position against me and I wanted to go to the left no problem\nI don't have no problem with people who agree with me but uh\nThere is it's just too premature if one is going to make the argument it could easily be someone on the left is on the right yes I Would agree with that I I think that if it's possible but I I ... ... it's ... there's no way of knowing if it's like betting on a on a roulette wheel is no there's no way to know\nIt could be a all I all I Know is if you've seen any of the pictures of the\nPackages

Indians and uh he adopted an Indian child now so I just reviewing what we've said do you recall the point that you were making or should I Move on\nYou know actually things and that's what I Would love to jump right back in the court yes he was of course I'm getting ready for commercial but the point I wanted to make was that\nAt the time ... was actually considered it a lot of it on the issue of American indian some people really really went after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water\nThe reason was because as president AT T's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the Indians and put their resettlement west to a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of white\nPeople that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral knew what are we at the time it was a really complicated issue and chats and it was very worried without question he was worried that\nThe whites and blacks would have very very high procreate at birth rate that they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them out populating them so removal to the western territories was way to actually protect the Indian cultures that we used to the thought now the again the execution of it was horrible\nBut his intention I think was generally a good one\n[noise] that that's fascinating and that's one of the book is an important book value don't only defend him on the Indian issue you have a general sense of Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I found so I think we all know that and it's true that Jackson was an incredibly violent man there's just no way around that\nIn every way he was but he also had really certain rules so that violence never ever could be applied to women or children that was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians and white to get a deep respect strangely enough or beautiful enough yet it's strange\nInteresting respect that women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost ... times anti traits again Indian women as well as black one white one\nVery very well but the other thing I found about him so he's got this violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting\nBut I also found Dennis and counter so many current politicians the guy was just unbelievably artist in everything he did and I think it would it kill his soul to or done something that would have been misleading or dishonest\nThat that's how much of a stickler he was about living out this deep deep profound honesty integrity it's really quite stunning\nHow did he get to I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound\nOh well so he had a couple of quite a few good things in a number of Jules\nBack he had been a preteen and the team and a Thirteen year old he fought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured in Jackson during imprisonment and now talk to a British soldier\nBut sort of a hill to his sword\nCan actually beat in Jackson skull or even until it would Jackson died um go mail can still layer finger in that ...\nAnd it wouldn't be actually even with the rest of the school that's how deep it was that's the kind of thing ... would never forget by hitting me but I'm sure you were thinking\nBy the way it was ...

Walker is on egg shells in our society\n\nIt is it is a wonderful thing I I have always tried to walk around with boy say anything that that offends this person and uh it's a monitor built into me\n\nBut every good things can go too far it's one thing not to gratuitously insults somebody and it's another to have to walk on eggshells with ... with members of every other group putting your own\n\n... it's it it makes for on natural relationships\n\nIf you can joke around and if you if you can't say what's on your mind it's that's not that's not an achievement against racism or anti Semitism or all the forms of bigotry telling the\nCheap but it's it's a form of\nHyper sensitivity bordering on nonsense and on on on natural ... if I Can't talk to you a member of a different groups in me naturally\nWhen I mean no malice and that's key frightening malice then it ends of the issue if you think I mean malice than don't listen\nThan I should be I should be extra painted from your wife and I don't mean I Dennis anybody\n\nBut if there isn't malice intended then then what is the ... ... what is the hyper sensitivity it's it just means I Can't talk to you naturally\n\nAnd that's what that's what the left because it's always me just cause you see it's it's it's that they've got to be fighting some some new evil why they're micro aggressions because they acknowledge there's so little real racism in society they have to make it up\nOh you didn't mean it but you really are are you really are racist\n\nSo all it does is make it harder to talk men to women women to men most especially men to women 'cause ... you know you can't insult the Mad Men are insulted constantly there on a daily basis\nMen or men or men or men or men or if you want to say women are then it's it's over\nYou were a hater you were a big if you're a ... but you could say men are till till the cows come home\n\nSo we're we're breathing on natural this is not this is not a an advance in relations between different groups it's it's a deterioration\nThe issue we used to\nAs I wrote in my column a couple of weeks ago that was that a lot of people seem to enjoy than they should I spoke of my time at the Rotary Club ... how a New America was exceptional in my in my mid twenties when I joined the ...

election could shatter all records for mid term elections\nIn terms of the voter participation\nNow still not comparable\nTo say Australia where you get fined if you don't vote\nBut was Americans choosing to participate in our politics that's a good sign for America isn't it if you're one of those people were you haven't voted in the mid term election before\nA but you're going to do it now and send the vote participation just soaring above any previous record going back even back before Nineteen fourteen so last super high turnout midterm election\nOf tell me why what is it that is exciting you and turning you on about this one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and one of the things you don't get to vote on is I'm Megan Kelly because no matter how much you\nWant to continue watching her on NBC's Today show\nApparently that's not going to be possible and this particular case is one of those where I think\nThat people who were treating this treating her as a victim or treating her some kind of horrible criminal or both wrong or what Megan Kelly displayed in her interchange on NBC about black face and Halloween blackface uh costumes\nDoes not represent racism and it doesn't represent innocent victim mode either it's just represents colossal monumental indescribable stupidity she's a lawyer she's obviously a very bright and capable TV journalist\nAnd for goodness sake given the fact that she had just a couple of years ago a huge explosion of well deserve controversy for her insistence that Santa Claus was white\nAs she should have been able to watch out on this because what all of this is based on and she was commenting in a discussion about a Halloween masquerade which looked truly awful frankly uh by ... the lessons to his one of the real\nHousewives of New York and um she um she dressed up as Diana Ross and pose and put out pictures of it and uh and and Diana Ross and of course it was very um a\nLight skin and as soon as she was trying to approximate that wearing a big giant afro wig and it looked awful and ugly and people were offended by it of course and a Megan kill eight took it upon herself in a conversation on air\nTo defend the idea of dressing up in blackface for Halloween a very very stupid point to make but here's what it sounded like\n[laughter] it's really you do get in trouble if you are a white person he puts on or a black person it puts out a way we\nLike that that was okay as long as you were dressed up as a character it feels like something is offensive to them then you should stay and stare at if you're going to be able to take it\nYou've got to be able to take it okay Allen broker of course veteran a weatherman on NBC or was one of the many many many people demanding that Megan Kelly apologize and er here here's what al ... had to say\nThe fact is on for a while she apologized to the shields a bigger apology\nTo folks and color around the country because\nThis in the history going back to the Eighteenth ers minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right when I'm old enough to live to Amos and Andy scenario where you have white people in black and he's playing to black characters and when you're\nMagnifying the worst area we talked about black people and that's what the big problem is\nOkay yeah it is a big problem and by the way Megan Kelly saying when I was a kid it was okay to dress in black face she's forty seven years old if she was a hundred and fifty years old maybe maybe it was okay or or even if she was\nEighty years old or Ninety but I've got to tell you I'm older than Megan Kelly I hate to admit it but I Am and uh when I was a little kid it was emphatically not okay if somebody had showed up at our Halloween carnival in my elementary school in San Diego California\nUh wearing black face costume for Halloween I think they would have been asked to go home is it has not been okay\nFor a long time a long time and that's something that Megan Kelly as a graduate of the University of Syracuse and Albany law school and somebody who's been a TV journalists for a long long time\nHonestly should've known her apology on\nAir was very carefully composed and it was meant to say for career obviously and it sounded like this\nThat want to begin with two words I'm Sorry [noise]\nThey made her they answered a we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it'd ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their face later or a white person making errors darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume and old okay\nWell I was wrong and I and [noise]\nOne of the city and its cherry\nGetting [noise]\nTalk sometimes I listen [noise]\nAnd yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface news in hallways\nMy country\nIt is not okay for that is part of the Halloween otherwise\nI have never met ... kind of person [noise]\nBut I Do understand the value and being sensitive to our history chicken early on race and ethnicity\nThis past year has been so painful for many people of color\nThat country feel so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and the fence I Believe is is it time for more understanding more love more sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to [noise]\nRare rare right ah well didn't work she suspended or now it looks like uh\nShe uh she's not going to be on air on NBC and she's also dumped by CIA the talent agency major Hollywood talent agency the handled her\nSo she's done by both but she may be able to collect a what's left on her sixty nine million dollar contract so good luck with this I I Do feel there is something\nBut first of all black faces disgusting and all you have to do is go back and look at some even some quality old movies I I'm\nOne of the films that that comes to mind is a wonderful movie called holiday and with Bing Crosby\nAnd it it's a lovely film accepted has a sequence in it with Bing Crosby in blackface singing the song Abraham about Lincoln's Birthday and pretending to be kind of an old slave and it's so cringe inducing its horribly embarrassing\n... an enormously popular a singer\nAnd just enormously popular and he of course was known for doing his shows in blackface do I believe that Bing Crosby and ... and were were horrible races I Believe that they basically shared some of the values of their time where\nIt's almost as if there was something funny something humorous about being black because it was so different and the whole minstrel show blackface history\nIs a little mental and it it is an indication of how far we've come or do I think there's any defense for Megan Kelly making making the case\nThat uh uh that wearing black face on Halloween is okay no there's no real defense for it but is it perhaps an overreaction to see her entire career go up in flames because of this one stupid passing comment\nHere's the point um [noise]\n... media and I have lots and lots of problems with them and I don't want to say that Fox News you never hear any content that's questionable and I don't want to say that uh over at CNN or MSNBC you you never hear any content that's correct\nUm but this whole idea that an entire network of some of the most conscientious upright a decent far seeing Americans that I Know of a work at Fox News and yes there is some and CNN\nAnd uh to to write off a whole network because of propaganda against it is just not fair ... I've tried watching some time I don't think you'll see a lot of stuff that you will find have full are alarming I'll let you go to Kevin in Columbus ohio Kevin you're on the ... that show\nHello Kevin\nWe don't have Kevin ...\nUh we will go to another call from Columbus Josh you're on the ... that show\nI like all like to talk to you great to talk to you [noise] um\nSo I originally called in to say why I'm voting for the first time in the midterm\nUh good at it here and why\n[noise] well I think it's a way of expressing yourself all the yanks that people are saying and feeling right now like these ... bomber\nA with these pipe bombs you know I think part of it is ... and yes he is probably here she is probably a a dysfunctional person I'm Sorry I'm getting off track [noise] so I'm voting because I think when people that are in power\nOr you disagree with that if you tend to to look and see what they're doing and being paying more attention and so I think that the best way to express my feelings about this situation and my lot in life is to vote and vote in the local level and the state is the best way to do that\nNo good for you as one way or the other but\nThey're no good good for you are I can I ask are you voting for ah Sherrod Brown or are you voting for congressman or when I see\nA ... at this point I haven't looked over their platform as let's say at all the governor debates uh that's far and I'll I'll be voting for Cordray for governor um\nUh that's interesting why um I agree with\nIssue one uh mostly um I I thought he did better in the debate I feel like the viewpoint wind up\nUm after that that that's kind of how I took away when I took away from it\nWell I knew it was fascinating as you know Ohio carry big time big league for President Trump won Ohio by nine points and\nAnd right now ah I Know the the governor's races close a Sherrod Brown the very very liberal senator\nWho really shouldn't be voted out but it looks like he is going to win and what this shows is the American people are not doctrinaire they're not automatic about their voting but I I salute you Josh what you're saying about voting to express yourself to get involved\nIt's a good thing and it's the right thing and congratulations on that let's go quickly to David in Duluth or two for a okay we will go to David in Duluth, Georgia in just a moment\nAre
