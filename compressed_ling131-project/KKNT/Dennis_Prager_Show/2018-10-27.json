now the volt meter that you have when you're cruising down the road and everything is okay is it pretty close to Thirteen eight to fourteen to is that either for the light in\nThe air conditioning on it goes for Thirteen and fourteen to hell\nBecause that's perfect and when you're cranking it should never drop below nine and a half or ten they'll say that's a good battery so you can always watch that these are numbers that we all use its not numbers I'm making up every shop in town uses these numbers but now when it what's the lowest you've seen the voltage\nTwelve\nOkay and that's just what we call static battery\nNow ... uh twelve point one is ten percent charge to twelve point force forty percent charge the twelve point eight is eighty percent charging thirteenth full so if you're down to twelve votes you're you're just cold cooling costs static so you're not charging anything at all at twelve votes\nYes yeah so I guess the alternate or I'd like to hear from you if the alternate does two things if it straightened up your ... gauge and gets rid of the noise that would that important to me\nNow is the second part of the question when I replaced your state or is it just the alternate early on everything on the back and then just run it through if there's no other thing when they're strictly shale cater\nKnow their their regulators going to be inside the Alternator bought it and Albert brushes and the ... trio and stuff but I Want you to pull the negative cable and then you have this disconnect a battery so I I don't want you to have power 'cause\nYou know the other day one of my guys was wrenching on the back of an alternate Ernie hadn't disconnected the battery and some of his ranch reaches over and hits the ground and there's a whole lot of sparks in wipes out the diodes on the air so I got to buy another one okay\nThank you betcha you betcha Darryl Europe next um how can I help you out\nAnd mark a great show hey I can make it quick I've got two thousand seven Toyota Tacoma it's a V. six automatic four wheel drive and I'm I'm retired so I'm trying to do\nSome neglected maintenance and I've done a lot of ... says what have you but I'm trying to service the automatic transmission and boy it's it's an ordeal and I I think you've talked about this before on line but maybe I'm wrong there is not a traditional drain\nAnd shell procedure like you would see on Ninety five percent of the cars there is a dry and blood on the bottom and the adjacent to the transfer case down low on the translation there is a lot of ...\nI got an a serviceman you all you can drop a band that plays the filter only a couple of course of oil come out\nAnd then it tells you to bring it up to operate and capture and it tells you use a scandal and it'll tell you ... and then you can drink more ... is there a better way or am I missing something totally here with these translations\nSo ... how are you going to head flew to the ...\nWell no they they tell you to help it into the site and that there's a silk port and if you download by the transmission\nGod so then they tell you it has to be operating temperature for everything to cycle more fluid than what is contained in the past\nI've had some on some of the forms they said they go to these places they hook it up to your transmission cooler lines near the front of the uh\nUh rated out of the bottom and then a cyclist up through and supposedly they got a machine that can claim a refresher fluids I thought I've never experienced that before\nOkay um well here's here's the problem that you're going to have the problem is is um has never had the filter changed by pulling the pan do we know there's a filter underneath depend is that what your service manual says\nYeah yeah I did it when I bought the truck and again it was all upset at that time was just ... and it really is not even a they call the shelter but it really just looks like a grain that's why it is that I shouldn't say wide open it's not a traditional shelter like God of automatic translation okay yeah now I ... it looks\nRight All right so when we did that it go ahead I'm Sorry\nIt's okay when we hook up the slush machine or just shove anew and an ... year old out so we have to clear hoses so that the one that's going into your transmission is going to be read nice and cherry red fluid and the stuff that's coming out is going to be different\nSo we're just flush it's until it's clean\nThen we're going to use that that over Phil whole when we're all done and while we're doing the slush we're not going to rejuvenate your flu and you're going to pay for all the flute we're putting in and that's it right in a court system and we use twelve to get it to what Rand claim then you pay twelve\nBut we're also going to have somebody inside the car going from park to reverse the neutral to drive to low in the back and forth we are going to cycle the all the fluids through all the valves body in through the converter\nAnd so I usually I tell people just do the filter screen first and then from that point on depending on how dirty it is at that point we're just going to move forward and we're just going to do a flush about every Seventy five or eighty thousand miles\nNephew has earned her daddy or you can go to a hundred but um it it might be all of us are real familiar with with what we need to do often times there's going to be some like you said a scanner that's going to tell us that we know we're we're okay on the on the fluid liberal you wouldn't have that\nBut there's other ways you're going to find on the Internet that people there's a Phil hole and chances are that there's going to be some kind of we don't want it coming out of the ... we want you to hit the bottom of the ... whole that's that's yeah they're common\nYeah there's an overflow indicator on the transmission so they're they tell you to be careful and\nThis is where your drain it and ... indicator okay and that's what they recommend so okay so just to it sounds like I could do to filter it get it written topped off with at least as much as I said just measure what you took out and put that back in and and\nSo is there any place in Prescott I live up in Prescott any place you recommend\nNo um I I'm embarrassed to tell you I've tried to find somebody in Prescott and I can't I Would like to spread out my wings but if you come down the Seventeen there's Tom and deer valley and I Seventeen northwest corner and then at bell Seventeen is Kurtz on the northeast corner and both of those guys are\nOf qualified and well season and both of them have gray hair and both of them are master technicians they they know how to handle your your Toyota now\nOkay my daughter is ... ... ... or someplace closer\nI mean you can go to a automotive dynamics on grand in Ninety ninth avenue or you can go to ... eighty eighth avenue and tea Berg guy so those guys are in that particular area as well and you're going to you before you leave your going to ask them and they're going to give you a range because they don't know\nHow long it's going to take and how much fluid it's gonna take but you're on of transmission flush you're going to be in the two to three hundred dollar ... and ... and especially if it's got synthetic fluid and race and so it just depends on whether whether what it calls for and if it takes just regular decks drawn or ATF no easy what yeah\nTaking type yeah so yeah so I asked some funky fluid always seemed like I can only every part of it you\nKnow [laughter] that that's what they want you to believe the fact of the matter is is if Toyota used to say you had to use Toyota filters eureka it used to say you have to use our vacuum bags there's a ... as it's a\nIt's a federal law it's called the Magnuson moss act and it says if you must use the proprietary\nWhatever on your ... you have to provide it for free\nAnd ... ... max life is something I Would probably look at and ... life has the charts and if you can file your toilet in there then it's certified that fact that balance max life will fit in your Toyota and frankly that's probably what we'd put in it yeah\nAlready okay thank you betcha speaking of transmission is automatic translation exchanges on forty a street and Washington he's been around since Nineteen sixty eight Phil and his staff are really good guys with respect to transfer missions\nThey know how to fix transformations and they're kind of guys that will drive if you can duplicate the problem then they'll go with you but they're not going to let you drive to lake pleasant and back that's not going to happen but you get the problem or you point out\nThat the leak is right here below the rearview mirror right and in the middle of the car that's the kind of tough customer that saves a lot of diagnostic process\nThat feels been around a long time he's capable of small lakes transmission services and all the way to the overalls and he was around with transportation automatic shore first there as a result of that\nHe's very skilled on the newer modeled transmission is because all we're doing is using the electronic sewn to redirect fluid and pressure or before we used manual vows to do it so the transmission is still the same we're just shift in your car electronically so forty street and Washington the north side of the road\nSix oh two five await zero nine sixty six oh two five await zero nine sixty Jeff I'm going to get your question ... probably take you on the other side of the break but go right ahead\nYeah I got to the older models a Chevy ... dropped the three eighty three stroke or create motor it and I didn't know it will change and I put a five to thirty for me it was just tend to be thirty to conserve\nNo no and it and let me just explain real quick I Want you to put the palms of your hands together and this is new technology we're putting zero twenty some cars today so you put your hands to get them you you you fly them real fast and you can create the heat in between the palms of your hands you rubber I'm real fast now I asked you\nThe main thing that day ... burning down thanks sitting around here right right make a sharp right turn gets announced it sounds trite fire right\nWell it's it's not really a ... flush on a differential it's a drain and refill soon we're going to actually drain and refill your transmission and that the easiest part of that is is just simply what kind of car truck\nWe talking about a it's an AA Shadi blazer okay so it's going to have a cover on the back of it so we are going to take the cover off\nAnd all the fluids gonna dump out it's going to give us a chance to look at the the pattern on the teeth of the ring and pinion it's also good when you give us a really good idea of if it shut and metal and normal differential shed metal it's the amount of metal that's the season guys know what to do\nThat then we're going to put a new gasket both up to cover them there's a hole in the side and we're going to fill it with gear loop until it starts to come out and then we're going to stop how many miles on your car or truck\nHuh I'm getting plenty\nOkay have you and you've never done a differential service\nNow for Twenty years and I haven't done anything like that\nOkay well if I were you either have it done and you can call around and just tell them I've got a rear wheel drive GM\nAnd um I I ... you know what what will cause for a differential service and and I assume that you're going to pull the cover off the back and then now some guys are going to stick a straw in the ... hole and suck all the fluid out\nThat's okay that's going to be cheaper and they'll look at the fluid and say you know it looks good or looks worn or looks really bad\nI think it's a better idea to pull the cover off of it so I can look inside I Want to see how the teeth are mission and I want to look how much metal that shit based on that you've been around the world for times\nSo I'm more happy doing it that way but if you want me to do just what we call a sucking fail then yeah just stick a straw down in their turn on the machine suck out all the fluid put it in and now you're probably in the vicinity of Seventy five to eighty five dollars I'm guessing\nSo that you got those two choices\nI Would think you would do the first you'd you'd take the cover up so you could see everything and then maybe if everything was okay then the next time you did a service which is going to be another eighty to a hundred thousand miles maybe at that point you pull the cover off or you can do a straw sucking fill because you've already done the covered the first time so those are your options okay\n... thanks okay\nUh-huh Bye bye and the service differential I'd take notes on all you guys Wayne you're up next how can I help you\nNeed your help Mark I'm good at two thousand and one could MR two inch Christine got sixty thousand miles on it the engine light when I took it to the guy that is a certified of\nLike this guy and I'm sure we get to replace the canisters I I don't know what that is but okay oh that's a net six hundred and Seventy five dollars a\nWeek later the light comes on again so I bring it back and\nLook at it diagnostic equipment by the way so he comes back and he says it's the now my mind as an old guy it's what you call it ... it's a way that you can open in ... what is it\n... what is that as you're\nTalking about ... el ... you guys have been mentioning it all day and stuff anyway bottom line is\nThat tree place so now we're closing in an eight hundred and then [noise]\nI'm saying you know what Arizona law says I can take my car in within Ninety Days of the late ... coming due and I can do and I can get inspection done\nSo I'm driving to the inspection I Am half a mile away and the lights come again okay\nI'm going to take it back but Mike ... you know what I'm concerned about is this\nAnd there's no great answer for a while I'm going to ask you but I get your opinion do I take it back to the guy that has worked in my car for four years who is certified\nToy you know a Lexus do I go to some other guy who's going to start over and do the diagnostics again and charge me a hell of a lot more money [noise] um\nWhat do you think I should do\nI Can't believe for the life of me why\n... years so kind about this I Can't believe that you let him guess twice clearly but most of them were gases if that guy worked for me he'd be put on probation\nAnd and then you talk about him being Toyota certified which gives him God like the skills\nWell he's not exhibiting his God like skills there's no question about that\nFor whatever reason he's struggling he probably doesn't have an and everybody's got a scanner but do you have a smoke machine and do you know what the smokes machine does and you know how to use it and what kind of information as you get any\nAre you pulling vacuum on the fuel tank or is the sensor that's supposed to tell the computer icy vacuum is that center bad\nSo you have to determine which one it is so we're going to suck the fumes off the tank and burn him through the engine but in order for the computer to know that the valve is open then there's a sensor that says oh I see no I don't see pressure any more I see that Kim and I'm simplify and everything to make my point that\nUm [laughter] I have a code every time or we don't know\nWell you know what it was kinda crazy I still went to the emissions place they said well maybe there's something stupid that\nImportant it failed\nWell in it but the code is kind of meaningless is what I've been told like it's it's a generic code they could do with thousands of thing so what I'm Wondering guys bottom line not to take up all of your your time is it is I'm surprised where do I take a car\nAnd him or to not not a Chevy Ford did it\nOr not but I Know it off\nYour car using jet fears that uses cranks have censors it uses gasoline it uses air in mass has mass Airflow center has spark plugs just like the cheapest ... in the whole wide world so it's it's fundamentals it's fun\nIf you go someplace else you're gonna have to go back to him and you have to say I'm eight hundred dollars down buddy this guy and I've got thirty days behind it and he suspects that here's his old part now I bet you didn't ask for the old ...\nOf course I wouldn't know what I Do think\nOkay well if you did you could go back to him and say ... I've got thirty days he fix that here's his repair order with all due respect clearly you didn't so here at my old canister and here's mild whatever else I'd like you to put those back on and I would like to you to give me a credit\nBut I Want to tell you something I if that guy that guy clearly hasn't doesn't have the skills or the talent that you think he does and he doesn't have the skills and the talent that I Know he should have in order to be doing this job\nAnd so I'm not going to put him on that presidential well that's a bad word in this climate today I'm not going to put him in that God Bless the positions of knowing you know all about Toyota's because clearly he doesn't\nNow so he could have easily fixture car then go drive it and watch what's going on\nHe could clearly see if the monitor reset and it's you can't do you can't turn off your ... you can't have a light\nThan what you do is you disconnect a battery and you think you're going to sail through emissions that is not going to happen because in the middle of we fixed it to the middle of emission test is available it's called the monitor and the computer wants to see the engine go through a series of stop go fast or slow left turn right turn on how many times we started it's called\nA sheet cycles how many times we get hot how many times does it get cold\nSo there's no fooling the emissions anymore\nSo you have to be able to have the monitor reset which shows success and then you go through emissions in his case the light came on and the the monitor never reset so he never kicked this problems but ever\nSo I Would if you're going to go up north um if if you give me a where are you at again\nIf if let's say simply fail and grand\nOkay I'd go to Senator Byrd auto eighty eighth avenue in Thunderbird\nUnder auto yeah and I called Sunday or bird auto yeah\nEighty eighty eighth avenue in Thunderbird I'd go him and tell Tom Marc Salem says he doesn't have a chance in hell if he's going to be able to fix your andme are too and watched the veins in his met pop\nSo ... and tell him I've taken it to a Toyota expert this is called waving the flag in front of the bowl okay I get to an\nExpert in a Toyota guy and he replaced a canister and he replace that and here's his two bills so Marc Salem says you're not going to be able to fix this but I thought I'd give you a try\nTen of his our in our veins aren't popping out of his back by the time you're done [laughter] I Know what's gonna happen he has myself what he's going to call me two minutes later to go and he's going to use bad words but that's okay he's the best guy in your area to pull this off\nOkay that sounds like it's way too tired it's now how many shares did you put in\nI I got at least four maybe five sham in there\nOK than than than we have to and is this problem existed ever since you put this in\n... before okay that are starting to go out about three or four years ago and I just got to use one friend of mine and did the same thing and it worked for about a year and the housing crash okay well uh they're starting to that I Am\nA about a year ago at the same thing happen is it that it had a crack in the house yeah\nOkay well what part of the time do you live and\nI'm at forty third avenue and\nOkay um have you got a pencil handy yeah OK\nOkay I'm going to give you the name of a bunch of guys that can help you with a guy but they're going to have to see the vehicle um you can go to ... auto at thirtieth avenue and Indian school Bob's an old race car guy\nHe'll help you I Know he can fix it I Know Billie at twenty fifth street automotive twenty fifth street on a motivational drag racer I Know he can fix it\nIf you want to go north than Tom black well he's a good friend of mine he's Henri as all get out um\nAnd but he could face [laughter] so ... those are the guys that could pull this off it it it really has to do with blowing up the teeth and and matching the teeth to the flywheel to the teeth to the starter by chance you know what the starter number you're using his\nOh gosh I forget it it's like a thirty thirty six sixty or something like that thirty six ten maybe maybe it's thirty six ten okay I don't remember\nAll right well you ... what you said yeah the three eighty three but that's still a small black Chevy that's just been poked right\nNo no it's only at three fifty oh okay well then it's only had three ... and it's a it's a block mount shorter than the other\nYes mount starter okay yeah\nSo I I Would take it over there and and or you can go to fill it automatic transmission exchange forty street in Washington ... ... ... all those guys know what to do and and what you're describing is is the fact that it's it's gnashing of teeth when you go to fire it\nAnd it won't release the teeth and now you have to wear 'em the teeth\nIt's either got the wrong started the wrong flywheel or we need to re sham something we need to take some shims out but see it it doesn't make sense to me because if you got a bunch of ... in there and you're still clashes teeth it's probably not a sham issue\nSo in that particular case then I Would be going with you uh fly wheeler starter but I think it's five ten is your starter I could be wrong but I'm just trying to work off memory and the world with that number thirty five ten\nThirty five to thirty six ten\nOh thirty six ten I'm Sorry I'm thirty six ten thirty so I think if you look at if you look at the park spoke and you go to the parts store\nEverything every small black Chevy all through the seventies and probably the eighties the thirty six ten was the story is just the starter for the small black Chevy during that time frame sorry rice\nWould they charge me for this\nI have not been out here I have no idea it's ... they're going to tell you you know it's this much it's going to be between this and this they're all going to give the rangers but I got to run because I got ten seconds to go but with those guys could fix this up six oh two five away zero nine sixty we got Bob next and we'll be back right after this\n[noise] did you know rein treat auto repair spring number one in the

I've got an a two thousand Fifteen jeep Cherokee latitude in two months ago and I gave in to my wife and decided to turn on the navigation system okay\n[noise] um it works pretty good for about a month and then a mother and a half an hour away from Iowa to hear\nIt cramped out to the point where it thinks it's in in Des Moines Iowa and ... and the compass keeps on going around in circles I called up a the the customer service and they said ... drive in a circle a ten times it's counter clockwise and that took care of the problem\nWell it didn't you go to the ideas\nYeah I Want you to follow the procedure exactly like the manual says and there's going to be a a procedure in your manual that's going to tell you how to reach center of the the compass in five north\nAnd typically they're right but there's a lot more to it than just going out there and doing circles and hoping some policemen doesn't stop you for being looking like you're an idiot but I Know that all of our cars have that same thing now if you do exactly what the manual says if you just go into the area of the compass\nHe's saying one sixty eight so see what happens let's go to the phones Jim I'm I've got you what can I Do for you\nGood morning mark demonic a last spring I decided to put my two thousand eight Subaru Outback and storage and the battery was nicely charge so hooked up a a folk charge into it and er\nDuring the summer I checked it periodically I'd open the car door and the interior lights went on a knife and bright and I figured that was a good sign but last week I uh\nDisconnected the folk charger gotten the car but the key and the mission during the gay and bam a battery exploded what would cause that\nWell there's this park somewhere either inside and and let me ask you this so people understand that's probably the loudest explosion you've ever been to Jason too isn't it\nIt's a good thing I was wearing my depends\n[laughter] you ...\nI got to tell you there's been times in my shop where we've created a spark on top of a battery that gassing\nAnd the explosion feels like a semi just hit the main part of the building is eighty miles an hour if it is now I Hope you got the hose out immediately and washed everything down as fast as you could give okay I guess\nI'd say you had to spark heat inside the battery or outside of the battery let me put some holes in what you're thinking that that trickle charger was right didn't blow the cap softer to blow the whole top of the battery off\nA it was a failed battery blue uh what were they kept them off and a blue for four holes in the battery case itself\nOkay okay [noise] more than likely the explosion occurred within so it's the ... because of the explosion in the battery but there's no guarantee of that we have a spark either on top of the battery or ... inside the battery that's all there is to it\nThe fact of life came on doesn't mean anything because the light needs half and amp\nAnd you know the battery at eight at eight votes nine volts ten votes can pop the light on and so that's not it when you hit the key you said to this battery give me all you got and when it charged up to give you all got it blew up so I think what you do is go back with a good battery\nPut it in there and then this is what I Want you to try\nI I Want you to plug in your your battery maintenance device and um I Want you to let it sit for three or four days I Want you to do you have a ... meter by chance yeah okay good go hit the terminals and under the best of conditions you're going to be pretty close to Thirteen votes okay\nThen I Want you to take off your battery tender and let it sit for a couple of days and you better have pretty close to the same voltage\nNow if it was a see if my number one battery was the seals batteries and you're not allowed to put water in it but a spark underwater is not a spark\nSo sometimes what happens is is even though they say sealed you can tip 'em sideways and you can see the water level is well below the plate so then we just don't screw those stupid calf pulled a label off the top on screw the cap and puts them distilled water or just regular water in it\nSo like I said a spark underwater is not a spark so it could have easily been something that caused it to drop in in voltage are dropping and\nIf you overcharge if it's going to consume a electrolytes and so that's when you start dropping down below the plates and the plate spark and that blows up the other thing I Want you to do is is when it's run and I don't want to see anything more than four fourteen point five\nSo when you started up member were doing these voltage desk we hold the idol up high or\nHave your wife hold the I looked kind of high and I don't want to say anything more than fourteen five and if he sees something in the Fifteen range than you have a problem with the alternate or in regulator and were oil in the water out of the battery that's what's happening okay\nIf ... is it possible to float charger was defective and it over to charge the battery\nIt's not likely and and let me change your question mark have you ever seen a tender go crazy and they have ... no I've seen them work\nAnd not work and and trust me I have\nI put the ranch I probably have for tenders running on a bunch of my farm equipment my excavators and my tractors and my Bob cats in my high lift and stuff like that so I have never had any problems in the last ten years with four or five and then I have a tender on my polaris and my Honda Claude\nThat I used to go round up horses sometimes\nSo I've never seen a bad tender never\nHave seen him bad when they quit working but I've never seen one overcharge anything\nSo for some reason the electrolytes level went down\nYeah it it could have been at the very beginning or but that's why I Want you to check the battery ... after a couple of days I Want you to check the battery 'cause if it's up there north of fourteenth five than the tender is bad\nI I don't want it to charge more than fourteen five and then we'll take it off it's going to be about fourteen and that's those are the two numbers I Want to see\nAll I've already put a new battery in it and everything is working fine in fact ah I I Will check though again I Want to make I don't want to use them I don't want to use the flow charger again without testing it tells you guys have asked me to soak\nIn and let me change let me change my numbers I I'm wrong I Want you to write down this Thirteen five and Thirteen I don't know where I got the fourteenth five but when we charge battery we we might go up to fourteen votes man we might go up to ... high idle Alternator running wide open so that was\n... I was under the impression that it float charger maintained the voltage it which was when it was hooked up and it wouldn't take it above that that home out of it started charger it just to maintain or\nI I understand but we need to maintain and the Thirteen votes okay that's fully charged so we didn't know that for years and years and years but like I said everybody agrees today twelve point one is ten percent twelve point five is fifty percent and Thirteen is one hundred percent\nSo it's not uncommon for me to hook up a battery that has twelve point two votes in it\nAnd go back and I'm going to use it so I'll stick with my vote meter and it has Thirteen with the tender off of it so I brought it up from a low twelve to Thirteen I'm pretty happy about that so it's not going to maintain that because if you plug it in its twelve one maintaining twelve one is not a good idea\nOkay all righty thank you for the education\nOkay Jim thanks very much had a lot of good information and as as with most of us guys um we we we know how to say yes and no but few of us know how to say I don't know [laughter]\nI mean I Know have the I don't know comes from the ladies at the front counter of the auto repair shop because you asked them a question in the end at the appropriate time they say I don't know\nBut you can interview a hundred guys at the front counter and uh and especially if you ask him a question about what's compression ratio on your car they'll throw something that [laughter] but it and I make fun of the difference between men and women because in my industry there is a significant difference\nWhen we talk about men and women women will make the noise in the lobby full of people and guys won't guys will describe the noise but most of the time the noise is different to them than it is to us\nSo vibrations are different the women will will ask them questions does a shake deceive your pants shake the steering wheel does a shake the passenger side front seat\nThere is specific reasons we ask that\nIf it shakes just this during will the vibrations in the front end of the car if it shakes just your but then the vibrations in the back of the car if it shakes the seat next to the driver and the steering wheel than we got a vibration throughout the car\nSo that helps us diagnosis so the few minutes you spend at the front counter with questions and answers then and then that's really good time because it's going to save your diagnostic time\n[noise] don't let anybody sell you anything before you check the owner's manual there's a lot of um repair shop at first of all let me tell you that the repairs industry is suffering because in the last three four or five years the cars that came out before before this problem\nEverybody had to thirty a sixty and Ninety maintenance stop virtually every car and truck out there had a slew of stuff that needed to be done at thirty six ten Ninety\nToday it's all gone to Seventy five two hundred\nWe have very few stops we might have a few filters stop between zero and an eighty or Ninety thousand miles\nSo we've lost all of this maintenance because the car comes with synthetic transformation fluids synthetic differential flip synthetic engine oil it's got spark plugs that go a hundred and ten thousand miles the battery will go the alternate or some more sophisticated we have all this going on\nSo you can imagine if you are like man you owned an auto repair shop and you saw sales falling\nYou might decide that you want to start selling people something that you know that doesn't fit within the parameters of their owner's manual it's not uncommon for people to tell me that they have a two year old car and the shops telling them they need to change their fluids in their transmission at thirty five\nAnd I asked them to look at the owner's manual and that's not what it says and then sometimes I'll hear this all here with a service either said that the owners manuals not written for Arizona\nThe labor pool changes or they change something changes and it just doesn't work so we're back to the idea of did you put enough away in savings and I would say for most people the answer's no\nI don't generally have people who say gosh I saved too much I really didn't have to do this [laughter] [laughter] so I Would agree with you on that one\nAnd there may be a few out there but uh yeah I don't think so most people instead of trying to figure out if they have enough saved away and if so will back go together with their Social Security to provide income that they need mhm\nAnd that right there is the heart and the basis of putting together a retirement income plan what do I have\nWhat do I know is coming and why do I hope is coming in and going and then going from there and and determining what income I Will start\nMy night well started what would the taxes the on doing that and how's that going to play out in the long term so I'm thinking I'll do this today but it's got to still be good for me in the eighties I recently met with someone who said why now have to think about the eighties but I'm really worried just over the next few years while\nThat's the point of it all is\nHuman we don't tend to think out a lot of years we\nTend to think in the moment and that's good because that's how we you know survive but you know these important but that only focusing on how you'll be the next few years can be short sighted in may lead to a a mistake of spending you know too much in the early years of retirement thinking that\nI'd probably want I'm not going to be one of those who lives to be Ninety\nI can stand more today so we need to understand that\nWe have to have a plan that says yes you can spend more to now when you first retired boy is that normal but how we're going to do later on and just you know tracking it out and making sure we keep track of monitoring it as we go\nA lot of people don't realize that uh their Social Security benefits may be taxed a lot of people don't realize that uh if they wait we're not taking the benefits at age sixty two that the full retirement age is has been moving up and I believe it's sixty six now right\nSixty six some for some sixty six in so many months because it's going up sixty six and two four six eight ten and then sixty seven is a sign of full retirement age\n... or you can go beyond final for retirement age Seventy and you get an extra ... percent per year\nMhm severe full retirement age of sixty six should get that eight percent per year for time if you're full retirement age of sixty seven you'll get that eight percent for three years\nIt's ... eight percent for three years ... only four percent yes\nFor the rest of your life for the rest of your life and so it's important that consideration because if you go on the other side and started sixty to\nYour benefit reduction could be as high as thirty percent so anywhere from twenty five to thirty percent for the rest of your life\nSo does it make more sense to take the benefit reduction or does it make more sense to just take what's there or something in between or to hold out and tell Seventy and get that additional enhanced amount that goes for the rest of your life\nAnd a lot of people as I said don't realize that they may end up paying tax on their Social Security benefits\nYou may we have a pretty low threshold for taxation to start on Social Security that particular programs not ever been index for inflation and so we're still looking at it at a number that was set in twenty ... twenty Thirty years ago and of course our cost of living has gone up I guess anymore I should say at least maybe thirty to forty years ago\nI Would have to sit in at that up because time just races on doesn't it\nOr we had a faster than most people realize and before you realize that you turn around and you look and you say well I'm almost ready for retirement but I didn't save enough for retirement\nAnd in the numbers that you need to be saving are really substantial now you can do a little bit of catch up on this process um and there are some ways to do catch up but let's say you just wanted a million dollar nest egg at age sixty five retirement age\nThat's a nice round number yeah I think most people would say okay a million dollars mhm a male okay with that a lot of people do I think that this is the number that they\nCome up with yes\nSo if you start at age twenty five saving for that million dollar nest egg and you're assuming a seven percent annual rate of return you're not going to get seven percent across the board but it'll be up and down and all over and maybe it'll average out to seven percent oh you only need about three hundred eighty one dollars a month\nIf you start at age twenty five you wait until age fifty five looking at five thousand seven hundred Seventy eight dollars a month and quite frankly most people don't make that kind of money to set aside that kinda money\nThat is a lot of money to be pulling out if you're a monthly income that would be very difficult for most\nOf those people are going to fall short yeah yeah but and so it's starting earlier\nIs important ketchup or milk or on\nFor one case if you're over age fifty you can\nInvest in additional six thousand on top of Eighteen five so\nYou can do a fair amount in four one K. is less and an IRA five thousand five hundred years standard and you can do an additional one thousand catch a provision on there\nYou can it's sometimes with couples I see where they can go a period of time or if each\nPerson in the couple is is working but they can each one of them put into therefore when Kaine used they catch up and that really does give them a you know put some on the fast track to being able to get their accounts bumped up to where there'll be able to create some good income in retirement that would meet their retirement neat\nAs we continue will take a look at another shaving ideas

them why smart retirement with certified financial planner Fleming\nAnd fit and clear and no\nAction which would you want to be back with a woman named for women to ensure looking at\nMistakes people make in retirement and more specifically looking at ways to avoid them we've covered a lot of territory so far Nancy\nThe H ... the long term care insurance those I think are are vital issues for many many people because they're gonna have expenses leader in retirement in ... when you first returned you're you you may be aren't even thinking about long term care issues\nYou're I don't think so you know where I Am some fun you're off work now you're off work and you've got this bucket list and you've got all these things that you've been starting to do it maybe is sort of started into them or maybe could go either way sometimes had people started a little bit\nKnowing when they retire they can blow it up some more you know do more of it and I have other people who just are like you know the horseback waiting for that weren't what they've done to go off you know and then they can just go for it and\nSo it goes either way but the biggest thing I see when we start here is if we have time we need money you know the old saying well if I hadn't I might have no money and if I had money I have no time the great balancing act of retirement is to have both\nSo how do we have enough time and how do we have enough money one mistake we sometimes see is that people don't calculate this out and they find themselves spending too much in those early years of retirement thinking while these first two years matter\nNot looking far enough down the road not visualizing themselves in their you know being eighties and the you off I ...\nAnd a half dead anyway and rock and a lot to do anything and all this stuff you know 'cause here we are sixty now and\nThat's not a healthy way to look at it and it's and it's important to it matter what age you are that you got the appropriate amount of income for your basic needs and then some lifestyle income and then obviously in case there's some type of unexpected expense one\nPlace where unexpected expenses come up all the time family\nSpecifically kids turns out who knew kids are expensive\nThey are expensive any I [laughter]\nI still marvel that if you have kids and you really love your kids it's\nOften you find yourself opening your wallet and sometime you end up opening your wallet for the rest of your life I Can't tell you how many times someone will say to me okay I have grandchildren or gosh you know what we're finally having our first grandchild in December march whatever\nAnd boy we would really like to start funding a college planned for that ... wonderful ideas yeah and it's a great idea as long as you can afford it as long as you've got your own income needs taken care of your future income needs taken care of because you know guess what\nYou can't to borrow for your retirement living\nYou can't do it you know again in this wonderful goal and quite a few people who will put in for children's um college because it's expensive\nAnd that's wonderful and the people I have can't afford it but if you just looking at it and you're saying\n... if it's an iffy kind of staying remember college you can borrow from college there's ... there's um\nThere's going to be scholarships and grants and there's ways to get money there's no scholarship for your retirement there is no grant for your retirement\nAnd so we want to make sure that your basics are in place in your foundation is in place so that when you go to jail somebody out because they lost their job or for whatever other reason we saw in two thousand eight with all the lay off\nA lot of parents helping a lot of adult children who have gotten laid off from their jobs\nYou don't really think about it that way but yeah there is no uh there is a loan to be made ... student loans being made for retirement\nUm so you you got to be careful with the kids and spending too much around the kids you got to be I'm worried about uh whether you're going to have enough savings to last throughout your retirement\nEvery now and then something comes up and you're thinking well maybe I should borrow against four one K. maybe a ... yeah but we as we said that's not a good idea\nTo not a good idea at but that doesn't mean you know people basically are I think pretty generous and people basically are really really just good hearted and really want to help when they can and um I Want to mention one area because we're in October\nAnd when you hit Seventy and a half when you have retirement accounts you start into taking\nDistributions known as required minimum distributions is is based on a chart that's put out by the IRS mhm and in addition to looking at how those will impact your tax wise\nWhen you're taking additional income and often I see that they're a requirement of distribution for someone\nIsn't even necessary for them to meet their basic income need or there's a piece of it the chunk of it not necessary for income needs and you might say well that's okay I'll pay a little extra tax but when we were looking at this there's two other factors\n... when you retire it's a fundamental change in your lifestyle ... and you just are on the opposite side of the coin so to speak\nAnd so it's also a fundamental change in your money so your taxes will be different because you've got\nUm Medicare premiums now when you're working or if you're paying personal insurance your insurance premiums aren't necessarily going to be based on how much you're earning I mean when you're at work and they pull out for insurance they don't base it on your what your pay scale is\nHelping veterans like Barry is

paralyzed veterans of America you\nKnow you're my smart retirement we're certified financial planner swimming and Sinclair no\nThanks so much for joining us talking with Nancy Fleming swimming financial services\nAnd you know here's something that can simplify life in retirement de clutter\nThere's been a lot said about that I read a book on it\nNow you got this book about declaring it was just clearing up the case\nI Do actually [laughter] but I did try to get rid of some other books I'm like you I like to keep my books I like to have a library\nThat we're seeing that becoming more and more popular particularly as people approach retirement age and they want to go ahead and just get rid of things perhaps because of downsizing or just as people get older we find them wanting to get rid of sentimental items that they have collected\nSo the question is what should I keep what should I not he I don't want to leave all the stops here for my family to have to go through when I have to move to assisted living or when I die or just near south thing my goodness look what's happened over the years I just collected\nToo much I can turn into a box is\nIn boxes and boxes of stuff you don't want to be at the mercy of identity thieves or something like that she got to be careful with disposing of this stuff it's not easy\nIt is and and if we first talked about I mean there are two parts to this is your personal belongings and sentimental values\nBut we also have bookkeeping types of things in tax records so certain professionals particularly small business owners Dr Denis lowers account and you can be required to retain records for flight a few years and we know the IRS generally has three years to initiate an odd at\n... bought you might wanna hold on just certain records including some actual returns for longer than that period of time\nThis it would also be important to do if it relates to the purchasing capital improvements on your home if\nIt has to deal with the purchase of stocks or other investments are funds inside of your taxable investment accounts want to make sure that your\nWhen you go to sell those items you're not paying access tax and a really big one if you are doing a non detectable IRA contribution or you have an idea right where some of it was pre tax in some post tax\nYou've got to keep really good record them if you wanted to make sure that the taxes you're paying on that account when you make your distributions are accurate all these refer to determining your accurate tax basis in order to avoid paying more taxes than what you actually all sorts of paperwork part of that that\nCan be a bit I'm a bit disconcerting for people\nI think so we tend to overdo it and we keep too much and so we've started to see more and more people and I've talked to a lot of people who say yeah I'm ... I'm I\nTook all this paperwork and shredded so much when they did it for at a time and recently um they're trying to get rid of stuff and it can be a bit of Treme yeah you got an old pair of shoes that are torn up that's not too tough to figure out\nSome things but even some of your personal records like what about a lot of people may retire right that ride a personal history\nOr your memoirs yeah and what if you thrown out some of your records that might um written records that might help you keep track\nOf those kinds of things I Know I did years ago I got rid of my records from my childhood just records that you play music on and who they thought that those became worth something later on actually retained one of them which I still hold onto\nAnd take very good care of that and even something that your grandparents had it could be a special blanket that they had it I'm\n... I Know that could be collectible ... collectibles mean a lot to you there are people\nPrecious moments come to mind there are people who collect any number of them\nThose kinds of items so when you're looking at stuff you know think for a minute to make sure you're making the right decision now also in the future but what's important what's not and and just because something is old doesn't mean that it's necessarily junk\nYou were looking at me when you said that I appreciate [laughter] here's another one that I think is really difficult to de clutter photos because a photo\n... it was made it a certain point a moment in time you can't go back and replace it so you've got all these old photos and quite frankly some of them aren't so great\nThat they really don't deserve to be saved but their photos\nThey are and it's really easy to say oh that one had red eye in it or this other one guy that was when I didn't look as good as I wished I Would have loved and so you saw photos thinking about how you look but then later say wait a minute there are people in that\nOh that I Would rather have added pictures of our I'd like to see myself with that particular family member whether it's kids that have grown up more whether it's people that are eventually moved far away or you haven't seen in many years perhaps they passed away and just so the memories of those voters are pretty important and I know anymore\nAnd my house we've been working on\nPutting them ... them in some way\nThat's a good way to do it because once they're digitized they really don't take up much space at all that's a real easy solution digitize yes\nAnd then clothing I close always come back and I have I'm Phyllis style and they do come back and there's actually two things that I kept from\nAll the years of moving from when I was a teenager young adult and both had to do with dresses that were stylish at that time one I may well when I made in my my mother had made for me\nAnd I've kept them because they're so I guess words iconic are there still retro whatever word is used but I can periodically pulled them out and wear them to sometimes a costume party sometimes seemed and vent and they always get a really good attention so you think about that too\nSo I should just wait on those bill but I'm blue jeans come back into fashion\nOr wait until you get invited to some type of themed party where it would come in handy yeah All right I mean I didn't keep tons of stuff I did but I did pick out the couple of items that were just like I knew I Would really like and want to keep for the future and they've held up while which is great\nTo be a little bit careful about throwing out some of that a clothing be careful about throwing out say a jewelry for example it it's really easy to throw out some valuable jewelry along with some of the costume jewelry\nOr that you feel you don't want any more be careful about that there are people who go to yard sales and in binge just looking for that\nKind of mistake and the reason why you should make it I'm doing I think there's just some of this uh\nThere's some sentimental value or somebody gave you something somebody in the family gave you something and then you say if I get rid of this what stuff\nIt is it is very very difficult to know what to keep and what to get rid of 'em\nI Know one of the things are like scrap books when you when you were a teenager maybe those old yearbooks and that's really was kind of a piece of your life\nAnd I know how I have a section where I've got different scrapbooks and things like that or from things from family members what about that you know some of those old black and white photos and when my mom had to go to a care home I she gave me a bunch of that family albums and they do take up space and those I haven't yet\nI'm digitized but they will be and um but I Do want to hold on to them and a lot of them are black like unfortunately there's a couple of people I don't know who they are\nAt this point and I wished I did and I don't know how to find out who they are but I'm\nHopeful that someday somebody somewhere will know who these couple of people are\nI tell you it's tough and I look back I moved in the past year I moved to a different house and so as we were packing everything up we said you know will will run a a yard sale\nAnd then whatever we don't solve a yard sale will take that on over for a for charitable donations and it helped to pay some of the expenses that we were having in in moving not much but if a few bucks\nAnd that was great but I remember as the yard sale was going on you know the\nGarage doors open somebody sees the trash can that I have in my garage this is how much for the trash can I see a dollar [laughter] I sold my trash cans for a dollar\nThat's hilarious [laughter] turns out you know I mean that's declaring to the extremes\nYeah that'll carried away there now I don't have a trash can actually I take that back I Do because a friend of ours recently moved into assisted living\nAnd we helped her with a with a yard sale and and the sale of her home and I'm at the end ... nobody bought her trash cans so she gave it to me\nHere I think it's great to share feedback from people that are really taking the product\nYeah here's one from ... in Texas she gives asked to have the X.\nFive stars and she writes quote after taking as to ethics my son was visiting us and said mom you more useful I'm a purity products customer for the last three years it will never go back\nThat's from a but here's one from Nina in Ottawa,
