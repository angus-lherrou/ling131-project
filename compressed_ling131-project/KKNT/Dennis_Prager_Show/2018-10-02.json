begin the callers are still there but\nTo the parents have been accused of surprise you even in the first place [noise] ...\nYou know if I if there were the vast right wing conspiracy which I was the head when she came forward to\nThat she would have been dismissed it but of course it would have been pre supposing with the Democrats were wholesale liberals like Alan Dershowitz simply would have said look if I were Dianne Feinstein and she weren't interested in the blood sport gutting this comedy a while we are mid eighties is her final swan song there\nWhen this letter came to me or the staff would have looked really pursue look if you want to be anonymous\nAnd there isn't any cooperation there it's a long time ago this doesn't\nCome across the threshold for me to pursue and I wouldn't be the end of it\nAnd the army speaking of Dianne Feinstein center Feinstein did you I don't know if you heard me suggests that Republicans in your the national committee men for public after Republican Party in California that maybe we should vote for her opponent so there's some consequences for what she's doing what she did\nThe top two primary system is another unique listeners should know that other disasters major in California that you're allowed to vote for two people doesn't matter\nOnly two people who get the highest number of votes regardless of party affiliation we have no primaries anymore minor parties have disappeared in California so I'm not constantly we get one crazy Democrat too far left wing ... Democrat\nAs our only choices for us and we can't even write in a terrible idea Democrat activists say the Republican activists have at certain rest abolition folks love it and it and so what we have is a dying Feinstein or it has as a left wing opponent and Sean steals aren't gonna vote for either one I Can't even right in what about what\nAbout mark suggestion that these people are so upset I tell you this idea of felt like calling the management fights on campaign Bill Carrick who I've known for many years and say you know\nWhat you're going to have those is the average Republican voter the average Republican or that's what we should just get it doesn't know that Kevin de Leon her opponent is more left wing than she is ... they're going to viscerally react against Feinstein voting for the other Democrat\nBut you do for your people naturally listening to the show they say California the wave of the future be where what this is is that when there was a so called primary the top two vote getters go into the general election matter what so if the Democrats are strategizing and take over your state when November comes you'll have a choice between bad and worse no\nThat's what it is that's what I said it's ... it's not only mine the other people have suggested it I think we should vote for her opponent and maybe she won't win\nRight if you want to be Catholic school do you say okay if she gets reelected you did or eighties she's getting less less energy I just watched the way she walked to the podium to talk to Senator Grassley there\nWho excel has not super high energy there and if you get the loan a younger person he's gonna be around for years so he won't have seniority that she'll have but he'll be a threat to us for a while I posted this on Facebook people are upset with me and they've been saying what\nWere the ... that for die and find something she was like more or less a kind of a semi acceptable Democrat because she wasn't as crazy as as as her colleagues but now she's joined that that that group and now we're back to the Salem witch trials in Salem witch trials\nRelationship disabled broad right I was going to say exactly but this was an Salem, Massachusetts a sixty Ninety two they can you know there were ... the errors hysterical people that were making crazy accusations against a a number of women there were hung\nA and they were accused of being which is and it wasn't even against what they did but it was it was their ghost that did terrible\nMark full disclosure is I knew Shaun steel when he was in high schools although no I'm not\nYou know let let that go I don't want to hear any more about that I Will do want to ask you though what she credible some listener picked on me saying all your talk shows are saying she had some measure of credibility\n... she was extremely well prepared she's a psychologist she's done the whole life she's been practicing this role for for many years to come she had a group of very smart media savvy lawyers\nAnd uh no she wasn't I thought she gave a good story and that was in fact there was a great presentation but when you dig into and you see that nothing about her story her life story makes any sense\nBut you say that and I agree with you but Republicans they didn't say she wasn't credible one of your callers I think the key points we always start out by giving her credibility there\nWell you know because we want to be courteous pairing not to be angry against women and and the ... and possibly somebody who was actually had this experience but she got the wrong guy and she probably knows in their mind in her heart of hearts that she got the wrong guy but she's ... she's a tool often but you know it's like our\nOur party they leak the fact we are going to have a women or a woman that question Kirk because we don't want these Republican meal\nIt's such a self to your consult right so is that a smart move terrible for the first of all it was a good move to to have these senators not grandstanding look you know ed Royce when each year the foreign affairs committee they hit it and ...\nAnd I looked and it was awful but it wasn't that he's competing but every house member one have their day in the Sunday or their Fifteen minutes of fame for there was no choreography no strategy no coordination\nSo they were wary of that I get that but why should I have to read the New York times or Washington Post is going to be a Republican tactics secondly they never should have done the traditional thing of alternating Democrat Republican and giving\nA ... I Know she's a Saudi every time so assuming that she was confident I mean I've been crossed with them if you have 'em and you want to keep going so he the we have lawyers on our sights as their US Senators who\nAre so weird that they agreed to this format rather say look OU Democrats could go through all used up there when you were done we're going to have our a personal question or\nShould have had you there was a I again the Republicans were in a bind they're looking at all the stats and appalled and women are angry and they've been walking away a as a sizable number of maybe ten twenty percent of women are walking away voting against Republicans 'cause they think Republicans are bought\nIn ... in in this hearing I'm going to say something a little bit uniquely different I like what Chuck Grassley is generally done he kept telling me you know what I have kept the tough schedule and look he's got a real problem at you and I don't have to face in daily life he has\nYou get eleven boast about Twenty one person committee no easy task and it's like it's like it's like you know so the whole hearing loss for one person in the universe a little short Jeff Flake Jeff like God is hearing any voted or out and I told you like what was your name what was your flakes name before he changed it to you know what I think it was born that way it's sad to say\nGeoff weasels yeah and then he changed thought it was ... yeah you're a lucky we got us vote\nI got to tell you something I'm grateful for that now flakes got another week going on with us I think it's actually good and I'm going to tell you my cold calculating political reason yes making my team very angry fired up their team's been angry and fired up for two years now it's about time our team wakes up understand smell the roses we have a nasty enemy here\nThey're about they're trying to take over the house of representatives and if you say gets bad today wait till you see Maxine Waters in charge of a major committee that's really going to put us over the\nTop ... it's very serious you were to look if the Democrats take control it who would share the two major companies in the house\nIt's it's a ... gallery of I mean you when you see people who are going to be an armed services they couldn't get a security clearance there are people going to be having oversight or the CIA officer the message clearly it's as I said you got to you know be enthused enough to go out there and vote and get everybody you know\nLook at the at the at the national strategy 'cause we have a national leadership there\nThe Democrats are counting on for example getting a few seats you in California like let's say Dana Rohrabacher and you talked to conservatives in Washington or not yet energized\nThey don't realize that this was a battle out here they just look at Republican registration so if you live in orange county right that you got to come out for dinner or what the hell now she asked national implications how few how she can do and make the different ...\nAnd I think average voters don't understand what it means when one party controls that chamber the Senate or the house there it means that they control the committees\nThat it is Maxine Waters there needs to be fulltime impeachment twenty flat\nOut not only that Orange County as the pathway for Nancy Pelosi will get four seats at risk we got great candidates oddly enough of the four seats we got three women running the Democrats have three guys running\nSo children so in other words what were we got the right demographic as you've got the right approach or getting out spent two to one six to one and some of these races we need a muscle up and get serious and show up like the Tea Party it in two thousand and ten so that's the conclusion we we got to get out there to all our listeners out there are women candidates were born women [noise]\nOkay was judge Kevin are critical that was a blessing I ah you know ... you heard the ... you heard the speech the little you know girlie boys that that we heard in the morning and you know this terrible victim and she looked good she had to make it because she didn't have any makeup on\nA she had a nice smile or by the way our entire statement was pretty written and and circulated did you know that it wasn't on the spontaneous Damon she she was all written out by her lawyers and she had she had rehearsed for several weeks probably for for many years of her life because\nAnd it turns out our sperm somebody so important that ... well on the other hand they they they you know ... the big argument at the time was you know you want a female asking questions well she's extremely well qualified\nUh she ... she had a terrible form at the bottom line is read the reader letter it it's all let's do that now I'm just going to do the points that too\nYou want to hold on one doctor for does not offer consistent account of when the alleged assault happened Dr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name when speaking with her husband is number three with her husband talked for change your description of the innocent to become less specific\nStuck for Dr Ford has no memory of key details of the night and question\nDetails that could've helped corroborate her account five Dr Ford's Kennedy ledge assault has not been corroborated by anyone she's identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\nSix Dr Ford is not offer a consistent account of the alleged assault seven Dr ... struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations center testimony regarding recent events further raises questions about her memory and my question courage you should have done this and wrap it up Dr\nFord's number a description of the psychological impact of the event raise questions nine the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely affected Dr forwards account and I think these are all great point because what why did she do it at a day or\nThe the first of all we all could front is that you say we're ... ... these are wonderful points but\nOur whole discussion is all this is on the the the the opponents turf there this is what we're discussing instead of cattle that we have to do it there but secondly you know the reality is that if this were done properly the Republicans when they were going to have her there they would have been different form and secondly\nShe would have had somebody play the role of this is a preparations there to go to all the possible response to get a good crashed cross examined an editor Washington where no matter what the answer to your ... your they know what's what's your follow up question goes a long one line or the other there and it wouldn't be any route interruption to go into there and you looked\nYou know I've talked to two to too many are women so we've been ah headsets will solve some of them out there but the the point that they all hinged on is that this was a girl who was not driving age who said that her her parents drove or places there\nBut she has no recollection of how she got to this party\nThat she has she went downstairs to the bathroom and somehow got home without telling you seeing anybody telling anybody else at the party like I'm leaving for somebody attack me or I don't feel well or just ran out the door did she hitchhiked whatever why didn't the prosecutor asked currently I cut it and I have to tell you with somebody who's been involved as a consultant many lawyers and in in cross examination and and some several criminal cases\nThat sounded so inherently implausible objectively so regardless of my political view there because first of all you would have expressed gratitude the person who took you always Oh thank you very much or even if you can watch all the details\nA gift that would've been on your mind and remember that if you don't remember how you got there maybe we're too drunk or there but when you left you had to ask somebody for a ride and somebody would have been considerate and said did you get home okay or whatever\nMark Mark I have to

the overriding ... it's like it was a non issue for the Democrats if Bill Clinton really did rape a woman I mean ... not it's not attempt one at the age of Seventeen but while attorney general of Arkansas\nAnd had state troopers find them women or while he was a while he was a governor\nThat is a non issue because the overriding issue was the guy was a liberal Democrat so far the overriding issue\nThe over rice so the overriding issue here is to prevent for the first time in their lives it conservative majority on the U.S Supreme Court so destroying the man is perfectly legit and then the mockery\nReally you know you think a lot of people just hear the music in the sense\nReally I'm happy to hear it I don't mind being an outlier but in that way I thought I was just weird to them in

Ramirez has an allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a party yell remains essentially where it was last week on corroborated and difficult to believe she was drinking heavily at the time she confesses that her memory contains gaps\nShe even told other classmates she wasn't certain was Kevin ... no one else could even confirmed he was at a party where the incident allegedly occurred\nFord has no corroborating witnesses and even the French he says was at the party in question has denied being there that's a friend\nShe believes the friend but she says I have no idea what party she's talking about or even knowing Kavanaugh she doesn't know who invited her to the party that is Ford where it took place how she got there were how she got home\nShe's offered substantially different accounts about when the attack occurred previously said it happened in the mid eighties in her late teens and in the eighties now she's saying that happened in Nineteen eighty two when she was Fifteen

like the like ... you know to go to school with a guy named Jack hence to the ultimate issues hours devoted to the belief that having a map\nIs useless unless you know where you're going\nYou know exactly where you are but if you don't know where you're going it's useless so what is it all up out of the big issue that's why it's the ultimate issues are after all so sometimes something in the news provokes a subject\nOn the male female our or for that matter the happiness or or for that matter the ultimate issues that are not as the\nCase today so\nI guess it's ... it's a multifaceted question but it revolves around one issue\nAnd that is if you are middle aged adults is it important\nIn assessing you how you active in high school it's obviously based on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and that's the question you're how old is she exactly fifty four fifty three fifty four years so you're in you're almost mid fifties\nIf you let me put it this way if you had an important position in Europe business where your school\nAnd you had to be unanimous agreement that man had led a remarkably good life as an adult lower words from the age of Twenty one\nSo for thirty five thirty four years whatever has been a remarkable human being contributor to his community a family man or a churchgoer which to me means something to many it doesn't\nWould view than we do you pursue allegations of misconduct in high school\nThat's the question I wouldn't if I were hiring for ... you are and\nI'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old ... put where the proximity to high school is a few years talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody applies for a job at Purdue University\nIt is you not miss what I find human being family man community man this person has been and then uh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same chargers\nOkay I Would ignore them\nAnd it is clear what type of adult you would have been I Am I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school so that's the\nQuestion that's the it's a it how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\nNot not not up to thirty twenty five but in high school\nOne a Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow I don't have I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy in high school I had a lead an anti cheating on his campaign I was elected the graduating class president\nI I was a bird was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that things could be brought up on me that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think it's a possibility or in the case of birth capital but happen or not happen\nIs it ah they were kids in in in high school who were uh near two wells and who ended up fantastic adults\nSo who cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act and high school I acted in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five\nThat's a separate issue you you because you you want to form a good person as early as possible I I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nWhat how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it matters that's the question\nWhat any Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nBig stuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business who knew what a terrific person misses and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you uh you you Rob the candy store that's pretty serious not not not simply\nNot simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner and and you Rob\nBut it is obvious she turns your life around it otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we will let no point to acknowledge\nThat you've turned your life around that is why religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism Christianity is so rooted in the importance\nOf pen of tens\nOf forgiveness\nOf tissue vi and in Hebrew of of return or that's repentance\nThat it's this famous Hebrew statement that I'm ... and I'm I'm literally translated from the Hebrew where a penitentiary stands the most righteous person cannot stay at\nYour a higher level if you've turned year ... life around the person who never turn their life around and it's been good the whole time\n\nThat's how that's how I Am and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people sins and forgiveness\nAnd uh the uh Judaism holiest days the day of of of panic tense day of atonement Yom Kippur so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo uh I emphatically endorse the notion that when you are already in middle age and the flood a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd primary where where's your cutting cutting off line as well as elementary school\nRight well you know elementary school well yeah that's what people said until recently about high school I Won a Prager seven seven six\n\nAnd let's go to will in San Antonio hello will Dennis predator\nHi [noise]\n[noise] well yes I can tell you a little that story um I was a high school or college or not did go to California the the whole the whole party scene drugs and you know ... you can\nAnd will play arrested for a ... and went to jail and it was kinda funny 'cause when I before I got you know for a guy that that are inside to get away from the navy\nWhat about seventh grade\nWhen does middle school start so six eighth\nGrade oh what is already six Rachel they whom six seven eight they should maybe\nYes [laughter]\n\n[noise] okay thank you [laughter]\n\nWell\nI it's ... it's a it's that you see what has happened look I I this is my lifelong one of my lifelong best such as this is not new we live in the age of non wisdom and we live in the age of ... wisdom because we have rejected the sources of wisdom\nWhich have been our founding documents and the Bible the Bible was the most important of all the founding documents you could ask the founders moving including Benjamin Franklin who's coal to the U.S\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo when you make up your own wisdom you're not wise that's the way it works but they don't believe that to be good ideas like Joes relatives\nOkay\nSharon embellish either Sharon\nHi how are you real well thank you good [laughter] okay so I'm On the same page that never stops creating\nAnd um I have five away some of them were really good at my school some of them I prayed making close to God and all of them would be great gadgets so you know I I think it\nYou know the big lie in the media\n... shattering thing isn't it if it doesn't matter how you've led a whole adult life that's what's being out in the United states of America\nWhere I work at a school and I was so sad when people see I just ... I was like these these kids are going to be good you know judging and just be a good parent and do the best they can and you know got in there and you got it right\nI think it usually does thank you I contend that for many years that my mother couldn't believe I didn't end up in prison\nYou you have no idea how often when I was in elementary school she ... she she thought I was going to end up in jail maybe that was the term in those days are showing you ever hear the term JV no right it's ... it's a very interesting juvenile delinquent\nNot a doctor or a jurisprudence\n... that's what she thought I end up at J. B. why don't you think that end up at jail because they didn't do any homework\nAnd it didn't work in high school either too busy or learning about life including teaching myself how to conduct which turned out well\nBut you don't you don't know you just gotta you gotta you gotta strive you've got to work\nOn your kids and then you don't know what's gonna happen but in retrospect you've literally a magnificent life\nYour your high school days in a relatively they're just not relatively why why why is that an issue about ... [noise]\nReading my column this week ... or ...\n...\n... oh okay well so it was just going to take a call and make up a thirty second warning they by the way I just want you to know that the people who are protecting religious\nFreedom in this country is the alliance defending freedom they won the case for the Baker oh they do it for free\nBut they can't do it without your support you know

different story that was four years earlier\nYou don't know that the person has turned his or her life around because they didn't have a life to live there for years but when they have thirty six

character you have to establish in a way you do that is in your decisions right or wrong and I think in that case if Kavanaugh on other people\nI think it's far more impressive to see someone who

fabric of America is is is at risk here of the laws of basic decency basic human conduct basic behavioral norms they're all at at play here at ... am I being too dramatic\n[noise] I think what you're having the latest chapter in the saga of an ongoing disease which is our government has grown so powerful so all encompassing so remote to bed and the power of government to fame or one group for people to another\nThat this is just the latest example of how our problem in politics is not too much money\nThat mind why it's another find where their word our problems too much power POW we are the founders never intended for the Supreme Court to be this powerful to decide things on the national scope with a single too often the five to four vote\nAnd as a result because all the power in my from on some issues especially the hot button social issues as concentrated the Supreme Court people will do anything to get that power anything and that's what we're seeing in the cabinet case [noise]\nWell that that is where we are because legislatures can legislate a chief executives can do executive things and pilots certain programs through presidents are powerful Congress is powerful but they are all I'm a news an air on by biased by the Supreme Court\nAnd and that means in just when their disagreements may win and that's just all there is to it or is it are we mistaken about that\nNow the Supreme Court is our auto I couldn't branch and as a result um and of course it's a life ten year by year term limits on the president we have um you know elections every two years in the house of representatives every six years in the Senate but on the Supreme Court\nEspecially because the it's only nine justices someone gets on the court for life\nOr that can be in a lifetime of your side losing five to four decisions we'd be a whole lot better off if you remember that you know the first but no Supreme Court nominee ever appeared before the Senate you to share a committee until Nineteen twenty five\nBecause the court wasn't that powerful now and in fact they didn't consistently started appearing until Nineteen fifty five now of course the Supreme Court is so powerful and so invasive in all of these areas of our life we treated like you know World War three whenever there's a frequency [noise]\nIt seems like a vat of horses out of the car and isn't it a ... and and

supremacy if you will is just a mess they are they're ... that term equal should suffice their co equal it meaning that that if the Supreme Court says something okay fine is\nIf a president and disagrees with it she can do it but then rather than chaos and breaking out the public and then figure out whether we like or don't like the president that ignores the Supreme Court and we can impeach our unlike him\nAnd there's a certain rough balance to that unlike what we had that you've just described which is this all powerful tribunal that just runs our lives on their whim [noise]\nWell I Know that Abraham Lincoln Andrew Jackson would occasionally talk about it during the Supreme Court [noise] um you know those were and they were going to make its case the civil war was around\nI Would much prefer the Congress exercise of power it's almost never used which is Congress can pass a law saying the court does not have jurisdiction over this area of our lives\nIn other words we're going to take back the power we created the constitution created the courts the court's powers that it for that we take back some of it we limited jurisdiction\nI'm OK untangling now [laughter] with ... with a win win potential a list of making it might be an old\nRare case of the Nineteen sixties you know the Supreme right out of nowhere said Madeline Marie O'Hare is right you can't have a Supreme

in public schools\n[noise] well there was a big move in Congress and I think that if uh the times have been different had liberalism hadn't been running in writing Supreme back then Congress could have said no this is not the court's jurisdiction we take it back so the decision as null and void\nI and that's okay that's satisfying up to a point because I saw Madeline Marie O'Hare to be as repugnant as a person a but but you couldn't someone rightfully step forward and say a while of\nDoesn't the pesky First Amendment when kennel legislature come in there and say they're like you can argue all day with her parents school as a First Amendment establishment clause violation or whatever but it doesn't that it's kind of envy argument before it begins\nWell again or what the what the court had said in the ... case was this was a ... as far as um [noise]\nA violation of the establishment of religion claws well if you disagree with that Congress can step in as the people's representatives and say no we have a different view\nOut again that hasn't happened it's not likely to happen but I'm simply saying that we're going to have to appoint a whole bunch more\nConstitutional is people who are judicial restraint people to the court because you know there are five people on the court if Kavanaugh is confirmed who don't have this expansive view of the Supreme Court's power rebel more humble view\nAnd I think that that's the best way to handle this put people on the court who don't want to be played comic rulers of the rest of us [noise]\nPrecisely
