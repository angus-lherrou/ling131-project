as anyone I did not expect it at all\nBut that's the case\nAs I told twelve hundred merely old Jews in LA last week by the way that talk is up on the Internet it's not on our website up but people should watch it\nOn the left and the Jews and it said that the largest to synagogue west of the Mississippi Valley best show alone in\nLos Angeles I'm Sorry largest conservative yeah that's right from

was the Republican Jewish alliance is that correct is that the correct the exact name yeah or or do that way but it it well it doesn't matter if you're a Jew or not\nThe it's the talk will be illuminating\nAnd [laughter] it's\nA I said the reason that the talk came to mind as I said at the beginning of the talk as of this moment anything can happen of course but as of this moment this president is a great president\n\nAnd he is he's a great praise be not only beyond expectations he is the is done more for what I value and others who are not on the left value including liberals but they don't know it because they've been so intimidated their whole lives into believing the right as the enemy\nBut as Alan Dershowitz said that left as the enemy of liberalism and I have said that over and over watched by video five minutes ... minutes differences between the left Mary mountain left or right sorry between liberal and left\nUp to ... dot com what's the video this week health care\nWhat's wrong with government what's wrong with government rowing healthcaregov is a timely\n[noise]\nOh\nWow is there a battle so it turns out I was right there was a civil war in the United states even the left now acknowledges if they're writing about it that's correct but as\nI said most of my life only one side was fighting now it may may be maybe capital was the final straw ... maybe while I reported last hour as the final straw\nThey ate a male winning the female bicyclist bicycle competition but uh the male is a transgender\nWoman she she identifies this person identifies as a female with a male body and no testosterone rules even\nThen the the the runners up from the Netherlands and the United states showed up on the platform they should live on behalf of women in fairness they shouldn't have showed up and people aren't fighters\nI'm not blaming those women\nThey're probably not probably so intimidated by the left\nThe ... the day you're no longer intimidated by the left to ask Dave Ruben they Reuben who's gay liberal and he is a he he understands the left see HIS Video while left the left it's all sort of prayer you\n\nIf you're a liberal who thinks that the left is your ally you have been brainwashed there was no rational ... there's no possible rational reasons it's purely an emotional decision\n\nWhat's going to be the final straw to have people say that the left is an elderly destructive force any one of these things to Capitol hearing\nThe the the the decimation of a good man by the Democratic party\nBy the way things happened so fast that is amazing fish it's so amazing how fast I predicted it in my column that I wrote on the Capitol hearing now they'll go to elementary school and sure enough\nThey did Stephen Miller the the president's ah eight and speech\nWriter now there's a report last week 'cause you've probably heard on this show or might have heard or should have heard\n\nHis third grade teacher so says one it was a a cookie kitty was what an odd\nBall go\nThey had there were no parameters you get to their moral parameters still exist for the left every every parameters destroyed\n\nThe concept that is central to Judaism and Christianity that is that if a person is turned their life around even assuming that this happened in high school the my argument was that he or she should not have been this hearing to begin with but it's no disrespect to the woman is simply I'm\nSorry we are not going to have all the basis of one person in high school have a hearing about a man's life\nThis is not how we run the United States Senate they were willing to go to California to hear her do realize how even for the Republicans fear of the left is greater than fear of God do you realize that they were going to go to California to a year or\n\nWhat if somebody I'm Serious want if somebody said you know uh when he was in ... when he was in tenth grade he held up a store what would you say\nSeriously that's a very serious thing with a gun he went with a gun and I could tell you I I I don't remember the store a nobody else remembers that happening are but I'm telling you I I Know what happened would there be a hearing\n\nWhy not is armed robbery or an inconsequential sin\n\nWe I watch on a daily basis to left destroyed the greatest country ever made and I don't know if the the these elections coming up\nWe'll be will be determinative on whether or not the left has gone too far because if they if they win the house or what you don't know chaos until you will know the next two years if they win the house they will

opponent is my opponents a Democrat that alone should invalidate you're voting for that person\nUnless you think that in fact the the the radicalism the society destroying ideas of the left should be dominant in this country you don't vote Democrat\nDemocrat that the stands for destroy the beef stands for destruction that's what the motto should be\nThe ... that the Republican motto should be that\n\nThe stands for destruction pay by\nThe way what happened with ah with Elizabeth Warren ... wanted to turn out she had a DNA test to show that she really is American indian and what what what are the turnout but I didn't I didn't see the results did you do do that you know the results what all day\nSomewhere between six and generations oh All right hey somewhere between six generations and

think\nI think it's already happened I think the fact that we don't talk about James Hodgkinson every single day and that most Americans most Americans\nHave no idea who James Hodgkinson is let's remember that the Steve ... was almost killed by a man who took a rifle in my hand go to a Republican majority baseball practice session\nBut when he was killed by those three brave kept to police officers what did they find on his body\nThey found a hit list list of solely Republican congressman that this individual was going to assassinate stunning that you know we forget all the people who are not field\nFried butter on ...\nSo maybe my question wasn't clear I Know that there will be individuals with tipped over right is there a point where Americans non left wing Americans will have their tipping point and say oh oh\nOh the last ... really is dangerous\nOh it's happened I think it's happened and I don't think it's Rochelle thank you I just look at the social media and in the last three weeks of the capital rang I was in Manhattan last week for the for the launch of why we fight\nAnd an older couple recognize me as I was waiting to get on the train back to D.C and they came up to me and they said we just quite people living our lives in in in Trenton New Jersey but we've had enough where we're going to vote we're going to support down ticket Republicans because what they did tobacco godly man\nThe absolutely right just individual was truly filthy and disgusting so yes I think we have reached the tipping point when you have\n... senators like Feinstein like a book like um Kamala Harris him cute the reputation of a man who who is white and the driven snow I think we've already arrived us\nWell they would say yes that's the problem he is wider than the driven snow [laughter] that's how sick it's become that that that's probably a a a a phrase that will be renounced but yes so you think storage so I Want to get this clear you think that I Do too\nI think that for a not for all Americans but for a very significant number of the Kavanaugh hearings worth tipping point to say the left and the Democrats have gone too far so that that is your position\nIf you if you own a ... year old who's sitting in some ivory tower and being brainwashed every day if you're just an average American and you look at the first five minutes of a cabin on hearing\nYou've had enough I mean ... ... that was the righteous indignation par excellence and I think that's the capitalist\nWell that's the hope that I so want to fight of ask you this prior to the cabin or hearing do you think that there was a tipping point before or you really do believe that sticky one\nNo I I I didn't I didn't see before ice\nWhile so this is dramatic to you what happened\nOh my gosh look at it\nIt it's in it's in the last chapter in my book it's wicked chambers and I I didn't know what was going to happen with Kavanaugh but afterwards I said my gosh we need to wake up because this isn't new\nWhen he stayed with Brett Kavanaugh I kept thinking oh there are even Republicans who would not have\nOh my gosh yes I mean and the way he handled it was so ... he was careful he was quiet and then when he saw all\nThe way this man had fought for his reputation justly\nAnd the way the good Americans not just you know hard core Reagan old but just the average Americans were incensed what did he do he stood up and he he highlighted the gaping for flaws\nIn for its testimony at his rally and he falls to the media to pay that ten second clip again and again and again\nI didn't think of it that way oh my gosh it was multiple refuse to cover it and we want to thank God for that that's right that's exactly right\nThe list this president I'll tell you another thing that is a capital a hearing revealed to be although I wasn't surprised this was not a revelation confirmation I should say more than anything else\nAnd this will really shock a lot of people to loads of man I think he has a good horse Donald Trump yes\nI can attest to this is what Dr phil left insane or they will never believe it whether it's\nIn writing the survivors of victims of the Parkland shooting to the west wing to talk to them or whether it's holding the hand of that the African American grandmother whose son had been killed\nThis is who he is and and the shocking thing that I can tell you because I worked for him and I you know I write down the influences in and why we fight is the ... the the evidence of this he or she is compassionate\nTo you as an American whether you voted for him or not he doesn't care he doesn't see skin color you don't see party affiliation if you're an American you deserve to be safe and to do this to prosper and fat or friend it's never going to be internalized by the hardcore left\nFinally a in why we fight your\nBook and again it is up a dentist Prager dot com my friends and you know if it's Sebastian Gorka wrote it it's pretty self recommending but I I have been saying for years\nAnd I think I was one of the first and I'm not saying this to brag on ... of seeing it because it it's now become common place or more so in any event that we are in a civil war how do you react to that\n[noise]\nComing from people who live through all my parents as children lived on the Nazi occupation than my father was torched it in prison by the communists [noise]\nI I find it difficult to use that phrase and I also remember that the ... the great this death toll in any war America's ever fooled wasn't in Korea wasn't in Vietnam wasn't in World War two but it was in our civil war six hundred thousand killed so I I have a kind of a block\nAgain I respect that so I was using shorthand my listeners ...

just an embarrassment I I I don't know what else to say it's that they were synagogues that went into the Jewish morning ritual of sitting shiver after Donald Trump was elected\n\nIs is a disgrace to

then you can you can see if\nMy point was\nThe left doesn't care about Jews the left doesn't care about women in the left doesn't care about blacks the left cares about power\nThe the the the the Jewish issue is obvious because there was no more significant issue to Jews who care about the Jewish survival than the survival of Israel and the Democratic party is now increasing the left is the center of anti Israel activism on earth\nIslamists and not all Muslims but Islamist Islamists and leftist of the most anti Israel forces in the world\nThat Jews would align themselves with with a

the United states has not had an ad in toppling of any government and the patch or even having any kind of an orange through the intelligence agencies\nJust to try to sway elections or to influence our one way or another\nYeah so I mean in other words the United states is a a world power\nThat has wide ranging global interests and we certainly have played a role in toppling of some very evil foreign governments including a foreign government uh in in Chile or under a Salvador Allende\nWhich actually I think we were justified in and taking some role and I know that very controversial but what does that have to do with this in other words if the United states is looking after our own interests uh we we oppose\nRussia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong in some
