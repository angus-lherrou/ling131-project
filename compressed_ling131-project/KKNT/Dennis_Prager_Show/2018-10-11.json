hundred of them across the country is that it's not that students are up her ... her ideas that they're not expose them at all the first place bravo and so I'm not quite what could I put together ... book or factually ... and it it it's in some ways it can create ocean but we have to show up\nFor ... for me how many students are searching for this message they had a desire to hear a different viewpoint and for whatever reason the universities have silent film and it's quite simple my could drop comes through is they hate the idea that there are other ideas\nAre for why not liberal very liberal out there and more of a law\nThat they are focused on silencing any opinion that might ... model Rick Rick I'm\nControl over the intellectual and ideological um viewpoint of a generation and so just just yesterday I spoke in South Florida we packed a room with a hundred students day before that we are ... thousand students at the University of Georgia\nWait a minute I thought whoa that's a big deal it really\nIs your weight you ... you wouldn't you wouldn't Candace or just you got\nYour tennis selling myself pressured the real draw so I kind of just\nGo oh you're just humble guy or pay I mean you're both girls but but that's very significant to forgive me I Want to underscore what you should be very briefly\nIssue my dear dear listeners is they have never heard our side it is not so much that they are from the left is just that they have no idea that there was a non molest way of approaching life\nExactly right and and what what I find that the work that pregnant university does and what we're doing on the ground is that when students are presented these arguments and logical factor\nUm non feeling sense if you will because every quarter or what they're going to ... and it's rooted in criminal and as you caught so many millions of people than is very few people care about how you feel we care about how you act\nAnd even more important than what you think and ... ... what you do and so we have found is that students that have any sort of ambition students that have any sort of sense of human decency or wants to do something in their life\nOn there's no way they can find the ... because the left is all about tribal identity politics is about\nYou can never you can never improve yourself you have to\nAndy Stern off for any sort of suffering that you might be being experiencing so a student that might have what some would say classical liberal ears are gay marriage or abortion they're leaving the left\nIn record numbers because if they didn't believe in some step on Supreme enterprise or they think that black only dormitories a bad idea then all of a sudden they're considered to be a right wing or or conservative as he got these universities and so the second part that I highlight in this book\nIs how radical the universities have become\nAnd it is important for your listeners to understand\nThe Democrat Party the sixties and seventies that JFK type Democrats those are considered to be fringe right wing radicals dial on college campuses if you believe that there are two genders you if you believe in free enterprise system if you believe America is the greatest country ever to exist those are considered fringe ideology and because of that\nYou know the ... some ways doing us a favor it allows us to recruit\nDecent minded students that\nQuite frankly say there's no way I Want to believe in this cultural Marxist world view that as being shut down my throat by my professors um and then the third point I make in the book which is really really important is how the conservative business community has subsidize the students are getting over the last couple of decades\nUm it is amazing to me he goes you walk you walk the halls of Harvard or Yale Princeton a majority of the big gifts that are given that these universities where the worst and Dr nation occurs\nIt's thanks to the giving of conservative successful business people that have allowed the Marxist to have unlimited amount of funds to indoctrinate\nGeneration after generation and so it's really a call to action to parents and two alumni stopped getting money ... university not give it to Craig or university that the different things stop giving money your actual school you went to first of all they don't need it\nSucking up they're going to use your money to go against your values\nAre program a generation to hate America and that that really needs to be reinforced that I go through all this certain levels are given how universities corrupt the or the ... process and how they perceive donors into thinking of going for the targeted\nOn initiative or program on a reality that goes for all the cultural studies or

electoral college vote or not even supported him\nWell I I I understand what people are talking about here with the electro compact and I am aware of it but part of what that means is that\nThe ah the states the various states to sign onto it or would be pledged to actually give them all the electoral votes in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote\nSo would suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant which\nMakes us better being arraigned no\nOkay did I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue stage very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nYou know the next time Republicans won the popular vote for president and lose the electoral college will go to the states
