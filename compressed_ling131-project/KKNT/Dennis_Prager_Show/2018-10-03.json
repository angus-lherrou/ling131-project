male and female one hour every Wednesday the second hour of my show\n\nKnown as the dentist praying or show features the male female our I think it's the most honest talked about men and women in the media I may be wrong and by the way if I'm wrong I Will acknowledge it I Want us to talk about I don't need\nTo be the winner of the honest talk sweepstakes but I think it is at this point and as I always point out to you my agenda is to understand men and women better to have them get along better I'm not a man than I Am out of woman fan I'm a good person fan\nOkay got that out of the way it's been such intensity and a male female issues in the news\nSo I decided to choose a seemingly lighter subjects I say seemingly\nBecause I think it goes to some interesting distinctions between men and women or an interesting distinction above it is not of the heavy duty variety\nOf an issue that is often on the table in our show and in American Life\nBut I think it's it's fascinating and I think he will enjoy it and I want to hear your take very simple the subject\nI have no I Know what came to me yesterday and I don't remember what engendered it\nSo here it's very simple would you prefer a gift or a gift card as a gift that it\n[noise] my theory is more men prefer a gift cards and more women prefer gifts and I have a theory as to why I have that theory\n[laughter] so [laughter] this is a\nTheory about a theory my theory is women if they receive a gift they see wow look at the thought\nThat was put into this uh getting me this gift that is really moving and beautiful or beautiful and therefore moving men think hey\nWhat a great deal I now have a hundred dollars to spend at X Y or Z that I didn't have before I could buy exactly what I Want\nFor me thank you I\nAm I speaking for you Mr producer\nBut now interesting to me because I Believe\nThat every one if every one of the three males affiliated with the direct presentation of the show tripled gee the living martyr and why have feminine side which\nI Do I Believe that and sure enough tripled jeeze feminine side came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card\nAfter I laughed at him for about five minutes we resume the conversation [laughter]\n[laughter]\nDid they have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they had cars that yes running water showers bats yes no no no no it's amazing even even automatic transmission\nThat at the amazing I Know I Know I Can't believe that question did they have gift cards what does that help is that hilarious they've gift cards no no they was invented when you were born oh my God this\nThis generation we keep him around as like a sort of a a a you know to stay in touch with what the with what the the new folk think anyway one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nAnd that is that that's the theory that I'm I'm working women love to and by the way there's no better or worse here this is a at all there there is no such thing in this regard I'm simply offering you may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nNow obviously or I wouldn't have said it but you know what it what is your take see and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add that so what is your Dennis prayers feminine side\nAnd I said it to these guys and the ... the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I think I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a so [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him shoot them uh dramas where you know action to action dramas man ... yes battle of high speed car chases\nThe guy shot him and this and and as it does do not exploit should such explosion [laughter] ... explosions [laughter] that was great I I I\nI turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion it it it does nothing for me but a romantic comedy I Am totally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation I mean I Love sleepless in Seattle I was riveted\nYes I Know that ... guys yes you don't even have to turn it off that's right triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you liked both correct that was your statement you like a romantic comedies and and the explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit but that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and the love women I have to wait and the ... the early days and Ken that's right and gift card that's correct you see Dr know you see that they know that there's a gift card slip to them that is exactly\nRight yeah yeah it exploded the gift card did explode [laughter] so everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what if it [laughter]\n\nSo I Am this this is a male female addition is devoted to Denis says Feehery on gift card versus gift I didn't ask my wife I ... I mean I I you know as well as I Know her\nBut I could see what do you think you know my wife very well what do you think or sue would would would answer\nIt's a tough one what would your wife answer I suspect the gift is yeah okay I I Do [noise] I Know there's a good argument in both I think if she likes the gift I think she'd be very touched\nBut I wouldn't be touched too if I liked the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting me that\n... are are very small you know who knows better what I wanted I that's my that's my rational bail brain talking\nSo let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift arrived sets a generous gift a hundred dollar gift\nThat somebody's spends they gave thought to it\nAnd and I know they gave thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing people think that you're getting them a gift certificate chose you didn't think he took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all [noise] listen don't couples to set up one of the call when they set up an account that are out of\nThe department store or a furniture store\nYou you know what I mean you know ... people no no come on guys you guys are so out of it you don't mean couples marrying set up a thing what is it called\nFree gave me one second Christine I feel bad for Christine could show me she feels Mel morally responsible you're not\n...

show\nAnd I know there are a great day in his greatest nation on God's green earth a great day when one of the great dividing lines in the United states is not only the dividing line between liberals and conservatives between people who think that Donald Trump can do no wrong\nAnd those who think he can do no right there is also in a binding dividing line\nThat continues to be a painful reminder of some of the more troubling aspects of America's past the dividing line according to race\nBetween black and white or or you can save between black people\nHave had a unique experience in the United states coming here originally as enslaved individuals and uh everybody else\nAnd uh there is a new book on this subject by someone who was in the past has been very very critical of black leadership his name is Juan Williams\nYou see him on the five very regularly on Fox News he's a regular contributor to Fox News his new book is called what the hell do you have to lose\nWhich of course there's a line from President Trump and the subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights a won congratulations on the book\nThat's wonderful and I appreciate you having me on because micro versus you know I think are intriguing topic it's a rich topic but especially for conservative audiences sometimes a very difficult you know kind of prickly issue uh but I think it's so important that's why I appreciate the opportunity\nWell one of the things that I liked about your book is you give proper credit or to the Republican Party in particular to Senate minority leader at the time Everett Dirksen for the landmark civil rights bill well let's let's start there because one of the things you remind people of is how profoundly\nThat civil rights bill that was passed a with very strong Republican support in Nineteen sixty four changed America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act that fixed before so that you know we'd go through everything housing education voting rights\nAre and you come to the idea that this would not have passed unless you had Everett Dirksen who came from southern Illinois an all white pretty much district\nAre peak in Illinois it was fun downtime where if you were a person of color you are not welcome there after sundown better get yourself out of there there's going to be trouble um\nAnd you know you ask about family I think in these terms my father who was born Nineteen oh to Michael standing on a corner\nAnd you would say that man's life\nIs really dictated by his skin color in terms of his educational opportunities employment opportunities where he can live where you can buy a house where you can rent an apartment all of this dictated by skin color and then you come to me I'm sixty four is born Nineteen fifty for Michael\nAnd uh it's just an incredibly different world live I live in a world where Jeff what you know I've seen not only the first black secretary of state the first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff I've seen the first black\nBillionaire you know people like Oprah Winfrey Bob Johnson or I can go on a record number of blacks and Congress black mayors\nThis we are black senators it's a you know I I joke in there that you know my dad if he was aware of my daughter and I felt bad my daughter has a Georgetown Law degree\nHe played with Georgetown Law doesn't except by people well that was true to the sixties but she does\nToday and of course I could say hey bad you know look at me here I Am having lunch at the White House and he's ... who's the other black guy and I thought oh that's the president Ronald bombing that you don't live in a different world you live in a different universe Advil there has been front and then this progress made in this country\nPresident Trump has invited to the White House no okay would you go if he did no\nSee I don't get that I just in the end of the same thing with with some of the um in other words like you I I Want President Trump I Want Republicans generally to\nUh be a more broad based party not just to be the party of older white guys are to be a party and reaches out to everybody because otherwise we have no future and uh so why why if the president invited you would you not go to the White House\nWhere I think he's insulting condescending and and so lacking in any sensitivity or knowledge of how American history you know the central to American history has the story of black history\nSo when he says things like calling a black woman Omarosa a dog or calling another black woman a congresswoman Maxine Waters who is a tremendous Trump critic but he says extraordinarily low IQ when he engages in politically\nOr you know advantageous tactics I guess with his base like saying the first black president wasn't born in this country and then he uses that\nTo elevate his profile I think this man is just about the fighting in the country about feeding people racial hate and I'm not going to be in his company\n[noise] okay [noise] ... when you say that ... your your knows he's going to be ... you don't expect that he is going to be removed from office do you\nI don't know I mean I don't know what Mueller has in terms of the Mueller probe if that's what you're talking to\nYou know I'm just talking generally he's going to be president for another two plus years two years three months\nAnd um [noise] okay ... during that time period\nAnd and this is a part of the the challenge for your book and I let me back up for a moment because a lot of people may not know but one you wrote a courageous book the guts you lots and lots of attacks on the left it was a book called enough the subtitle is the phony leaders\nDead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black America\nAnd what we can do about it correct and one of the things you talked about was\nHaving um black leadership to talk more about achievement and a little less of a constant sense of grievance aren't aren't aren't you coming into that trap that that you yourself described in your book enough\nNo in fact I Wish that the president President Trump\nWould celebrate the idea of black achievement and that for friday instead of you know always talking about black people in the way he says oh you know they live in circumstances worse than Afghanistan their neighborhoods still with violence and poverty and joblessness and bad schools I'm thinking wait a second\nThat's your description of black American twenty Eighteen\nI mean right now Michael forty percent of black Americans are in between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars an additional twelve percent between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nSo you can see a majority of black America is either in the middle class or beyond\nIs one of the prime achievements of the civil rights era in addition I say obviously the growth of black political voice in power as part of American society so these are tremendous achievements\nSo I'm all about looking at how people who were faced with such disadvantage and society slavery legal segregation ongoing racial bias and all the rest nonetheless\nHave thought out the American dream and have kept it alive and and want to succeed you know like the Jefferson slogan they want to move on up right\nAbsolutely good stuff but this president instead he focuses on the twenty percent\nWho who are in poverty disproportionately young people and kids often times because of broken families on the like and he makes that out to be the entirety of the black part like they're all gonna mug you were going to take your job or are they going to ruin your schools I think it is just so deceitful and dangerous because again it is racially divisive\nOkay I again I I ... some of the same uh comments by President Trump and gestures by President Trump I've been highly critical of on this radio show 'em because I'm not one of those people who believes that President Trump can do nothing right uh nothing or um have but I\nAlso I'm\nA believer not one of those people things President Trump can do nothing wrong and I'm not one of those people things you can do nothing right\nAnd he must be doing something right because we've covered on the air before they're a bunch of polls and it's not just Rasmussen there six major polls that show that his approval rating in the black community has been going up\nAnd largely that's because we do have a blanket unemployment rate that has the lowest ever measured that people have been making the kind continuing the kind of economic progress that you're talking about right\nFirst of all the polls that you're talking about is a poll backed by its own admission has too few black people polled so once you get is a a distortion the reality is there and I find that this is so troubling about\nBut what I Am saying is let's not be in different because the idea that if you look at the white middle class in this country are so much of it was built behind things like the GI Bill behind things like building aid to mortgages so that people could buy homes in this country and don't forget\nAgain ... job training educational opportunity after World War two and that was all done again I'm going to segregated basis so I mean government has a role to play\nBut that's not going to the it seems to me the be all and end all in terms of economic empowerment it's stuff that you don't punish people on the early\n... looking at it and I I think I think every ... every poll people good well should certainly agree on that as being people of goodwill you played a courageous role during the Clarence Thomas confirmation fight in in defense of Justice Thomas and and I know you were a supporter of his confirmation\nI'd do you think that history is repeating itself to some extent in terms of the the kind of attacks that have been ... level the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee and the comics case it was a meter hill and\nYou know we were very slow to come out but then there are many of the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they dismissed that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leak and then it came out so it's very similar because we look for after four she found a letter to a congressman ... many makes its way through guy and Feinstein\nAre and then her name is weak or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... ... it doesn't seem similar to me is a level the charge I don't think that anybody that\nAh you know Clarence Thomas ... on a ...\nYeah but my one there's a difference of touching the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do when he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission he was a government official and he was already a law graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh\nHas to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYou are but I think that the larger issue here is ... er of character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because they you know the whole presentation of himself as a bird in a choir boy these are ... book is the was and then all of his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loved the party's own talent\nOr gain weight ... if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really monitor for ... Washington D.
