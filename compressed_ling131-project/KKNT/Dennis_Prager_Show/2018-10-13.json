they work on domestic an import cars most gas and diesel\nAnd they're really good guys so you can count on the fact that they're going to treat you write treats you fair at the courage I Seventeen and bell on the north east corner of ice Seventeen and about [noise]\nSo we talked about State Farm or we got anybody on the phone skill six oh two five oh wait zero nine sixty oh you woke me up market not long suffering so nevertheless if you got a car question six oh two five await zero nine sixty six of two five awaiting zero nine sixty and You're welcome to college we've got five lines open and guilt is wide awake\nWhen it comes to repair and cars I think you'll agree we got to have some communication with customer lots of communication and we're going to ask lots of questions what where when and how I that's my words and if you come in and say my car's overheating that's really not good enough for us\nIs it the gauges that Lincoln water as it says or steam coming out of there\nAre you constantly adding water D.C water on the ground what what I Am I go out on a limb but I don't really care I'd much rather head on for a while you don't fall I Know I don't care about that I'd much rather have a female in front of me yeah because a daily tell me about the symptoms and the guy's going to tell me how to fix his car\nHe's always going to put a few ... no no no I Need to know why yeah because if we're going to work off year look at somebody said it yeah yeah or YouTube university\nOn my ... yeah I saw the check\nEngine like test on YouTube and that's just what it is and I want this X. replace yeah right\nExactly we had a lady come in and so he can and she said you know I Need to have my car in any Andy said okay what are we looking for and she said oh just come to a guy and he said well no what are we looking for oh just tell the mechanic to drive it they'll know\nAny any says ... empire is it a noise is it oh just drive it down now and she said no we really need to know what we're looking at the camera you're noise in our noise might not be the same or whatever the problem is finally she did tell and the but it was like pulling teeth and that's unusual\nVery unusual that you can get the women the clock in the lobby\nWhere you know you get them to mimic that noise skin when somebody comes in and has annoys I'll say you know does it sound like a baby in a tin can or marvel at a coffee cup deserve some doesn't marble in the coffee cup bang up fast and hard\nJust to maybe like a piece of like a penny piece of metal like your cookie sheet banging on the inside of your oven or whatever it happens to you know try to take a separate them a little bit well not only about a lot of you know you got to get a lot of information ... ...\n... a lot of information a lot of words is not an awful lot of times and\nAnd ... is actually talking with first hand knowledge because it's been ... his brain has been compared to BP's marble\nSo let's go to a you know what I found that when I got it All right I don't know if he's in Marvel's\nRemember that Tom ... the bees and marvels at work like until I came from All right you got a caller had a cat is alive guy [laughter] or go cuts or how are you buddy\nI'm doing good topic to entirely different vehicle that you can handle that\nAs long as you're quite go right ahead\nOkay first of all my panic button and then I might that might dobbin for frontier\nLocked up going to go to a couple of weeks ago and I bought a condensed or for it when I wrote it because those do not come without remembering anymore you get the ring separately\nSo I'm kind of mad about that\nBut it also the second issue let's go to the second issue will comment on both of them\nOkay that can make it to find your car on\nCouple of years ago I took it to a shop and they replaced connector here and and the total connector that go\nOn things and one of them were stranded or anything for Easter thrift shop poor Sean Sean but\nYeah that that special little green to get the\nRight time and find reliable you learn what can I ask a question ... you know there's a lot of it there's so many components to that question\nYou take the second one the second one yeah that's what I'm going for a second after we see those happen all the time out here especially in Arizona because they're they're hot that the plastic expands contracts and so on\nSo at that mileage that year it's just going to become an are they a good part sure there are a good part when they're obviously like everything when their new but when you get a part like that and it gets bread all over the years\nIt's just one of the functions of cars at where\nWe have lots of those problems on cars a lot of the board we got cars out there that have really crappy parts but we can't buy them any place other than in one place and so and so but the good news is a place like who's that who's the company\nThat makes replacement parts that are ten times better than the original parts and it the one of their minds is called help\nDormant Dharma Dharma Dharma and makes all kinds of stuff nobody else mix and so you get in their catalogs and you could find it so the idea of of those clips I'm quite sure there's something already out there that we can buy the question about us buying it is is\nWho's making it is there some guy in Cleveland, Ohio that's got a little machine shop in his in his thing and selling them\nAnd he wouldn't be around to guarantee the performance of his part\nIf we had a a bill it aluminum piece that you would never have to replace made on a ... a machine and with diamond dials him we're going to say this park for seven hundred and eighty dollars and it's never going to wear out no snow there has to be heart solve\nOkay the AC compressors concern they don't come with a whole range for a reason that extra and that's all there is to it it's no different than when you buy a hose it doesn't come with clams\nWhen you buy a fuel pump it doesn't come with hoses and sometimes the float it doesn't come with those so you have to ... I mean that's just the luck of the draw you you you're not going to get somebody to go into your transmission and replace everything ... every single parts\nOr something the seals deal rings the clutches just breaks the springs everything's going to cost extra so in our world and we don't get anything for free\nRight and that's it I mean we buy everything that we have to pay for your car so we by over ... separately and stuff like that\nNever less sick so to five away zero nine sixty six oh two five await zero nine sixty if you'd like to join the conversation if you have a question but getting back real quick to the people on the front counter I just I Can't tell you what we said all we say all the time\nJust because you have an oath to censor code tells us that that problems in Ohio and you have to find the city the street and the street number\nNow per se I that's yup the exactly percentage wise what portion of oath to censor codes in your shop\nActually necessitates the replacement of an oath to censor as opposed to all the other things that can cause you to censor it to be the messenger honestly you know let us know how\nHe lie lie you know I'm going to lie about it honestly or just honestly [noise] less than ten percent and were twenty five percent and I'm given myself a little slack\nBecause flood field filtered vacuum lakes and they just last week a exhaust leak out the converter and anything that causes it to run extra rich or extra lean anything that causes that correct\nAnything in ... I was given you say one I say we are All right All right\nYou can have one nephew filter plugged up causes Lincoln brings aptly okay plugged exhausted like I said I'm not the computer now your turn okay I feel pressure regular this leak and making around rich and rich up back in ... okay ... making it run\nRich I'm a hold on just a minute we've had some we're oh\nWe had somebody tired twelve volt line and then to an oath to censor that's supposed to talk with busy road to one exactly and they tied to twelve volt which makes it say holy mackerel were running rich so the computer kept trauma down the field to the motor would run\nThe computer's controlling the faucet and this goes oh you're running rich you are a lot of fields shuts off the faucet well this guy spent and he owns a shop and I'm not going to tell you it is but it's a diesel shop in his defense\nHe spent about working on gas motors\nNow you okay eleven hundred and six okay eleven hundred dollars and Eddie found that thing within about an hour and a half so he says what do you want me to do go find out where the wire supposed to go and I said no just run a new one this is a Seventy seven blazer and we're not pulling\nSo we ran a brand new one from the computer straight to the to censor the cart problem solved or done and I think we charge them a little less than five thousand dollars to get a caller All right we've got a caller who's that guilt de de de de good morning to you how can I help you finding\nA\nCoyote question okay I have a problem here I have a Nineteen Ninety five Honda Accord care and it has far higher ... brand tire half Iraq but my question is\nShould I recently had asked they have and if so can you recognize that tire or in the west valley\nNo we tell them no matter what the tire looks like you put a set of tires on that's a K but where is the line\nThe line in the sand yeah according to Michelin okay if it's over by one day you're or what over the date coat on the tire okay plus swap plus what they didn't give a plus why\nNot ... the ... the tire was born in ten okay what's the line [noise] what's the line that ... ... is it two thousand seven oh in the car the car with ... is a two thousand Seventeen and what's the timeframe on our retire [noise]\nI'll save you save me there is no there is a big fight going on right now because they want to cut they want to ... passenger cars out at ten\nTen hours that's already a discount policy they said the failure chances are just huge after ten years so discount tire won't even touch patch or do anything but replace the ten year old tire will not it says on their website were not touching the ten year old tire\nKill select motor homes five to seven\nMhm that's now here's the problem the attorneys don't want an expiration date on the ... they get to sue tire companies in garages all day long\nYou should have known as tier was bad oh well I didn't have the crystal ball that week Blackwell at it so that's what's going on so the attorneys say we don't want any expression on a tire mhm the tire companies go no we want an expiration date on the ... because we can sell lots more tires\n... right yeah we got the attorneys in the insurance companies that are fighting about ... or ... I'm Sorry the attorneys and the tire makers that are fighting about this\nNow commercial truck you probably know this I think you do as a commercial guys run a hundred thousand miles here so we're not concerned with the commercial guys besides a lot of them have recaps anyway\nWell you've got stairs ... the term for ... years and drive right so Dr tires are a lot of times they'll take the stairs and\nPut them into that yet and you're right you're right [noise] most everybody the world the industry's kind of taking those lines and moving them around but I'll tell you what we're doing we're doing five to seven on RVs period we're doing ten years on passenger car and then we're not touching them the other day we had to commit a lawyer\nCome in and he had an interview one fifty nine good years which is the biggest piece of\n... the whole wide world\nAnd he had a full set in there and I and he was a customer of mine I said you're not leaving without tires if I have to put a full set a tires on your car your not leaving because his family and his mother and his father all those people are riding that motor home so he did buy a set of tires but you know what we did on those good years we drilled two inch holes in the side while so those\nTired or should we never use you know in the end ever be used again never it's not really an expiration date on their parents' debate that the tire ways made just so people know that ... ... ...\nAnd the code is often times we buy a brand new tires but by the time they go from the manufacturer to the warehouse the warehouse to the distributor the distributor to the installer the installer to the customer\nYou can have a ... year and a half old by the time you get it right so it's not something that we have that control over we got a caller can ... and and I think we covered GEDs question because I didn't do a good job the first time and guilt tell us who's on the phone Dave is on the phone David good morning to you how can we help you\nPay you a blender buys you\nSorry sorry [laughter] I Do a version of LA oh Dave would you I I needed to talk to you can you give me your phone number on your email address and your home address [laughter]\nLicense plate number driver's license all day and I'm just if I can get a cell phone number I'm going to afterwards I'm going to say this guy knows more about cars than anybody in the world you can call him directly and that's not going to die anyway he likes he he's he's a\nHe wakes up late and he stays up late okay to take some calls around ... am I have a go buddy go\nOkay I've got you know I buy older cars yep I've got in Ninety seven\nOldsmobile eighty eight okay wonderful car less than a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it okay so it really was a Sun City car okay and the automatic antenna failed okay\nSo my friends from church who is a certified mechanics uh went over picked up an after market antenna K. and install it goes up and down perfectly when you shut the car and turn it on [noise] but\nI got you know am I got them but I got no am\nWhat time is going to tell you what's going on with the Tom go right ahead supplier\n... the the the cable itself it goes from the antenna\nTo the radio is disconnected or broken it's got it's got a separation and you will not get at the intent of sucked up and am signal\nIf the tennis disconnected you will not get an AMC Eagle rock you'll get an F ethics at home ... ... am so somewhere along the line he did something wrong\nSo there is there is a is this something that came on they after market antenna any attaches to the existing go out to you\nKnow it's just a collects cable that probably wasn't attached to the antenna itself or I mean the question to answer your question will be\nAnswered once we fixed the thing but that that an antenna I think the mass comes with the fishing line inside of it well\nYeah the wind comes in so the antenna goes up and down exactly that's already got it collects cable that comes off the antenna shredded a cat that it plugs into the original radio and or some radios ... or ... or send vehicles how the cable that comes from the radio out to wear a connection would be at or underneath underneath the fender plug it in and you're out\nUnderneath the rear right bender in the trunk\nOkay well we know that we know that the bottom line is is that you gave us great symptoms no I Am\nWell it's an antenna problem so somebody has to go back in there and figure that out but what he's talking I think the masters what he replaced with the fishing line and folks let me explain that to think of a fishing pole okay so we have fishing line that's about the size of spaghetti\n... and this fishing line goes in the mass of the antenna so when we wind it up the the antenna collapses and when we turn to crank the other way on the fishing pole the antenna goes up\nSo for those kinds of people on the part of their maintenance that nobody ever does accept us old guys is to take some WD forty ...\nOn another ad in the ... the inside of a more of the cable ... the antenna goes down in to the right by the end of the lowest part of the intern right\nYeah so the all of that is normally happen because if you have big huge bugs hanging off here in town and when the antenna goes to collapse it's not exactly a smooth transition we don't do that anymore the fishing line stuff but anyway ... somebody has to go in and fix it body bag when he's\nTrying to figure out what he needs view that's why we call it new guy\nWell you tell in this till you're certified mechanics son that I had a MSN before you started this and now I don't have a em so you need to go in there and figure that out\nWell as we've had that discussion already\nWell if you have that certified mechanic David we will take his certification away\nThat he came out of one to ten scale what's this Thomas [laughter]\nAnd wind [laughter] well I'm not a one to pin scale and it's a new one the U.S so it's not ... you know oh is it that's the other way yeah yeah yeah yeah I thought one was the best known that no one is the easiest thing had is the most difficult\nOh gosh almighty where you've been married ... years now and I learned from the vast you said earlier [laughter]\nAll right if I didn't know how to do this until I got here this morning hours right okay all righty nevertheless David good luck to you buddy and thank you very much for your call six so to find ways zero nine sixty six so to five voids ear and I said and we've got another caller gill who who can we talk that will be Doug and Doug good morning morning Doug\nOh among a lot lots to talk to you thank you have an old clip God's room bingo on what the human\nCost Saddam is the field feels that I see a lot of rounds on the road around here I Am there's I've heard that in order to change the steel filter you have to drop tank\nThat would cure for them\nI don't know neither does Tom I don't let me let me let me Tom\nIf this was a tough son of a gun if this was in some YouTube thing that somebody put on the Internet we would have heard about it by now we would know that a fuel filter instead of men and a thirty dollar labor charge would be hundreds of dollars labor charge so we're we're unclear but I'll tell you what I Do have for you\nI have my I have not heard of this I haven't gotten any ... nobody's around us in the shop and so they don't [laughter] a dodge has to have the tank pulled down right there are some vehicles out there though but I don't think\nDodge just went up but their symptoms associated with it so if we have this intake fuel filter then it's going to run lean all of a sudden when I vote to code and it's going to have a lot of parents are like sixty it'll do sixty but not sixty two so my answer to you is this do you have a pencil handy\nYes okay right down this number Tom give me your number\n[laughter] your cell phone numbers show similar numbers\nThat it's just as six though two three one ... no no six to nine nine to five four seven eight give us a call us talk some more about it and\nAnd your car guy right that I did it has not only major I wasn't even really know who's next Monday Dan Dan good morning to you that is that you\nGot an ... I Know you're sorry\nA commercial was starting to go out I got the whole thing replaced before starting to go out to work trucks get a job for me for many years but I got a problem with [noise]\nMoving around [noise] shit on the shoulders surely nothing\nWithout looking [noise] Charles ... block of ice [noise]\nTrying to watch certain sauna everything looks like a jerk light on\nOkay go on when the air conditioning unit was installed they put a component uncalled of an uh an accumulate her\nAnd I'm not again Larry maybe they are gay but let's just assume that they did for this for the benefit of the other shop there is a low pressure switch that when it when you lose refrigerant out of the system it shuts the compressor off so it doesn't burn the compressor up by email fluent in it\nIf that you can adjust it that switch or bypass it so that no matter what happens the compressor will always run when it runs all the time and it's full refrigerant it's going to freeze up the system and then you'll you could have snow coming out of the dash\nAnd and there's a lot of other thing I don't know if this has got an or if it's too boring and expansion valves I think it's got an or if it's something that's more of us to have and therefore if this to\nMe is okay well here's the problem is that the compressor die a a violent death\nNo I was placed before ... ... before that happened\nAlready well I think that we should go in and sucked the free on out of it save it clean it put it back in but I think the office to would be a good one now here's the tea where does he I start\nAnd stop because if it starts and stops at the office to then we've got the office to plugged up because it's supposed to meet the slow the flow of refrigerated through the evaporated which is buying the glove box\nShut the place that it'll turn the or if it's true and what I saw that and there was a little better but what do you feel without down and check and start to form at that point\nBut it's hard to say it was a block away by the time I found it first started happening\nOkay well the ice is an indication that we have a blockage\nSo we're going to me the flow of refrigerant code refrigerant him through the evaporate or\nAnd so we're going to me to the back side of it so we are going to ten coal free on through the operator and then if it gets too cold we open up the door and let some more surgeon through and if it gets too hot and we closed the door and bring it back up so one way or another really this is something that he gave you\nSo the diagnostic process um should be under warranty and it's and I'm sure you've said you've done business with him for a long time\nIt will be under warranty work for for being with a chance to go to let's see if we can find out what it is a possibility\nAlways is that there's one in ten chance that it isn't anything to do with his but he still has to identify before he can say it's not my problem is identified thank you

don't I don't think the astronauts\nYeah I don't think they have stress stress came out with front will drives that's where really starts ... was front will drives but if you're talking shock absorber as a full set a shocks dependent on the quality of the shocks is two to three hundred bucks I\nWould not on the labor right yeah well it's a if if this car has stretching and they're going to be about across the border on most every car with a new line ...\nA pop Warner dollars four hundred and fifty dollars is that the labor you're talking about the late okay alright labor and I'm ... I'm going to you because we're in general you know maybe we're in that line of of ... okay three to four three twenty five to four fifty\nNo not in that as a matter that's where I got to cover every inch yeah but here's the deal you need to verify if it's droughts I could be wrong and I've been wrong before because my wife will testify to that but I'm pretty sure Ninety nine Malibu so rear wheel drive I'm pretty sure that thing doesn't have droughts and I'm pretty sure we're talking about you know Monroe or whatever she had all\nThis other delayed reaction but my I'm never on my wife will tell you okay [laughter] anyway that's uh and and you know really that's going to be one of those things that wait a minute we forgot\nThat we knew what wait a minute wait a minute I gotta say something before you know when they found that let's say in it at all find find I don't really\nKnow what I'm really and truly she's got Seventy seven thousand miles on it would we put shocks on that even if they were bleeding blood tests Seventy seven thousand miles link that car poppies with mileage hasn't been driven very much per year\nAnd and and they're in a in the absence of tire where in the absence of tire where I knew now we know your mom's not going down the freeway at a hundred miles an hour right\nShe doesn't do the freeway\nOkay All right so then you know I'm not quite sure I'd spend two or three hundred\nDollars a hundred miles on the side streets\nWell yeah that doesn't matter [laughter] anyway I get\nA second opinion and to get a second bad if you want to do it but by the U.S unless you have a reason I'm not quite sure if my mother who had that I'm not quite sure even if I costs that are out to ... I'd ... I'm not quite sure that\nWe just put a put a new set of four tires on just because the other ones were ... you know Dr ... issue though she's\nAlready has got to go first to crochet\n... thank you very modest ivory you're up next I re how can I help you\nBought it morning I'm not a note that says up your guys ally but I've got a ... a tractor a farm tractor\nThat's a gravity feed tank on it you know gas tax removed at a replacement cages to put it back there is a pool underneath that did collect some Ross stuff ally put it back from just handle in it\nNow the tractor was starting so we play suck oil like a bouncer aren't sun and the bugs and and I ran fire but now it seems like it starts right up round is great for three or four suck outspent\nCompletely stops that you know I checked the fuel lines I rely on them and said let's go to the carburetor say that there are still coming out and there's a couple of small Scrooge you can take off and I saw fuel coming out of those ... it's getting fuel\nBut now it I I don't know what to do if there could be condemned sure what else they'll only run for three or four seconds run a great thrill away so I got them just slowly cups all\nAll right well the real question is Parker fuel that's the real question we got no choice there so why don't you get a a a propane can\nAnd a man when it gets run and I want you to open up the propane valve a little bit in the ticket right there and that that one or two barrel carburetor you got on your tractor and if it runs for a long time it's a field delivery problem\nBut if it's still dies then it's not feel so yes okay now a ... job is to keep the points from our gain and keep the points to burn nice if you put points in it you should have put a condense or in it but you can look at this point okay and I was\nA matter of fact that was why wouldn't run before was like and that's where we got a bad kid that's all right but another one that trouble or not now then it started out Rand fine but then all of a sudden after or you know how they run out of it were like I said start shutting off\nOkay but did you all points in and it was the condense or a yes\nOkay the groundwater that goes from the side of the distributor case to the to the uh breaker plate isn't in their ... yeah\nI uh work or a alligator clap and what a from a the battery straight to the positive side of the oil ship that was a problem and it was a failure would stop\nWell we're still to spark and feel I mean that's what we have to determine and as far as going to be pretty simple points can denser distributor cap\nAnd oil I mean that's all that's it that or the ignition switch he he eliminated that because he went from the battery to the hot side of the coil okay but if\nI have a resistor in it that'll tractor I don't think we're going to is it a six fold or troubled system\nThat sexual\nOkay I'm not quite sure we'd have a resistor but it could it could have a resistor somewhere\nJust going to drop the ball six to eight or nine volts to the to the middle east if it's a sexual is going to drop down oh okay I'm Sorry Iraq come on get on the bitter right after he writes six is going to be less than six but spark and feel and the answer to be honest with you with us gray haired guys wouldn't be afraid of that tractor at all\nIf you can tailor shop then see everything that has points and get an answer everything that has a computer everything that has feeling Jackson is we don't understand the fundamentals and so it's not going to be that hard but we know that the distributor is the trigger for the points in the points open and close the coil and the coil provide spark so this could be a bad coil wire for all we know\nSo I don't know or\nTell I'm not at a nap but right now to buy some parts and I was going to get another ... that's what does that went that before\nSo I'll I'll do that and then I'll take the propane that say about work so I did however there are dangers that I put down I take back up yet\nBut the one gauge that goes to the water temperature not being a mechanic I did know and I caught it because I was too hard to get through and I figured well I'll just built a lot of a temperature gauge and the oil one I have the guts to\nSo I cut those shut them off I don't think that would have been a problem but\nWait a minute wait wait wait a minute is that tractor positive ground\nOh boy you got me on that I\nNeed to check to see if the positive battery cable is going to the ground on the motor because when you put those gauges and if you wire them as a negative ground that could be an issue well\nNot only that is the old tractors sometimes had a needle on that would hit ground the ignition system yeah when they overheated and on the low side of the ... pressure right so Murphy gauges what they were called okay thank you for that 'cause I didn't know that but the Murphy gauge it prevents you from overheating under run it out of the oil that could be something that will depend on that\nAgain though it's far can feel so it's got back back back to that so anyway where do you live where do you live I live in a book by outcome [noise] okay ah [noise] give me some cross streets\nA wouldn't be a new river road and saying okay well I Know Kurtz down there to Seventeen\nAnd fix that I mean if you if I buy the obviously you're going to have to you're not going to drive down the ice Seventeen but if it's if it's attracted a fits on a traitor and you decide to take it someplace than my advice you would be Kurds that I Seventeen and balance those two young ... that worked there Eric and Jeff there mark said um said they don't have a prayer in hell affects them is\nOkay alright ... like hey I lay down the gauntlet fall I certainly\nAppreciate your your health alright Eleanor I'll give them a try\nAll right thank you very much Dr ... thank you [laughter] well anyway we talked about diagnosis early in the shows ... somebody called in to write a lot of people do right so we have a vehicle come and like you have\nThis strange one customer calls up and says every time I come to a stop my cars idling into a car at three thousand are BMI ... shops and they can't fix to shut the car off\nStarted up in neutral put it into drive and take off from every stoplight mhm so they bringing him are looking at it and we fixed it and we're trying to figure out how to build a customer for removing the floor [laughter] talking about off the top of the gas pedal yeah the bottom of the gas pedal homeless aren't shop\nWell I I can I Know shops that would charge three hundred for that\nYou know and I know shops that wouldn't no charge that now that I had a ... ... what what what about removing rice from trunks no no no no let's get back to the same on here's the issue if she's a longtime customer\nIn ain't going to cost her die off Miller's shops if she walked in and took up thirty one minutes of my time at the front counter telling me everything that she's ever put in that car 'cause that's what her husband told her to do\nAnd he was still working you saw during a performance is at that age and did for a few more years I think uh I think back to my own family history my grandmother\nLived to be a hundred and three and your grandmother yeah that was pretty unusual yeah I really was um and she was really quite active until she was about Ninety eight Ninety nine\nAnd she was a bit younger than my grandfather and and my grandfather um had a job at a pinch and thank goodness he worked with the railroads you had a pension that went over to my grandmother\nWhen he passed ... my grandfather passed it are fairly normal aging you I Believe it was sixty eight or sixty nine\nRight which would have been normal for your grandfather\nRight my grandmother was about ten years younger so she was about fifty eight when he passed which means that she was in retirement but pretty much by herself\nFor over forty five years that's really long the the the beautiful thing for her was this year that railroad pension otherwise you know I I don't know how she would have been able to to manage naturally not not that she was ever rich but she she was able to get by with that country\nThat's a very important and that's why people today as they look into retirement and look back at either parents or grandparents and think oh my grandparent are my parent\nHad maybe both had this pension Mart they lucky and then some of them even had Social Security in addition to their pension gosh that was easier will what ... what will I Do how well they replicate that type of this up security and retirement\nWhere they seemed comfortable I Know my my own mom and my dad both said that they felt like they were better off in retirement than when they were working because of having pensions and Social Security\nOne big area that I think is going to affect so many people in retirement in their older age is a\nHealth care in long term care healthcare concerns\nYou know I Would agree with you and there was a period of time where getting I'm paying attention to this and particularly a lot of attention being paid to purchasing long term care insurance and\nA while it was offered in the workplace and if it wasn't offered by employers it was really encouraged for employees\nTo get there on long term care insurance and when that went away and the government was no longer encouraging that we just saw it leaves people's minds and so\nAnd so a big challenge for people who are retiring is to think ahead and say All right\nI you know when I reached that eighty five or whatever age maybe it won't be until nineties\nBut at some point if I follow normal life cycle I'm going to be more frail I'm going to need some assistance\nWhere's that money going to come from and\nThat's an important question and we'll important yes maybe some people in recently and they had taken care of that while they were working and as we went to work on their plan I have to tell you sing Claire it was such a relief I thought oh they have this component handling it didn't weigh on my mind and I was working with them and putting their plan together\nAnd I in fact I told them several times or you know how great that was at that component was done and we could focus on some of the others that they were kind of ... at MIT at because I it's it it weighs on my mind a lot because I've done this so long that I have people who\nNeed care for short term long term that you you know you there's usually a transition from being very healthy to passing on and so and that transition period which years\nAgo a Mayo Clinic would call this final chapter costs more money where all that money come from\nAnd we've talked about this a lot and I think I get why it is such a big issue for you because you can put together a pretty good plan and I saw a plant or somebody can come in and they've got some good things in place but nothing can derail a plan faster than a health issue\nAbsolutely so it's interesting because\nPeople become risk averse you know more risk averse than when they were thirty so they'll have people say well gosh when I was thirty five this would be how I invest it and now I'm In retirement or close to retirement I just don't feel like I can do what I did when I was thirty five and yet\nThey will then leave and not be risk averse to leaving themselves exposed to this potential\nHuge expense that cutting the rain everything that they've been very careful to put away and so there has to be a balance on all sides and the protection side in other areas besides making sure that your um that your money is in a place to where you will do what you expected to do\nBecause your house doesn't always do what you expected to do\n[laughter] no it does however there are some things you can do for your long term health and a lot of people looking at retirement are saying I Need to be making some changes\nNot just a him getting long term health care insurance\nYou or something like that but just an overall lifestyle I Need to be exercising more I have to have a positive outlook I have to go to the doctor every now and then for checkups and not just think that I'm invincible there are a lot of things that we can do to try and help the process of law\nAnd the older people get the more likely they are to make these changes since sometimes it's suggested by a doctor and\nSometimes you make those changes because a friend of yours had suggested by the doctor\nAnd so um we we do find the older people get more proactive they tend to be but still it's not ... in the survey we didn't have even close to a hundred percent saying I'm attempting to do healthy lifestyle choices most of the time\nI think it was kind of interesting though is we've been looking at this survey\nUm the different generations the millennials the genetic church the boomers shares similar dreams they share similar visions about what retirement future retirement is is going to look like\nThey're planning a and they're planning on living long lives and it may turn out to be even longer than that because there are advances in medicine so maybe that will you know maybe in Twenty years people will look back and say remember when people used to think that eighty was old\nThat would be interesting ... yes\nWouldn't that changed the retirement landscape well guess what it's already changed my grandmother who lived to be a hundred in in over a hundred that was an anomaly or people who were born when she was born rarely made it past sixty five quite frankly\nYes that is true in fact that's why Medicare started when it did and and my Social Security started when he did ... years ago there was some TV show that used to celebrate couples who had a sixtieth anniversary\nThat doesn't happen anymore because there are so many of them yeah so that right there tells you about how much longer people are living\nIn a ... I forget the guy's name the weatherman are used to celebrate people's one hundredth birthday\nOh yes and um I don't remember his name either ... right yeah it was a time we celebrated down in one hundreds but that's why they should let me think about her and she was famous but he also when he reached a hundred you didn't have near as many people and that he was setting the trend it's so which of\nCourse you're wearing what this means though is that if you are looking at a long life if you are looking at a long retirement\nYou don't want to just enter this process haphazardly you want to have a plan in place and let's make sure that fewer of our listeners have that plan in place or can we offer them a couple of um retirement plans\nRight on the retirement plans and see where you are how many steps have you made so far how many steps either left for you to do are you where you think you should be ah we've got a lot of people who\nYou know who sometimes say well I've I've got it in my head in fact in this survey they talk about people who have their plan up in their head and maybe they had a few notes that they wrote down there that we're talking about something that's going to be more concrete than that and that you can use your foundation and then work on it and and build on it\nSo uh can give away a couple of a retirement plan trend yeah let's do that that would it be great and um you know starting now follows here so let you know let's get a move on at the\nTime to do it for a zero six three to eight seven seven over next to callers for eight zero six three to eight seven seven zero call right now next to callers and get a customized is not a cookie cutter little thing\nUh this is customized for you for your goals for your retirement for where you are now where you want to be in the future this is your roadmap for your retirement and it may very well be a long\nAnd hopefully it's going to be a successful retirement so next to callers for zero six three\nTo eight seven seven though and for those of you listening on podcast or you can also get in on this by texting the word road map all one word text road map to three three two two two that's road map\nTo the number three three to do to for your road map to retirement you are free plant will continue the conversation and just\nTo gun jak Nancy call for a do six to seven seven do that for a six three to age\n... smart retirement continues after these messages\nFrom sorry you're going to be a block\nYou want to learn how to make money flipping houses right here in Phoenix if so we have an amazing opportunity for you weren't looking for a small group of motivated individuals to join our real estate investing team you are in our simple three step system for flipping homes right here in the local area business than\nMeryl store of eighties hit TV show foot this house my team and I are looking for a handful of people in the Phoenix area who want to learn how to make money flipping houses in your spare time using other people's money\nPhoenix is a free market for my system and next week I'm holding a free to our educational workshop where you will learn how to make money flipping homes\nAnd how to build long term wealth with income properties\nTo to to free tickets to fans workshop touched your five digits ZIP Code in two thousand seeding is extremely limited so texture five digits ZIP Code to eighty two thousand text in the next ten minutes and you'll also reserve of free ...

financial services to human looking at his retirement and a survey on retirement and really at\nThe financial well being of many people really a lot of people were damaged by the great recession I think there was a lot of psychological damage\nThere was a lot of psychological damage the idea is I work so hard to put this away\nAnd now it's gone and so the old saying you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps kicked in\nAnd so just as one example because obviously there were so many people impacted I met them over the years it just recently there was a couple who came in and in their situation they had started a business and so when this\nHappened they lost their business and so they were disappointed because it was it just the loss of business that they had taken a moneys that they said when they were working and put into their business so there was that loss there was also the cost of\nNot having earning during that time and the cost of not only did they spend some of what they set aside quite a bit of it even but they also weren't earning so they were back pedaling during about eight years that time there were backpedaling seriously they were\nAnd so I'm One save set that aside and went ahead and you went back into the of you know the job or he had his skill set and she is working part time and they went ahead and just started building and building and so when they came in and their thought was\nOkay let's see how bad it is kind of a feeling because my mom you know all they could focus on was their loss and then they were just pushing forward as hard as they could to\n... you know work and live on what they were earning but also to be able to set aside\nYou know once you took a hit like that you feel like you're never going to get out from behind the eight\nBall yeah and that was their feeling in fact when I came in they said well you know we know we're not in good shape we know that we're probably you know we just we know that we're probably have a lot of work to do but they actually had done a really good job without realizing it\nAh being able to pull themselves up and so we when we went ahead and put things together as they were pleasantly surprised and were able to say oh\nGosh I didn't think we had a shot at retirement intel well pass Seventy so it was a it was just really really nice to be able to sit with them and work on some of these things and\nAnd to help them to see that hey you're better off than you thought you might because of this paradigm in their mind you know you always see things up and they were still kind of looking back saying gosh this is what we lost it they did in the years we lost and that is that money that we lost and is it the money that we\nDidn't say you know they were focused so much on that to be able to shift that paradigm from okay this is what happened then but this is what you've been doing since and be able to\nGet um a realistic uh\nOutlook on where they were way it was really good I think and they you know they were really happy that their efforts hadn't been\nHad been make you know paying off really their efforts have been paying off\nConfidence has recovered from the lows of the financial crisis but then confidence kind of stalled out for a while at least according to the survey people we're making progress them exotic well yeah but I'm not really getting ahead I'm not doing enough [noise]\nRight and again this ... I I don't know where this comes from because we've got you're pointing out some you know really good economic numbers so it might just be people in their own life like this couple I was talking about they may just not no\nYou know it's like I don't know where I Am I see you know my utilities have gone up or have there isn't some unexpected expenses so I really don't know where I stand and I think this is where with you know again where we take our road map and how people plug in where they are so that\n... if you are right to be not very confident at least you will know that if you are just thinking that because you don't think you're doing all that you ought to be doing or that you know you should be doing a hate the word should because\nHe didn't have that word down makes you you know it's just a negative word because we all should be doing better right it's almost an editor loves it and when you use the word should is is what I Am doing and this is what I you know I I couldn't do this or this is the best I can and this is why and\nWhat would I again proactively need to change or do in order to do what I think I could do yes and so those are some banks people can fill in for themselves\nAnd Tony this though is that we don't really know what we need to know for example I did a lot of people are trying to save up there they're putting money away they're they're building up that nest egg if you will\nBut they're not confident that the nest egg is going to be sufficient to see them through retirement is back to the thing that we've talked about so many times one of the biggest fears is that people are afraid they will outlive their money and it's understandable if what you're doing is building up a nest egg\nBecause you're not going to be living off of a nest egg in retirement you got to have income in retirement\nI don't think we've lived before but I Do know is you can't be\nOkay with that I only have one life to live and I need protection against ... know how

retirement for years but I've heard this a\nAnalogy of retirement as a three legged stool you know\nOh absolutely that you need at least three legs on your store for it to be sturdy otherwise you're going to ... ... right and so I think you know think about what three things you need in order to have a secure retirement\nWe have Social Security we have employer sponsored pensions and we had personal savings account which would be including your retirement accounts some people throw in having a house that's paid for so you're secure that way\nBut that three legged school it still is wildly because of the intentions I mean I regularly see people who their pensions are frozen or they're saying hey we're going to go ahead and just pay you at your pension and we're not going to provided any long and retirement we'll give you a lump sum and you get to figure out what to do with it\nThat's one of the reasons I I think too that people work longer and retirement without a pension\nYour your pension is giving you the regular income that your job is to provide albeit it will probably be less but still regular income and so you keep working in order to keep that\nThird leg of the stool intact\nAnd tell you can figure out a way to be sure that your income is going to replace the income that you're giving up when you voluntarily go into unemployment also known as retirement [laughter]\nIn fact the survey says thirty nine percent are now looking at working as a source of income in retirement so yeah the ... what they used to be understood you try and love all around the stool by by working a little longer a little longer\nWell and we've been told ... mentioned this several your number of times when we had a um guy re who works in the government in this type of a department who was saying that you're ... ended up replacing pensions that wasn't the original objective the pen for one case where\nOr I or race or ... posted in supplement the pension but ended up taking them over in large measure due to the longer life expectancy is um and so how and he was saying you need to go ahead and create income with some of this four one K. because it's the pension replacement\nYou're not getting your pension anymore so you need to figure out a way to create\nA way that you'll have regular income that you can't outlive and he was mentioning income annuities as one possibility which would be because that's what Social Security is and that's what I'm a pension is and so you would need to then use an annuity herself because uh that's kind of a definition of your pensions\nRaises century or pension is is a form of an annuity and we almost have something like that in Social Security as well\nBut what we're looking for is income to last us through out or retirement however long that retirement might be a lot of folks of finally started to realize that for one case for three bees are raised different savings or investment accounts or not this\nSame as having guaranteed income to last us throughout retirement no matter how long that retirement will be there is a big difference between the savings vehicles um\nWhich we could refer to as defined contribution and a pension which would be a defined benefit\nAnd now we've got to figure out not just not just if we'd gone through this process of having to figure out how to save and invest in the four oh one K. Shariah race now we've got to figure out how to ...\nAbsolutely and it's interesting because you don't you're trying to replicate what you did when you were working when you were working you were accumulating so it was okay and you put money in because your income with steady\nWhen you retire then you've got to read replicate that again well you've got your savings but then you still have to replicate the income and so you're turning that coin upside down you're doing a hundred and eighty degree lab\nSo that you didn't have the same results as having savings and working they still now you need to have your savings and you still need to provide the income\nThat comes from working and that's really what are you know the roadmap is about that but that's the heart of our retirement planning is about them\nAnd that ... forms your base in conforms to base from which all the other parts come off of that particular piece that's why we often refer to it as a retirement puzzle we put these pieces in place so that you'll know where you're headed to create your retirement landscape\nBut really you're you're right I think and I think most people would agree that retirement income is the foundation debase of over term planning it is the base that provides the confidence to do the other things that you want to do in return\nIt does and once we had that in most people figure that out there's a greater level of security once they have you know what's going to work for them to hear it out\nA lot of people are not real confident about their Social Security in retirement folks tend to have worries about what are your thoughts on that well\nI I Know that the baby boomers are probably okay I Do know that if you look on your Social Security statement it says that by twenty thirty three twenty thirty for it that year will there year by year that that\nThe taxes being collected would fund about Seventy seven percent of the current benefits and so\nWe looked at factor that in and we do talk about that in our retirement nevertheless most baby boomers feel like there will be some income from Social Security I find younger people don't want to count on it and so they'll plan out their retirement and say if something is there that fantastic\nNobody's going to get upset about extra money coming in but you don't want to count on something that's not there and it would be difficult not to have Social Security and in some form um and I you know but I Do you know all I can say hey I'm reading this and they're saying there's not enough taxes being collected for current benefits\nYou know a lot of people look at retirement say oh it's I just had this much saved up I Would be okay they have a number in their head and five hundred thousand a million in and actually if five hundred thousand is the median of what most people think they need\nThe younger people think more like a like a younger person will think a million but yes if you're looking at the average again according to this survey number a lot of people think I'll be okay if I have five hundred thousand dollars states said that is what is in this trans America center survey\nFunny thing is that most people are they're just kind of guessing it this estimate\nThey do gas they do gases and um and the guessing is I don't know I don't want to base my life on a gas you know what I'm saying I just I guess that roads open I knew it used to be under construction back you know I guess it's open I just had that I say that's added house on the other day where I\nUsing my cell phone and it told me to turn and I turned oh and guess what those that road which still all blocked off and I had to go the way that I knew not you know the way that I knew that that experience they've done it before\nBut it's kind of interesting there's this really funny story that I heard again the other day I had heard it years ago but I had forgotten about it and there is down\nThere were three people in the private chartered airplane we had a a minister and we have the president have a computer company and\nWe have a boy scout and did that power comes back and says I have really bad news there is something wrong with the plane and we're going to crash and we only have three parachutes I Am taking one of these parachutes because I have four little children at home without any ground the parachute and he jumped out of the plane\nWhile the quick thinking president of the computer company said that while I Am not about the smartest person in the world I Am needed by my company and I am going to take his their shirt and he took it and he jumped out of the plane\nSo the minister looked at the boy scout and he said young man he said I Am older I have lived a long time I had a good life

stay healthy but quite frankly it could be drawn to you know with all the different supplements out there not Chris you've traveled all over the world\nLearning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this besides the good multi vitamin it's a visual maybe a few other things go into the street super high nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nWell at the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called resume or a troll and apropos what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively investigated they use in their host countries though I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith two ... I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with raspberry trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and Chile and South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that green tea\n... came in from to recruit cameras ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from a very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human different spiritual why do you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other work better you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells\nIn our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial in one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nLet's dive into the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing I Know what I usually been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging\nBut what are you seeing recently in the press I Know you told me the nutrition research journal and is July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti accident activity and have blood to sign on to recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay well you just said about increasing class my antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume don't actually wind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood and concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nGet this great concentration of antioxidants substances which are protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to\nExposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are that right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue the thigh on so you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to file and so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do\nBut it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula\nWould be offering so we bought him a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human what'd you smelled C.
