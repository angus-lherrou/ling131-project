all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nAnd how your kill max formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you can follow us there was a low levels of magnesium your heart beat who very important factor in life\nI Would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety\nAsthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes\nFibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's that's due process and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd then this this was associated with a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with no what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about\nThere's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said he drank so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes your body needs to actually feel the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain okay I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back\nPain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's they're linked there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happened is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiencies and then the gleaming museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more arrests or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting on life you start getting muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and you're about it actually started to manifest it\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this into the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's in a powder form you take hot water and you make if they put it in a cup tickets to sort of this powder and mix it in you know and you drink is cut down the street ... is really

chiropractor he's been ... by top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns so Dr biggest what is this how secretly you've been talking about\nWell what the secret is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C.\nVitamin C. All right well I'm might have been sees is not really new though\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell and unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends and the bottom line is with out enough find them in the end the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system compromise\nYou're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies diabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be shortened by six years\nBut but don't do most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contains about sixty five milligrams\nOf vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three to four thousand a year and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice so because of lack of vitamin C. they weren't getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well\nThe number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just don't eat energy I don't feel like myself\nI'm hurting yeah and then the doctors give the wheels spinning in their head and they go all we've got to do these tasks send you through the scanner and the problem is is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd it was interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. alright the other ones are any pigs primates and the fruit bat\nWhen you look at the rest of the animals out there you don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure you don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. huh and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day\nSome animals like a goat Yeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it\nYou know right but you know I think most people and myself included thinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is that\nYou know what it is actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amount and the right kind\nAnd that's why I created my supersede twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down to have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... your body needs different forms of it and I put it all into one vitamin formula\nNow and you said there was how much vitamin C. and your supersede twenty to forty years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what what are some of the the things that you'll experience\nWell the first thing you're gonna experiences energy vitamin C. produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is okay if I read an email to sure sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay I'll listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped\nIt he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days he said now another thing that happened is I became more alert and I now have a clear head off from vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nI Want to let your listeners know that if you want to get a free book about vitamin C. N. try Dr ... says supersede twenty two formula absolutely risk free there's a special toll free number to call it's one\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I did go to the supermarket before I got here [laughter]\nOkay and I brought some vitamin C. and I I went and bought these and I'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this\nThis particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in it so it right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well just one type of score but gas it right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... now cellulose as ground up newspaper\nOr the next one is uh vegetables Sterritt gases now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form\nA and the next one is a silica silica sand sand like the beach\nAll right so here's another one try this one here okay so this is a national brand here right right so it's just five hundred milligrams okay this is a tool yes All right so take a look at the ingredients okay I'm ... sucrose sugar okay ... sure\nSodium a score right that's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium but vegetables ... said that that lubricant again and effort DNC yellow number six there you go number six so now that's usually collared vitamin C.\nNow what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different from these that we are talking about\nWell what's different about is

method of being able to drink it down as water soluble goes right to work in your body\nAnd it has the proper amount of vitamin C. per survey there's Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving ... there's

saying well I'll give you I'll give it a couple of headlines\nThis study was conducted at the University of California\nAnd it found that people who to the vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease or reduced over forty percent ... study reported in the international journal vitamin a nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes out ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C. and their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Mila leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system or energy that's just from vitamin C.\nWow now earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work\nWell this is the kind of groundbreaking research on vitamin C. and weight loss but what

C. E. J. was the key coordinator in leader Capitol Hill for all the issues relating to Islamic terrorism in ideology he served as foreign policy counsel to us congresswoman suit Merrick and it was also stamp directed the congressional anti terrorism caucus\nFollowing its time and the hill EJ served as much sought after consultant and gum relations by Congress people and corporations like\nEgypt most recently served as director of us operations for the Israel analyzed foundation which has become for many the go to resource in Capitol Hill for pro Israel and Middle East policy\nDecisions also national security consultant providing training for law enforcement professionals national security organizations business\nGroups on the nature of the extremist threat and engagement techniques DJ's a pleasure to have you with us today\nBanks may or it's going to be with you\nThank you so let's begin with is CJ tell us a little about the Israel victory project to that you direct explained please the scope of the work it's stated goals and how you go about pursuing those objectives\nShirt so let me take a few minutes to sort of walk through this um\nYou know the Israel victory project was an idea that started in Nineteen Ninety nine a by Daniel Pipes a president and founder of the middle east forum when speaking in the living room in Detroit Michigan\nOr talking about the state of the peace process and sort of having that moment of an epiphany\nRealizing that not only was it not working with the Oslo process failing but that it couldn't work\nAnd they couldn't work for one very simple reason the Palestinian side was still fighting a war\nThat there was a a belief or when the Oslo Accords were a\nSort of started and and what not famous handshake took place on the White House lawn that you know piece of insight you know the Israelis Palestinians coming together\nYou know the the Soviet Union had fallen there is a global coalition to each jak Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait and now there's talk about Israelis and Palestinians living in peace you know it was for it I think is just one person wrote and commentary about that time period um\nYou know oh overtook reality ... and this was reality injecting itself back into a Daniels realization of of this fact\nSo the Israel victory project you know as as we move forward and as you know successive presidents have continued to pursue this\nPeace process and I would put that in quotes if we were in person [noise] um this peace process movement is has no chance to succeed because historically speaking wars going and buying negotiations they end when one side gives up\nHe realizes that it cannot achieve at school\nSo you know if you just look quite frankly looking at the north the north Korea Today you know the Korean War is still going on one of the demands of North Korea is that the U.S signed a treaty to end the war\nYou know that's still an active war going on why because neither side gave up at school that is true and you know World War one versus World War two Germany you can see a big difference there and World War two Germany gave up they ... they could not win\nThey accepted that defeat and once they accepted the terms were negotiated by which the sides were willing to live and the Japanese did the same thing at the end of World War two so there is historical precedent for this hypothesis and\nYou know if you look at the other way it really there's there's no basis to it and just one more example a recent example if you look at Columbia\nKnow a lot of times people don't focus on on our own atmosphere but if you look at Columbia and the battle that they fought for years against the FARC which recently ended with a negotiated settlement except that's not how it ended it ended when the Colombian people finally had to have enough\nTold their government\nAnd this threat to the military was driving the FARC into the jungles to the point where the FARC realize that they could not win anymore and they were willing to give up their goal to land when they did when they did they feel they got was an incredible\nThey actually got a very good deal to which the people in Colombia where upset that they got so much which is a lesson for the Palestinian side that you're complaining about what you don't have right now but\nIf you can just accept the reality that Israel existed to own land of the Jewish people in the Jewish state the future have a lot of bright possibilities for you not so long yeah\nI'm Sorry you in the in Denver to do to address the false narrative\nWhich hospital we celebrated [laughter] more into Oslo twenty five years ago September thirteenth\nIndian Deborah to address the false new to the underscores the search for peace\nUh uh and it's one that suggests that the conflict between these when the Arabs want of territory which of course to actually medically legitimize the bogus concept to but land for peace is a Bible wouldn't necessarily piece strategy\nWe at least here in the middle east waiting for them argue against regularly or the endeavor to expose this madness ... it's one of the territory your comment\nBut I I agree with you this is not about territory in fact\nYou know there's less conception that you know the Palestinians just walked around the state they just want the the dignity to have their own state when if you just looked at the reality over the last twenty five years they been offered a state repeatedly and they don't want to stay there interest is not in gaining statehood for themselves\nIt's about destroying statehood for the gym he well said bats their goal so you know the idea that it's about land decision this is about a mindset which we turn rejection as it is the rejection as some of the Jewish people's rights to live in this land\nThat's what they reject and what the Israel victory project\nProposes is that until the Palestinians and their rejection as one of the Jewish state of Israel no negotiation should take place because they cannot possibly succeed whichever one month can accept that thing you can negotiate terms or not before\nAnd we would certainly agree with you and I'm looking at the clock Lee coming up to break share to Israel itself I mean the the very the very voice of the Israeli government is one which has misled us in believing that this is a peace part when in fact you isn't\nRight so so let me give you quickly before this break sort of what we what we've done so I've been running the operations in the United states focused on in Washington DC\nOr in January of last year we launched the Israel victory project that we help stand up the Israel victory caucus in the U.S Congress for thirty four numbers bipartisan groups supporting this idea that the Palestinians the owners should be on them for their rejection ism\nBut to your point [noise] it's not a not for the United states to say this is what we think should happen Israelis need to\nShow in Israel we help stand up the Connecticut Israel victory caucus with membership from\nSeven political parties twenty six cannot said members the prime minister's party that defense minister's party\nThey shut the our co chairs of the uh cock his um and that's the point of that clock as it's to bring in this consensus that agrees yeah there's different\nSolutions being propose of what you know the final status should look like but they agreed that it doesn't matter right now because\nEveryone can throw out their ideas but until the Palestinian side and their war\nWhat's the next step so Israel goes and they root them out they destroyed the terror network infrastructure underneath Gaza and Israel they do all of that however many months two years that it takes to get it done and then what\nWhat do you do with Gaza Israel doesn't want it Egypt doesn't want it the international community is not going to touch it the Palestinian authority wants it but they can't possibly control it so after you've gone through and sacrifice to do it the result is turning it back over to the same people\nSo you know this is where it gets into this this\nBalance a sort of thing in the world of the international diplomacy of you know what I found is good and what is feasible and what works in the best interests of\nOf the people in Israel right now what you're seeing the defense minister\nCaught off guard Lieberman who's a proponent of this IBP Israel victory project policies oh good for an asset member from his party with the founding chairman mhm topic artist and he called for cutting off the fuel that just started going into Gaza\nYou know the cops are out of the Qataris are providing fuel so that a ...\nIn Gaza bacon have electricity instead of four hours a day up to eight hours a day and the security establishment and Israel was very supportive of this because they believe that that will help a lower the tensions\nWith Gaza but Lieberman after this week and a um violence said no more no more it's going in there\nUntil the violin stops so you have this battle if you will between some of the political leadership and the security establishment over sort of short term interest and long term interests have you on term interest in maintaining calm at all cost\nMoney in the long term how does that help Israel's long term security\nOkay I'm looking at the clock we have a break coming up in about a minute I think one of the things that we can't lose sight of is the fact that uh any viable peace treaty with the Arabs which is forest nonsensical priest opposes the going to be some ... between the ear camp\nA in God's on that in the ... on the west bank a confederation of sorts\nOr they are at odds with each other or if they can get together and we understand why they can't build cars and belligerent people driven by bellicose and belligerent ideology than certainly these released can't believe\nThe best thing this can hope for is the absence of war it's peace through strength but that's something we'll get back to when we come back from the break a guest today is EJ Kimball directed the Israel victory project at Middle East for him he's a national security expert no sooner thirty on\nCounter terrorism as we do each week remind you to please use the sponsors of this show and tell them that you heard about them in the show it's because of them

that the with Trump in the White House there's a new sheriff in town\nOr we've seen the very obvious changes most which suddenly you save Israel and the U.S embassy Taylor forced to act\nDefunding the Palestinians defending unreal are all based on the Palestinian refusal to suspend its genocidal attitude towards the Jewish state in yet both from Israel and the United states this is talk of this impending peace plan\nThe Trump revolution no certainly not going to change fourteen hundred years of Muslim hostility to all things not Islamic new Disney changed seven decades of Arab intention to radically did you state\nTo the question I think I have for EJ is the Arabs and play the waiting game the perspective of history is certainly different than that of the west and I know that you are an expert and Islamic affairs the Muslim world which still refuses to recognize the ability to be Jewish state is willing to wait\nUntil two thousand Twenty one or worst case for them to thousand twenty five when perhaps less sympathetic empathetic president I'm might be sitting in the White House instead of Trump where after Trump shouldn't Israel my question to you EJ shouldn't Israel therefore push hard now\nA for his many policy changes as possible while the U.S State Department is led by the historically hostile foreign service people that had been for seven decades\nWell that that's been the point that we've been making and you know here's a great example is is with on your ah with the un relief works agency for Palestine refugees and and there's many things to point out about the problems but under a amongst them is the a perpetuation of this\nVictim hood mentality that they impose it on the people by you know providing this refugee status to third fourth fifth generation children born today from a war\nThat ended Seventy years ago and in you know a helping promote this this belief that one day they will return to the homes of their you know grandparents and great grandparents\nOr in Israel and you know what a President Trump has done and you know we've been leading the effort on the middle east forum is to say you know what we're ...\n... ... is a problem it does not help the situation that needs to change now the president has cut off funding to unwrap\nIt helps with students on campus to to give them the the knowledge so that they can go out there and start pushing and and advocating part\nUm it's it takes investment and it's going to take a you know being willing to stand up for what you believe in you know that's that's part of what makes this country so great is the ability that we can\nWe can speak freely in this country now and some college campuses\nUh doesn't always look that way but you know we have to be willing to stand up and let our voices be heard and and push forward with what's what's right and you know protected under the constitution and not let those that want to suppress speech when you know went out\nI'll tell you what troubles me American Jews in the tourist liberal in their political proclivities or in most presidential elections of course history shows that they voted least Seventy five percent democratic\nNotwithstanding the discernible break from the previous support the Democratic party had for Israel a generation ago in the two thousand uh Thirteen to ... which is quite comprehensive\nAnti in civil service that they had done since including January this year the\nAverage American Jewish voter demonstrated very little interest in Israel suggesting that the choice of candidates that they choose\nA very ... invariably are based on other issues and not the Israeli shoe Israel was always fifth six or seven on the list of things which are important in choosing candidates would that type of support from the American Jewish community\nMaybe we shouldn't be surprised that the Israelis and getting the support that it needs\nAn infant here\nWell you know I've I've had these discussions a lot over the last dozen years or so especially living here in Washington DC which is you know why do choose overwhelmingly support democratic presidents I mean you know our previous president was not a Israel's best friend by any means you being ... [laughter]\nI'm In Washington the thing that will diplomatic speak um [laughter]\nBut you know the\nEnd up talk I said you know what about the Iran deal and you know the the view from some people is that book\nThey believe that Israel is the strongest country in the neighborhood and if they truly feel threatened in from the Iranians Israel will take out their nuclear weapons capability now whether or not that's possible whether or not Israel with the U.S to do it\nOf those questions aside the perception is that Israel is that powerful that if it's truly that threat to Israel they will take care of the problem and therefore that does not need to be number one on there\nA issue with it can be social issues can be their top concerns it can be healthcare it can be gay rights that can be you know Second Amendment issues you know that's that's the answer that I tend to get from people as to why Israel is not their number one voting issue\nYou know tell them it's the same way the grandparents to lose two generations ago did they simply didn't know was happening in Europe it's it's it's bogus dumps already go ahead\nWell you know I'm I'm a rare voter who uh who votes foreign policy is as my\nI'm a you know main\nMain issue area when I'm choosing my candidate but you know most people they you know the focus is how does this impact my bottom line I Am you know ... and ... Israelis and Clinton we think that Israel will ultimately be fine and I'm more worried about how this impacts things here\nWearing his right to sixty seven year old liberal Jewish ladies more concerned about abortion something she plans and having won the ... but his real estate but nonetheless we have been on the line with the phone call Dan\nHello yes please\nThank you for taking my call a microchip to your guest is a human is something above the Palestinians do have that dream that someday they will march into Israeli land and take a whole is back it's a dream\nWell if we compare that to that dream of the Jewish people that some day they will come back to their homeland it took ... years\nAs they do achieve their dreams so why not okay for the Palestinians to have that a lot of Palestine and by the way okay I'm a Christian and I'm not a state\nAnd there are crucial details things but nonetheless go ahead\nChris I'm Iraqi Christians okay not a Palestinian and I'm not an Arab either and I have respect for those people they just people and the Palestinian people\nLead to your question please because then you must you cook book and my question is if she would say the Palestinians still have that do that someday they will fill fill it they'll come back to their homeland and blah blah blah and showed that the Jews and it took ... to ... years for that will lead to a homeland\nI Will let our guests to answer that but the dream that they have isn't to establish a state as you might have heard it too and the state the president leagues is there that is what we are concerned about uh you Jake please\nSure um and and thinks that thanks for the question 'cause it it raises a good point which is ... ... you're correct having the Palestinians having the dream of doing this is not something that can be destroyed it's the ability to act upon that dream\nAnd when I was referencing with ... but the fact that ... is giving oxygen to that dream they're they're telling the Palestinians you know what this dream that you have it can become a reality if you just keep doing what you're doing and what me Israel victory project\nIs proposing is the exact opposite which is to tell the Palestinians\nIf this is what your dreams are your lives will not get better in fact they will get worse because the international community will not continue to support this sort of behavior\nTreating them like adults treating them as being responsible for their actions so having the dreams that's fine you know in the Islamic world you know Muslims ah you know al ... or ISIS dream of free conquering alarmed loose in Spain you know but\nThey don't have the capability can do that right now that they still have that dream\nBut they can't act upon it and that's why Spain is not being invaded right now that to be taken over show when looking at the situation here\nThe dream is fine for them to maintain I Would prefer it they didn't have that dream but that's not the point the international community should not be giving credence to such a a just such a a dream that they think that that's the best way forward for the world\nOkay I'm coming against which is going to lead into question uh as far as Israel's security concern the notion I Believe of moderate Islam is dangerous in of itself because it priests opposes it\nThere are various forms of Islam if I went into my local Barnes and nobles or if I went on Google Amazon and wanted to buy your book the Koran I Can't ask for the modern version of the Koran\nOr if it's the same on the crew on that I Would be reading is the same one that I totally Khomeini Louis Farrakhan Keith Ellison read will have in the libraries and there is no mater which slump now there are moderate Muslims\nBut that is not a form of moderate Islam you thoughts\nAbout hey I think when you're looking at Islam and the crime the Koran is something that is not being changed for you know well\nDepending on when it was finally written down and and the version but you're looking at you know about for Thirteen fourteen hundred years\nSo it is what it is you know the the understanding in Islam you know the the moderate as as you mentioned moderate Muslims versus moderate Islam or Muslim or even said there is Islam\nThere is an ... different versions of not like in Judaism where there's a orthodox conservative better than form and there's been this movement to differentiate between them there is no such thing in a swamp now there are certainly people who are trying to promote\nA I'm a more pacifist version\nOf Islam but I'm studying jock yeah go\nAhead it is sort of like the the two raw\nHe's immutable the difference between unorthodox you to conservative Jew in the reform Jew isn't in the what the Bible says rather than the level of observation for your you know it's it's how one observes there or you know people who observed the different levels\nDetritus immutable eat is what it is there aren't two versions of it as they are not two versions of the ground that's the point that I'm trying to make\nRight well and and so you know this goes back to the previous question really which is bad or understanding and Islam and the the idea of a you know re conquering land that was once conquered by Islam does given by a lot to the Muslims and there are eternal obligation to re conquer it you know bad at something in the doctrine\nNow those that don't adhere to the doctor and strictly that's those are people that\nAre more of our potential allies for us but those people that do strictly adhere to it now there is no way for Hamas to turn around today and say we accept the right of the Jewish state to exist in in this slammed because\nHamas by its own a constitution would cease to exist he would go against everything that it stands for so and that's that's a challenge that actually Hamas is facing internally which is because they're in a position of leadership in Gaza and because Israel\nFor their own reasons want to keep Hamas in charge at the moment there's this idea that from us as a sexually accepting Israel's right to exist and it's causing this internal battle going on with any ... between the Palestinian Islamic jihad between Hamas and others over the next idea\nIt is possible to participate in the upside of the market and be one hundred percent\nProtected from market declines we call

that point it doesn't matter if the market goes down twenty percent or even fifty percent\nYour account will stay at a minimum of just over a hundred and fourteen thousand until it grows again\nLet's imagine that the market dropped by twenty percent the following year how much would your account be worth\nThat's right still just over a hundred and fourteen thousand if you can convert some of your current retirement savings into something that would never lose value in the marketplace and still realize market gains with no market losses would that be of interest to you\nGive me a call ... maybe

working with clients right here in the valley of the sun you know what the definition of insanity as according to Albert Einstein it's doing the same thing\nOver and over again expecting different results from the moment you started investing you're probably fresh out of high school or college I'm sure it became very apparent to you that the market goes up and the market goes down\nYou've seen it over and over again that every few years the market crashes and sometimes it crashes hard\nFor most of your life you didn't really care in fact if you're like me I wanted the market to crash back in my younger years why because it was a buying opportunity besides I knew the market would recover and I was young enough that I wasn't going to be using the money anytime soon anyway\nThings are different now closer I get to retirement the last cavalier I get towards my retirement money the more I realized that I have very little or no time to recover from a major market correction\nMark Twain once said I'm not so interested in return on my money as the return of my money this ... this is true today is it was when he said it corruption uncertainty and the ups and downs of the market they haven't gone away are you interested more in the return of your money\nWhat if we could do more than that\nGive us a call at eight four four three seven one safe that's eight four four three

sound different than what you're being told by the other financial shows or the other brokers out there I Know it is because we keep you from doing something insane with your retirement\nRemember the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the truth is that nothing's changed your portfolio was at risk when you were twenty five years old just
