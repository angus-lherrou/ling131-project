that is correct we should put that picture up actually I spoke to penguins in the Antarctic um the two subjects happiness and\nEthical monotheism and they ah they were equally interested in both there was one paying when the hundred or so looking at me the other is most of the others had their nose under the butt of their partner\nOh this is\nWhy does that make me strange 'cause it's a beat [noise]\nThey don't have noses okay they beaks paying would send patients have beaks and I guess you're a member\nThere birds there at Quantico birds I guess why every body and this is the happiness our today's subject\nI admit at the outset so here is a trigger a warning we need you know what we need a musical or some sound effect [noise]\nIt's not a dog whistle it's a trigger an Elvis is not a dog whistle this is a trigger for the sensitive\nSo that they will know that they may be challenged or even a God Forbid really God Forbid offended\nBy that works\nSo here it is every body\nAnd\nThe what made me think of this topic was actually the last hour the previous hour talking about nationalism so I have a theory and you've probably heard\nMe say two thousand or so\nTimes 'cause I have a lot of theories about life but I have a theory that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are\nAnd they are in no uh in order of importance just three identities that I think are they are necessary or they are major additives to\nOne's happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a loan doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they are great contribute towards towards happiness or sexual identity male or female a national identity and the religious identity\nI think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those and I won't even identify them 'cause it's a happiness our want everybody to listen and everybody to be as comfortable as possible\nBut there are those who are working to\nIdentify those identities and say that they they really are not real and they are not even good\nBut that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population by knocking these identities\nOne aide Prager seven seven six so that I Believe that the more comfortable you are with being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl\nAnd that is that is a serious part of your identity sir I Will be totally or buy a graphic here I have always been I'm very lucky I admitted more comfortable with being mail\nI've never wanted to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and die I celebrate ... to ... to whatever extent that celebrate a boy I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nAre the most ardent defender of the transgendered and I'm not even attacking the trench is on the contrary he was not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nOr then your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness if it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it's something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try still to maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you've got to really did my reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness\nWe're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female so that's one identity\nI identities in fact almost been given a bad Maine oh he has an identity ooh that's not that's not good next to the national identity I think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAnd ... and I think I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness and I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I'm a man\nOr or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more I identify as this is Mike ... pieces of this happiness our the more you identify with\nThe the greater chance for happiness in third as your religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is for Christians obviously there are the majority great majority of that you are listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're a Mormon if you're if you're Catholic if your Protestant if you're evangelical or whatever it might be\nWhat every ... it could it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee in life you\nCan be a you can be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show breaking\nI was the moderator and there's a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then they were members of fourth religions\nAnd I\nWould get calls people would call him and I remember how many people called and it was amazing to me that is so much so that one time there were so many people who identify themselves as hey Hi Dennis so I just want to say to the pre so I'm an ex Catholic\nOr I'm a recovering Catholic and I I I I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves like nobody called the say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter]\nAnd I try to I think it ... you know try to kick shut up and bike and also with my

hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality\nOr what what she says is true Susan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely human being\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't it interesting I mean of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she says she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that a ad in Chicago hello ed Dennis Prager\n... thank you for taking my

Will be speaking at Colorado State university next week I Will need I Will need security no leftist me just security at a at a university that's a far larger issue than one crock pot here or one crock

started looking keel unreal they get on the line with my has been shown that million\nAre certainly honor that fact my I'd be curious than\nTo hear your response to my general take on divorce children maybe it's not the divorce that is most troubling but what happens after the divorce if parents do not sniping one another\nAnd maintain listen we are not married but we remain your father and your mother\nMy experience in life including out of my own children has been that that works but so many times like I was a long\nWays okay you know it goes a long long way chefs\nWell vats clinical you go on\nWell and and particularly when either one or both of the parents remarry and you're bringing in a one or two more years old that are writing as\nParental units I think it's extremely important and in my own divorce that was\nA not the case it was not a what we call a good divorce if there is such a thing and it did have some major impact upon our children are there is like there are mistakes that I made certainly\nThere were things I was not aware of but uh I think you're absolutely correct on that on that issue it doesn't alleviate everything but it does go a long long ways to help them deal with what is\nNothing but a I mean almost all the time a bad situation for the kids there are certainly exceptions yeah we don't bill are not in the lab easily hot\nListening yeah you're very thoughtful man and I appreciate it in a row I think we're substantial agreement look life is filled\nWith obstacles to happiness and filled with a land mines and that is how we navigate our life that ultimately determines or ability to handle that hopefully with some degree of happiness\nI\nHave a lot of a lot of lot of folks on divorce and I should I haven't talked about in quite some time I've talked about a much more in the past and I will address again thanks to this call\nBut he and I both agree that the issue is what you do after the divorce more than the divorce I mean many things are factors including what age you you divorce my child's child's age\nIt's very different if the child is too that if the trial was twelve or the child was twenty two\n\nThat's that's it and see there's no comparison in fact\n\nBut but the the most calamitous results I ever seen or when a parent the parent the parent ... the other parent ... the other most children are attached to both parents\nAnd even if you are right\nCertain you're right the legitimizing of the other parents in in all but the most the most egregious cases is a sin against\nAgainst the child against your family or how are you doing there yeah All right I won't I won't take a call because we're going to take a break in a moment\nI think that\nPeople just need to understand very few logs or smooths including kids from intact parents how many people are at the psychiatrists and psychologists as parents never divorced\nThat's not to say that all things being equal that's the ideal of course it's the ideal\nShall return in

I almost always related to larger questions of life\nSo it's reflected in the fact that many of your questions or personal issues or even religious issues because ... is there are significant to me but they're significant to you\nAs a preoccupation with only the political is is not a full life okay let's go to Steve in uh Los Angeles cello Steve Dennis Prager\nRight right but that that the point I Know you wanted to make and then just moving at all for speed or reasons is what boils his blood is not just being gratitude ... calling people on the right Nazis\nOr it's correct the there was no limits to the epithets that I'm Talking to stream is I mean they are extremist but I'm Talking about\n\nExceptions that stubborn and move it started with X not extremist exceptions exceptions the normative left wing view of could of conservatives especially those who support the president is that they're not to use it or not see like\nAnd that the president is is ushering in a Nazi like era New York review of books had an article by Holocaust historian from Yale or who are completely discredited himself and the New York review of books which is disgusting foolish\nAnd I think vile piece\nA comparing the road to the Holocaust or to uh to what is happening today in America ... this is a distinguished historian or at Yale utilizing the Holocaust to crap on the president they have no moral balance that's the point there are no parameters for these people\nFollowed the reason I have a ... for the left muscle liberals but for the left the left is a destructive force everywhere on earth is the forces of chaos they hate order the heat more order\nAnd they hate the people who represent that from police or two other conservatives okay and let's go to a totally different subject in Atlanta Georgia Dave hello Dave\nHow are you dinner well thank you\nYeah I Would tell you this I Am a Christian I was saying that you are my rabbi all of\nThem being able to honor to be your rabbi thank you sir\nYou know a couple of years ago you confirm that that'd be so you're saying well maybe it's more than the coins in her care and I would I Would argue\nThat ... near some of the bigger works aren't just might not be interesting to your audience member of the bigger worst ongoing thing but I'm going to smaller works to court and yeah they're ... they're called the ...\nAre you ... yeah I'm a freshman congressman uh what were you saying I Know where we went well I didn't get the word wop musician on the clock when there's a classical musician so I I'm a professional yeah oh yeah\nOkay I'll tell you the reason I suspected it Ninety nine percent of the people who call in or I speak to in life because I loved classical music as many of our listeners know who to love the Lucy or professional musicians\n... and then you have your ... are you guys appreciate what he does on an intellectual basis and then it touches you emotionally I totally get that\nBut I don't I don't play I conduct a but I'm a ... year old level but I I'm as a listener I have never been able to find the b._b._c. riveting\nPardon me I I yeah I feel bad because I hate depriving myself of pleasure it's one of the biggest sins of in my life is a pleasure out there and I haven't had it kills me\nDave I Would love to meet you and the police come over in Atlanta or send me even an MP three file something you think that'll really wouldn't be over the only reason I'm not devoting more is because I Know for most of the view but it doesn't matter even for most of you who don't even know they do see is it doesn't matter\n... the thing is I found like in college there were there were courses I took the subject but it didn't interest me but if the teacher was good that's ... that's what made it interesting all can do key uh Richard\nIn Chicago Hi Richard Dennis Prager\nGhana soil I agree with you at least five percent of what you say it's really you know what you know that's a lot of conservative follow it though but\nI think that uh you're right on the on the left for sure and and I'm Glad you didn't take my call after the onus on reference because I was laughing so hard it was\nIt was a fellow I Believe that I Do ...

I have an entire discussion of what that commandment is about in my irrational but which is changing laws which is what it's meant to do\nI feel so funny telling you that you should read it because I wrote it it sounds self serving so I don't know what am I supposed to do anyway it is it's mental change lives read the reviews on Amazon I don't have anything to do with those reviews\nAre okay let me try to see what I can do here\nJak in Cleveland if it's human nature to want communism to beat communism and slashed to be taken care of why should we oppose that well it's human nature to do a lot of things\nNine makes me mad\nOne culture and politics is Michael\nAnother very day in his greatest nation on God's green earth and it's always a great day when you can come into a weekend with great news to celebrate and it is great news for America is great news for\nRepublicans for Democrats for independence for people who don't care about politics at all\nThe perpetrator of that horrible bomb scare with fourteen different explosive devices mailed around the country\nAlleged perpetrator has been apprehended and he has been interrogated the proof is accumulating\nAnd the prospect as he will be going away for some forty years but meanwhile the president of the United states\nCharged as earlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to you for a few moments or with a friend and somebody who I I'm view as a very significant ally\nFor constitutional causes his name is Michael Ferris he has the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom and uh and and Mike we were just talking off the air for a moment\nOr I think we agree that one of the essential elements of trying to\nTo reduce the levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition when did you\nSee the historical American position has been I may disagree with everything you say it all depends on the right to say it\nAnd we're losing that left particular [noise] although there are some of the right to take this position but the left with the levers of power like jak Philips case where they tried to shut down or should they didn't want to\nUse his creative skills to speak a message in favor of same sex weddings and and the California case that we did a screen where last year were California force ... centers to give a pro abortion message [noise]\nPeople aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say them freely at you know\nCan we go to the California case for a moment because all of that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory which seems to mean for the alliance defending freedom\nI thought this was I I've spoken several times for fundraising banquets for um for crisis pregnancy centers and would crisis pregnancy centers tried to do is to give people an alternative\nIn a crisis pregnancy is where a very often people are in Mary they have no funds\nThat rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion or that the centers will help you ... the bear the child raising a child and and deal with all the challenges in ...\nAnd they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion services [laughter] go go to this address go here do there\nUm and that's about right isn't\n[noise] yes um I argued the case in the Supreme Court myself and you got it exactly right California's real to them in their papers passing a law this is a part of the progressive issues to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere I'm\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on abortion if if if you were on\nOur side of the issue of the other side of course I wasn't required to prove the Planned Parenthood has not affected by this law it was only they claim that they only wanted\nAll women to have all the news well didn't work that way\nRight and then comes just to get this so people see it so clearly in other words you would have been fine with is is that a Planned Parenthood day and said well if you want an alternative to abortion and then go to a crisis pregnancy center\nIn equal actually I Would have ... I Would take the position that Planned Parenthood shouldn't be forced to give our message and we shouldn't be forced to give the pro abortion message but the lack of quality shows what the real problem here is is that people want to silence\nViewpoint that they don't agree with and I think that that's that's where the lack of civility is really coming in and it's we're saying that the other people don't even have a valid point of view I mean we can there's a difference between saying\nI'm you know your time to express your view and saying I agree with your view and you know it's it's okay to disagree in this country but to some people are not allowed to disagree anymore and they will silence you if you disagree with the progressive viewpoint\nWhat uh what is the story going on right now in Blaine Adams and who is the ... does promotional T shirts a case\nCases pending in Kentucky Supreme Court [noise] um the local officials there went after him because he wouldn't print T shirts with the gay pride to them\nAnd he will print teachers for any person but he won't go overall message is there's other messages eastern down over the years\nHe found them another T shirt shop to deliver the exact same shirt and the exact same price um but that wasn't good enough it wasn't that they wanted to be entitled to have their shirts which they clearly God\nThey wanted to have a pound of flesh to go with it and so they're trying to punish planets and hopefully we won that case in the court of appeals [noise] um and hopefully that will be affirmed in the Kentucky Supreme Court if if not\nWe'll be taking that keeps us for it\nI I just saw an unbelievable number um how how many uh different attorneys do you put out in the field to defend these cases with the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nThat we have a sixty attorneys on staff and three thousand allied attorneys that I'm going to hear their time sometimes it reduced rate sometimes absolutely free but we have a big team that are willing to come in and and help Christians and other people all over the country\nWho have a real religious freedom and freedom of speech problems\nWell that's a that's a very a very significant um army if you have the three thousand volunteer attorneys\nAnd by the way we're we're talking to you because right now today is friday we are going into the weekend you will feel great and you'll have more reason to celebrate and feel grateful over the weekend if you can do something to um\nTo help the alliance defending freedom go to our website at Michael midday dot com you can read more about their fascinating work and some of these important cases\nAnd see what this great organization led by Michael ...

dollars today like magic it becomes\nTwo thousand dollars to help continue the fight for old Nathan ... to talk about another name can we talk a little bit about that case\nSure Nathan's student at Cal State University in San Marcos and he's the president of a pro life group on campus that she thought\nFor a pro life speaker of the student body has a rule and process where they found all organizations all all groups are supposed to be on equal basis\nBut as it turns out normally equals not equal the pro life groups was denied any funding for speaker but the gay lesbian groups received over about a quarter of a million dollars in round numbers\nWave a quarter of a million dollars for ... years and\nAll the other groups combined received around thirty thousand dollars and so the groups that are\nPushing the progressive message [laughter] really two groups who received the lion's share of the money and this is the money taken from every student in student fees is like a tax on public school ... college campuses\nSo so what what are you suing for what's the relief you're seeking for Nathan opera doc\nI'm seeking all the relief for open mic on these kinds of cases\nIs the end the practice of collecting student fees for for these kind of purposes they just need to stop there being administered and such uneven fashion that they become nothing more than a propaganda tool for the left and its students of all stripes that are being forced to fund these propaganda machines\nOkay it's so important to get updated on all this stuff you can find information on our website at

more unequal and income and opportunity migrants with languishing the kind of squalid poverty\nThat the United states hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably a conservative estimate that would defeat any conceivable tax and transfer program\nOkay this is the core argument simply allowing people in is a disaster for the country and it's not a a blessing for the people who are allowed in because\nBy encouraging more and more and more and more immigration with no limit\nWhat you're doing is undermining undermining the vitality and prosperity and
