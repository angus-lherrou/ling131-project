give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight five seven\nIf you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael Pincus on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress and we're finding out about the damage that every day stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nUh I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nForward talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list\nMagnesium is probably the most important vitamin on a planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if there was a low levels of magnesium your heart beat who very important factor in life\nYou would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes\nFibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis getting a list just goes on and on and on\nAnd then this this is associated with a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with no what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which has calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other out there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said he drank so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night it works\nBetter than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you during the day after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain okay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and the case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic pain fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back\nPain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what\nHappened is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency spin the nuclear museum they don't absorb but their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more arrests or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting on life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah in your body that actually started to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nKelsey Mays and let me tell you and it is simple problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the count max formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take to sort of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink is cut down this great absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nAll right and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium

viruses the colds and the flu will here today to share his health secrets\nFor shielding against viruses colds and the flu is Dr Michael ... is great to see it again Chris it's great to be here you know most of you probably know the doctor can it gives us a nationally recognized authority on both natural and alternative health he's also very successful chiropractor he's been son out my top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns so Dr because what is this how secret that you've been talking about\nWell what the secretive is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C.\nVitamin C. or I Will uh vitamin C is is not really new though no vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell and unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends in the bottom line is with out enough item in the end the right type of vitamin C.\nU. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies diabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be short\nBy six years but but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contains about sixty five milligrams\nOf vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three to four thousand yeah and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice so because of a lack of vitamin C. they were getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well the number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just don't any energy I don't feel like myself I'm hurting yeah and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we've got to do these tasks send you through the scanner\nAnd the problem is is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd it was interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C.\nAll right and the other ones there are any pigs primates and the fruit bat when you look at the rest of the animals out there you don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure you don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the\nTime right all those animals make their own vitamin C. huh and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nYeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it you know right\nBut you know I think most people myself included sinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is that you know what it\nIs actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my super see twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down to have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... is your body needs different forms of it and I put it all into one\nVitamin formula now and you said that was how much vitamin C. and your super see Tony to foreigners Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're going to experiences energy vitamin C. produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is okay if I read an email to sure sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped\nIt he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days he said no another thing that happened is I became more alert and I now have a clear head off from vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nI Want to let your listeners know that if you want to get a free book about vitamin C. N. try Dr ... super see twenty two formula absolutely risk free there is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with a vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I did go to the supermarket before\nI got here [laughter] okay and I brought some vitamin C. and I went and bought these and\nI'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in it so it right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well it's just one type of score but gas it right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... now cellulose has grown up newspaper\nOr the next one is uh vegetables Derek Ghassan now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form of\nA and the next one is a silica silica sand sand like the beach\nSorry so here's another one try this one here okay so this is a national brand here right right so this was five hundred milligrams okay this is a virtual yes All right so take a look at the ingredients okay I'm person gr is sucrose sugar okay ... sure sodium a score right\nThat's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium right vegetables Ericka said that that lubricant again and effort DNC yellow number six there you go number six so now that's artificially colored vitamin C.\nNow what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different from these that we are talking about\nWell what's different about as I used twenty two different forms of vitamin C. and it's all naturally flavored natural colors there's nothing artificial in it Chris so it's good for you and it's the only one that has this unique delivery method of being able to drink it down as water soluble goes right to work in your body and it has\nThe proper amount of vitamin C. per survey there's Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving ... there's nothing else on the market like it I've done tons of research vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies and it's really survive the test of time and what are these studies suggest what are they saying well I'll give you I'll give you a couple of headlines\nThis study was conducted at the University of California and it found that people who to the vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease were reduced over forty percent ... a steady reported in the international journal vitamin a nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes out ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C. and their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Miller leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day\nHad an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker if you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system or energy that's just from vitamin C. wow\nNow earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work\nWell this is the kind of

Y.\n\nHas been a rising star in the labor party and it's now become its leader secretary and he literally has only to find himself throughout his entire political history and it's been like Thirty years\nAs a friend and author of people who we know to be genocidal Arab jihadist terrorists\nAnd this has been above board has never tried to hide it and he has spoken out on numerous occasions with anti Jewish anti Israel pro Palestinian pro Hamas pro Hezbollah activities words and deeds\nBut like Tesla he nonetheless continues to\nIt's in the steam of his colleagues in the labor party\nAnd voters and this is a very frightening thing for the Jews of the United kingdom\nShould also be frightening for British citizens everywhere but it's not [noise] and ironically and tragically me now is literally one election away from being prime minister\nNow ... it's important to note that he is welcome Hezbollah and Hamas leaders to speak at the British Parliament and he's calling his friends [noise] um he he has praised\nThe release of ... prisoners which Israel was forced to do it two thousand twelve um he when he was in Tunisia just\nA couple of years ago four years ago twenty fourteen they put a read on the mint Oreo ... of the graves of the black ... if the people who killed the Israeli Olympic\nContestants in Munich in Nineteen Seventy two\nHe um has has received money from Arab a very wealthy who are associated with it have contributed to Hamas and if it is this is all about board it's all in the newspapers and he's never apologized for it and he has always been\nVery straight about the fact that\nHe supports the people who wants to destroy Israel\nHe thinks that the Jews are not real British citizens and he has a host of other comment\nAlso associate associated with Holocaust didn't lawyers and I'm with people who've written grossly anti Semitic books and articles about Israel about Jews about the Holocaust didn't happen but it's too bad that I didn't finish the job\nAnd ... it's it's it's too for that blood chilling to see that he is now literally one step away from being prime minister\nSo David are you saying you actually states said he supports the murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel\nUnreliable uses words but when he says the has the leaders of my friends they are my heroes I honor them\nI invite them to meet with me in England to speak at parliament when he puts a reef on the grave of the people who killed the Israeli athletes that's what he is and this is how British press has interpreted it\nBut it's not a little bit less of a rising star of the Labour Party and this has caused considerable discomfort\nAmong um the Jews of the u._k.\nI don't want to go into more detail all the things he thought it was that if anybody's interested email you and you can email me and I'll be happy to provide all the details and all the sources and references to the various British statement of what the main thing for us is that right now\nAs of last poll which was literally a few months ago forty seven percent of the labor list that is the people in the labor party\nWho are actively involved in the governing a kingdom they favor Corbett\nWhen asked by one of the callers well wait a minute what about all this nasty anti Jewish stuff the response was what for me as a blood Shelley well who you know that's just Jeremy being shared me you know he said well he is but he's still a very good leader and he's helping us anyway but\nIt doesn't matter to them that he is anti Jewish anti\nIsrael to the point of supporting the people who want to it and I only seven million Jews Jews if Israel explaining\nForty seven percent that's almost half\nHalf of the labor delicate to operate in the in the British Government as members of the Labour Party supporting [noise] now this has been a terrible shock to the Jews and a number of Jewish leaders have spoken out\nOkay we're going to have to get into that speaking out after the break here where of course we're slaves to the computer here we are coming up on the first break the today show you\nListening to the middle east radio form here on nine sixty the Patriot my name is William wolf I alternate most or Sundays with marriage all of those ... river coast here and I very much appreciate the fact that he shares this microphone with me\nAnd it's always a ask you to please let me bring the show to you we are now starting to sixteen year or Middle East radio formulas to show started in October of two thousand three\n[noise] All right well David our people other than the Jewish community speaking out against carbon\nNot in any significant numbers new new dentist ... bay there had been in some of the local small newspapers in various parts of England there'd been a editorials condemning him\nBut then you make the mainstream media but very slow I'm you know and leadership and then they're not getting on the stage of British politics\nSo the answer is when it comes to being having an influence yeah [noise]\nSo in your opinion is he going to win the next election for prime minister\nI Can't say he is going to I'm going to say that he has a very very good chance of winning the next election not because\nHe is an anti Semite but despite the fact that he is an anti Semite and probably because the current party the conservative party has been very badly damaged by ... and buy a number of problematic moves that the prime minister may has made\nYou wanna get into that it's too complicated for now and it's more important for us to talk about America but yes he has a really really good chance of being ...\nOkay start talking about America we are coming close to the break I'll have to stop you in about a minute but ...\nSo what I what what I Want to point out now is that to the best of my knowledge I've been researching this for quite a while the American Democratic Party is following in the labor parties but\nQuietly but nonetheless very clearly and this is a very frightening thing we may be like about ten years behind them five I'm not sure but we are going in that direction and I say we because up until John Kerry ran for office with a lifelong Democrat\nStores it along the Democrats the especially the young and some very beautiful women of color\nAre rising are arriving on what I call the left side of the Iraq they are people who are reflecting a very strong left wing so called progressive\nApproach to American politics thirty seconds please\nYeah they they they they are a new wave they are a grievance power with the political group and they are a identity politics ... it was dying is though\nIs traditionally a problem for both of those groups the identity group and the grievance group the costs the Palestinians have become

I guess David Mayer leaving day be were\nThey were talking about the Democratic party now we're gonna compared to the Democratic party ... parents and also you were talking about these new rising stars in the Democratic party that are very very apparently pro Palestinian and that will be by definition anti Israel\nIsrael yes okay um I just said it new rising stars are left wing they're pulling the party more radically towards the left\nLet's take a look briefly what that means in broad terms and then we'll go into more detail based on information um by the Christians United for Israel which address permission from a pack recent polls show that having the five percent of Republicans support Israel\nThirty three percent of Democrats support Israel\nThirty three percent of Democrats are anti Israel and thirty four percent undecided but there's me is that what you're looking at a situation which Regan first is the Democratic party of our parents or grandparents they hold your\nSixty seven percent of Democrats are either anti are undecided about Israel better words they do not support Israel\nOnly thirty three percent Seventy five Republicans support Israel to reverse of what it was Twenty years ago\nYeah they they they they probably gets worse because the trend is toward the access to a patient left these numbers evangelicals who have been a supportive of Israel since the very beginning bases ... theology\nAre needing in their own polls and publications\nThat the younger generation of evangelicals raised in that jail church are nonetheless heavily influenced by pro Palestinian propaganda the idiot Palestinians as a press or the victims and Israel is the oppressors evicted lives are\nTherefore as they hit the younger generation you can do all the older guys got it wrong the Christian thing to do to support the Palestinian this is like\nI said the reverse of what it used to be\nIn and David let me interrupt viewers argument because that's exactly the position of J Street they look at Israel as the oppressor and the Palestinians as being the oppressed and this is a so called and I say so called Jewish group\nAnd and the problem is apropos what you just said which is quite correct many young ... was like children and grandchildren are actually\nEat exactly that way\nAnd they have forgotten forty eight fifty six sixty seven they enlist Arab diatribe the eldest Arab commitment to the NIH elation of every chew in Israel that sort of as in the background hazy memory is short yeah the editor\nHis pretending to be anti Israel but is in fact the the the um loud speaker to the American public for the anti Israel Arab Palestinian propaganda\nDo you mean they're pretending to be pro Israel\nProtect you know the pro Israel but instead of being the loudspeaker at the mouthpiece for the victory oh like\nPeter anti Israel propaganda\nSo when they come to a Congress person and say hey we're gonna do wish you a Congress person who considers the fact that Israel is America's most important ally in the middle east the only reliable ally in the middle east the only democracy in the middle east\nOught to be saying well wait a minute is this a good idea\nOr a bad idea that me learn more about J Street\nWhether that's happening with all the time to get control of Congress person or not I can't say but I can say that what is also happening is they look at the polls among their electricity I say aha J Street is really popular among the large number of Jews\nAlso really popular among a large number of non Jews so that'll probably get me more votes\nSo I Will accept that endorsement\nNow accept the endorsement of J Street you have made a political statement about the American relationship with Israel and how you're going to deal with it when it comes time to decide about their aid for Israel weapons for Israel support for Israel and the un\nA whole host of issues\nThis trend in the J Street endorsed it is it's far more dangerous than\nWhat the numbers themselves just relax reflect it tells us also that more and more Democrats in government state\nAnd federal\nAre willing to step away from my commitment to the support for Israel\nAnd except what is in essence anti Semitic\nPropaganda as part of their ... now another really frightening to change which is hardly even mentioned in the in Spain analyze thoroughly in a number of other places especially I'm happy to say front page magazine which I had the editor of writing four years ago\nThat there's a new element to the Democratic party card the D. S. hey the Democratic socialist\nAssociation socialist says when is the Democratic party social\nRuining my Bernie Sanders who a route\nOr you go for at least that is an excellent example he refused to speak it back during during during his candidacy for president it was the only one invited to refuse to speak\nIs a political statement that tells those constituents who he hopes will vote for him that\nHe is stepping away from creating daylight between himself and Israel\nSo who are the constituency is looking to get votes from anti Israel people people whether they're Jewish or not whether they're pro Jewish or anti Jewish doesn't matter they feel like it's better for America to disassociate from Israel at least to some degree this is incredibly to enter\nMuch more dangerous long term for the whole us they are in the whole nation is that the Democratic socialist and the Democratic party\nAll of this seems to be like Bernie Sanders moving toward a socialist economy and a socialist re interpretation\nOf how our country works and they overwhelmingly in terms of polls that have been conducted support ATF yeah it it makes it a little bit which wants to undermine Israelis\nBoycott the ... thing should\nSanctions right now this is a major move it it has much more power than we realize just as J Street to so much so that at a recent rally at least in the Democratic party where he beat is presented for speaking\nMembers of the party not bbs people but members of the Democratic socialist party chanted follow the river to the sea Palestine will be free\nIn other words get rid of Israel destroyed\nWere for Israel and that's the area and it's okay with that yeah this is the probably again my opinion\nHopefully most extreme part of that thirty three percent that does not support Israel but it's a growing number\nAnd here is that big difference again that I mentioned if you go there isn't anyone any major leader any major mainstream outlet which is condemning which is\nContradicting which was telling us how dangerous it had\nOn like England where at least the Jews\nAre speaking out now it gets worse\nToday there are more than one hundred Muslim Americans running as Democrats for officers in the state and federal con\nYeah there's nothing wrong with a Muslim running for office at it's not a problem anymore than Jewish Christian or the high or whatever it doesn't matter how ever\nAbout a dozen of those are those of those candidates have already spoken out before believe vocally written and and had it in their their rallies stroll anti Israel common\nAnd they have associated themselves\nHolding hands ... hugging shaking hands appearing together on a dance with non\nElected I Would say social leaders in the story of being the most ... standing and there was feral honeybee in the second most upstanding who either themselves not just anti Israel but ... outspoken anti Jewish\nWhen you invite far beyond just stand with you on that day is what you're giving a speech and you refer to him as a friend you are saying that you do not object to\nHis really brutal anti Jewish comment that have been typical of him for decades\nIs that's similar to Obama being in the church or whoever yeah\nYeah exactly it is very similar there is an association of people say oh about guilt by association but no this is not killed by this was killed by choice to associate with we are not say oh he's associated with that person we are saying I think\nHe has intentionally meet this person a partner\nThe image that he producers for the American voters that he knows that this person has been an outspoken anti Semite for decades\nNow in the south shore another example\nHad the [laughter] I I Want to call the desk and everything is so I'd asked that he put the shameless to stay publicly well you know um where do you have white American cops shooting unarmed black American boy the Jewish hand is behind that\nThat's an incredible statement for anybody in this country to make in the twenty first century\nMaybe that's how she became the darling of J Street\nWell I can address that 'cause I don't know exactly\nI said I Can't get a book that in mind J Street but I Can't say that anyone then who supports her who gives her positions of power votes or for example to become the leader\nOf the some of the feminist movement that she's involved in is saying I'm going to ignore that or I agree with that\nThey're not saying wait that's not acceptable\nIt's that not saying that creates a gigantic problem for a running out of time when he had to put a couple of other things to anyone who wants to lift the key players that I mentioned just email you email me I'll send it to him I did not all one hundred I got about a dozen or really problematic in danger\nAnd then of course radio forum already I O F O R U M at AOL dot com go ahead David\nOkay so that the problem that we have is that among those that are the dangerous ones the ones who say oh for Italy I Want to get rid of Israel or\nI I Want to make this opinion is I'm going to cut off Israel aid they all of them have received money from George Soros and they all have\nEither direct or indirect association with people who represent or support major international terrorist organization\nHamas [noise] that's below ISIS\nAny credible but they do and this is part of the reason why they accept\nGeorge Soros has written openly spoken up is eighty six years old he it's amazing is still functioning but he says I Want to have I wouldn't trade it I wouldn't use my wealthy millionaire I wouldn't use my wealth to create a new world order and I want socialism to replace\nIn Korea lose I'm I'm a ... ... the consumerism all the stuff that he thinks is of course he got rich because of those things but never mind [laughter]\nSo he supports these candidates with a lot of money and that's not always but in many cases that become overt uh for example the workers running for Congress in Texas\nGot a hundred and twenty six thousand from somewhere else but he got invited Jake ...\nSoros came late to chase me through the courts ... pretty much the main supporter and eat and J Street gave money to\nOut of your retirement while supplies last also give you a copy of our free safe money book\nThe book that talks about putting your retirement on auto pilot by

three\nHere's another question for you why would you invest your money and bonds stocks or mutual funds\nEasy answer right people think they must risk their money to get good returns they want big returns\nYou know what they're really sad thing about African planning or investing in products where you can lose your money is it there's so much risk with very little real return\nHere's an example from the past my interest you in a study by ... the nation's leading financial services market research firm from Nineteen eighty five to two thousand and for the average mutual fund investor achieved a three point seven percent and the allies to return\nIf you're at or near retirement is losing fifty percent of your money worth an average return a three point seven percent\nThe truth is that the numbers you hear on the news I rarely the ones you participate in after fees investment restriction and fun choices most investment accounts never perform as good as the market the truth is that your two thousand four could be today\nYou don't know when the market's gonna crash\nYou don't know when it's going to turn your paper gains in the real losses at a critical stage of your retirement unfortunately many people find out way too late to protect your money after the age of forty five should have been a priority\nMy income planning will show you how to get guaranteed returns without the risk of market last\nWell it's time to take a short break this is James ... and you're listening to save money radio that's positive or some exciting enough [noise]\nDo you realize that even a minor recurring fee of two percent of your portfolio can cost you up to\nOne third of your retirement savings [noise] if you are now paying a two percent of the that adds up to thirty three percent of your retirement savings lost to broker fees thinking about it [noise] thirty three cents of every dollar you said will be lost before you even enter into retirement\nTenet doesn't end there that seemed to present the costs you another thirty three percent while you're in your retirement\nSo ask yourself just whose retirement and my saving for stop financing someone else's retirement\nUp the phone and call us now one\nPiece for for three seven on and say that's paid for for free seven one seven to three three [noise]\n\nYou're listening to save money radio with your host James Herb's welcome back in time James hurts your host of save money radio no market risk retirement specialist working with clients right here in the valley of the sun [noise]\nOne of the things I like most about what I Do is it I don't have to pitch my clients with hopes and dreams based on speculation before you listen to anybody about your finances\nShouldn't you ask yourself what exactly do they know and what are the guessing too many retirees get confused by all the double talk and think about what they're hearing from their financial officials they think it's fact when it's really only a guess let me ask you at this stage of your life\nShould you gamble with your life savings on a gas\nTommy now at age four four three seven one safe I'll show you how you never need the gas about your retirement again\nMy safe money information cat it'll show you how to base your retirement on fact and not fiction\nHow would you like up to ten percent bonus on your deposit now up to seven percent compound an annual interest rate\nFor a lifetime income account that provides you income you can never outlive last supplies last you may also get a copy of our safe money book learn how to put your retirement on auto pilot and get rid of the high fees and market risk\nOnce again our number is eight four four three seven one safe\nThat's eight four four three seven one seven to three three\nI have a great story for you it's a perfect example of what happens when you retirement is based on guessing instead of guarantees unless you're called me the other day and said that their broker told them not to worry about a market declined because market declines are only paper losses\nI asked the color is your broker tell you not to get excited when the stock market goes up\nBecause it's only a paper games can you believe that not only is the paper last statement about the most sensitive thing you could say that somebody who just lost their money but it's also not even true\nIf you need the money now is that a paper last er an actual loss\nIf your age forty five and above\nYou need to start looking at guarantees the closer you are to retirement the last time you have to recover from the guessing game the last time you have to recover from all last\nYear after year I meet with clients that put their money in the hands of so called experts only to find out that their financial planner had no idea the market was gonna crash\nHere's a secret about me I don't know when the market's gonna crash either to you\nOf course not if I had a magic wand my first should be to make everyone including your broker stop pretending like they know what's gonna happen next the truth is brokers politicians are any proclaimed expert has no idea when the market's going to go up\nOr when the
