R. Y. doubled G. H. E. T.\n\nRight so it's it's the feel so comfortable and secure and everything is taken care of\nNow\nOne of the prices you pay is with you know you pretty much have to think like everybody else you know think of a box\nAnd you just in my life becomes this is me I'm not reading from the article life becomes I've often said about Western Europe life becomes really a debate about how many hours I couldn't get off how much vacation time I couldn't have how much I can travel\nAnd it sounds awesome adjust I mean what could be better I work less\nI'm taking care of this is utopia\n\nThan me continue six months ago my two year old niece broke her leg the physician who treated the girl told my brother in law that his daughter would be given a full body seep the scan to which you might say huh\nShe broke her leg and the doctor wants to give the the girl a full body seat the scan the doctor insisted that procedure was mandatory but not for any medical reason I Wonder if a single woman fuel assuming knows the reason\nThe doctor ordered a full body seep T scan of a two year old girl\nThat's a lot of radiation by the way a a two year old girl gets a full body scan for a broken leg\nEverybody I Know the reason there's no way you don't think there's any one of the I ... I couldn't catch fire was thinking why she's getting a full body see peace can write the doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory\nGet it mandatory he had no choice\nBut not for any medical reason rather the Swedish social services administration\n\nRequires such scans to look for evidence of child abuse while the doctor did note that they're broken leg was the result of an accident\n\nKeep told my brother in law\nThe matter was out of my hands\nThat is the doctor saying that it is out of my hands I have no say on whether your daughter gets to see peace ... when the girl's parents refused to subject to this unnecessary procedure the hidden machinery of the Swedish welfare state spring into action\n[noise] my brother in law and his wife were required to attend multiple interviews with social workers and to submit friends and neighbors in in their small town for questioning\n\nSocial workers even inspected their home suddenly decisions is benign is ... milk to by seeing potential evidence of parental proficiency my inlaws feared that there are two children might be taken from them\n\nThis is the great experiment of the United states the great experiment is liberty liberty in God we trust people assume our more like coal American trinity wrote a book on the American troops he still the best hope\nPeople are not necessarily in sync with us\n\nTake care of people take care of my if you take care of me\nTake care of my children\nTo why people are home schooled their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the state should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues our because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of\nPeople but to take care take being taken care of\nNow obviously there's there's got to be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say may offend me there's another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of\nBeing taken care of\nI don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay [noise]\nAh let's go to a are too doesn't agree so he gets on

a writer named Neil Patel like and it comes out the same week\nThat a new study comes out from Canada is published in the American Journal of psychiatry it's peer reviewed it is a very very alarming scientific study\nIt makes it clear that marijuana does more damage to teenage brains for teenagers who use marijuana\nThan alcohol\nBy the way it doesn't mean that alcohol is a good idea for teenagers is it ... it is it and no don't somebody bringing up Brett Kavanaugh\nLook at it most parents understand that it's not great for kids had fourteen Fifteen sixteen to be using alcohol\nBut it's even worse for them to be using marijuana yes even in states where that might be illegal by the way I don't think there are any of the legal marijuana states where it's legal for people under Eighteen\nOr is this is um the peace in the New York times when I'm Talking about is by a guy name Neal Pollack\nWho's a writer he writes very well and he has an intention getting headline it's obese

THC and the caffeine at the same time then I took another hit and another\nIn the afternoons I smoke a bowl or papa gummy bear or both that by the way is not the kind of gummy bears that you'd normally give to children\nAt night I got high before eating dinner or watching the ball game maybe I've stopped getting stoned a little bit before bed but what was the point if I went to bed high I could wake up high too\nLike most pot addicts in denial\n\nI spent a year is telling myself that marijuana isn't addictive and so I didn't have a problem but clearly I did\nAnd I'm not the only one who suffers this way\nThough marijuana addiction isn't deadly like opioid addiction or toxic like math addiction it's still wastes millions of lives\nAround nine percent of even casual users become addicted\nAnd about Seventeen percent of those who starred as teenagers\n\nOkay something worried about these statistics that he's using those statistics are based on an article that was published\nIt might be eight or nine years ago but it's it's an article published in the journal and the American Medical Association it's been looked over its been peer reviewed it is a solid article on a solid analysis here's what they show\nThat if you take the total number of even occasional marijuana use is if you take people who take even one joint\nGetting high once nine percent of those people that many many millions of people will become addicted to marijuana that means that they're dependent on it that means you have to struggle to quit\nThat means you have a need your body develops a need for

start using pot of teenagers become addicted\nHe says I started smoking regularly in the Nineteen nineties when I was in my mid twenties pot made everything better food music sex cleaning and it made nothing worse\nI got the press less often I left all the time sounds great huh well he goes on\nBut it also lost my temper for no reason did I yell at strangers in public probably I barely remember because I was stoned all the time\nBut I Do remember that once high as a promotional blimp I got into a bar fight with a former friend and broke his tooth with a beer bottle\nBack when my writing career was booming I got invited a couple of times to do readings in Amsterdam a bad gig for a pot addict\nOnes after ingesting a couple of THC pills I dumped a pitcher of water over my head and
