their sex so welcome indeed to the show today's topic is\nOne that just ignores at me and I want to balance it all fuel\nThe messages that we give to young women and have by the way since I was in college so this is not new you should pursue career and that should be the primary concern that you have\nAs a young woman and even not as a young woman as you as you get into your thirties which is still relatively young but\nNot young young\nAnd you know ... or somebody a good man comes along that's fine that's great you know if you know\nNobody says throwaway but that's not where you're\nAttentions and effort should be directed they should be directed toward a fulfilling career a successful career which means making as much money as possible it's what the word successful generally connotes unfortunately but it does\nSo I Am curious if you're a woman who followed that advice and you know moral a single minded leave pursued career success was that good for you in the long run\nSecondarily I'm asking what do you think we should say to young women because I'll tell you what I Would say to a young woman\nThis is the prime time for you to find a good man you should be at least as concerned with that as you are with career success\nThat's why I ask well by the way the phone number is one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six that's why I ask you a women when I meet them so often a waitress or even somebody sitting next to them in the airplane\nAnywhere wherever the opportunity arises I have no difficulty in fact I Love speaking to strangers so this is the relevance to me so I'll say hey can I ask you how old are you ... twenty five bucks a perfect so here's my question\nAnd some of you heard of this all ready and the question is if you could get be guaranteed one of two things which guarantee would you take I always tell them is no right answer I'm just I Want to know how you think\nAnd I also tell them that even though one is guaranteed that doesn't mean the other camp happened it just means only one is guaranteed so if you could be guaranteed a great career or a great marriage which guaranteed or would you choose the that's the way I put\nSo\nThat's my question one eighth Prager seven seven six so they're really too well one is what if you're a woman what message did you get and what did you follow in this regard\nTo what do you think the message should be too young women because I Know what the message is the societal message is\nPursue pursue a vocation pursue a career\nAnd you know for a

know the right man comes along and that'll be fine\nIt's not\nEither they're not telling me the whole truth and they really would like to get married or they really think that it's not that important\nAnd I think that society I I'll tell you where I'm coming from I think you know but I'll just say that the way I think that society has played a terrible trick of young women and has since I was a young man I've this is not new at all\nThis this is part of the transformation of society that took place in the late sixties and then the seventies\nIt it was the if the dream of most

Los Angeles international airport a shooting at the Jewish Federation Seattle they're shooting at a Jewish community center a Kansas City in a shooting at the Holocaust museum\nLower levels of vandalism and violence have been even more common it's true the death toll in Pittsburgh was especially high but that's just happenstance any of the other shooters would have been happy to kill as many or more\nSecond\nThe Trump Administration include some very strong opponents of anti Semitism UN ambassador Nikki Haley is for the anti Semitism in the world body\nOne of the world's primary purveyor of it with a vigorous effectiveness not seen at least since Daniel Patrick Moynihan Trump appointee Ken Marcus head of the department of education office of civil rights has devoted much of his career to fighting anti Semitism\nThose who wish to blame Trump have an ace in the whole\nAn Anti Defamation league study that purports to show an almost sixty percent increase in anti Semitic incidents between twenty sixteen twenty seven team which is implicitly blamed on Trump this study has been cited over and over in response to ... to Pittsburgh\nThere were several problems with relying on this study for Trump bashing however the first is that the study includes one hundred and Ninety three incidents of bomb threats to Jewish institutions as anti Semitic incidents even though by the time the deal published the study it had been conclusively shown\nThat the two perpetrators of the bomb threats were not motivated by anti Semitism\nI'll tell you and I told you this many times about Ninety percent of those bomb threat to the Jewish community centers were Colin by an American Jewish kid with a mental problems living in Israel you have a ten percent were black radical\n... and yet the a deal as he writes one can only guess why the ... chose to inflate it statistics in this way\nBut none of the explanations speak well of the ideal second the the L report itself acknowledges that some of the rising incidents may simply be due to better reporting quote more people are reporting incidents to a deal than ever before unquote third quote\nCollege campuses so a total of two hundred and four incidents and twenty Seventeen compared to one hundred and eight and twenty six team unquote\nHe continues to right professor Bernstein how many of those incidents emanating from traditional forms of anti Semitism that one might associate with the Trump being populism and how many from leftist pro Palestinian sources the A. B. L. doesn't say\n\nYou ... I Hope you you're following this point it's rather important oh look at all this increase of anti Semitism on the Trump and then site a doubling of incidents of anti Semitism on college campuses Ninety nine percent of which I probably induced by the left and by Muslim students\n\nFor the ... big you was incidents as anti Semitic incidence so long as they were reporters such for example the report states quote Jewish graves or cemeteries were desecrated seven times in twenty seven team\nThe desecration of Jewish headstones is a classic anti Semitic act employed for hundreds of years\nThe majority of the cemetery desecration occurred in the first months of the year at the same time as the bomb threats were cold is a Jewish institutions which contributed to a sense that the Jewish American community was under siege unquote\nAfter say a Jew American Jew or have not felt under siege for\nYou know hey I'm a conservative so I think differently which is true I Do I think that for weeks correct corporate clearly\nThe problem is the desecration of cemeteries of all faiths is not uncommon\n\nAnd are often the product of either bored teenagers or veterans in fact at least some of the cemetery incidents counted by the ... were ultimately determined by police not to be anti Semitic in origin the desecration of a cemetery in St Louis got particularly large amount of attention\nThere's a very terrible thing folks this is fake news get it we are behaving in fake news\n\nIn the wake of the risk massacre in Pittsburgh on Saturday many commentators are blaming President Trump for cultivating an atmosphere in which anti Semitism flourishes\nDana Milbank I'm a Washington Post won so far to claim the Jews are not safe in Donald Trump's America that's correct with a ... piece in the Washington Post by a heater ... Dana Milbank she's just a plain hater\nThe amount of aid from the left in ... the amount of aid from the right towards there's no comparison the problem is that no sound empirical data exist that shows an increase in anti Semitism during the Trump Administration how do you like that\nThat would justify such claims all the data that does exist like a much cited a study proves no such thing\nUndoubtedly many readers are silently protesting what about the ... statistics showing a fifty seven percent increase it anti Semitic incidents and twenty seven team a finger reported by NPR the New York times the Washington Post and many other media outlets\nIn fact that's not what this study shows wait a minute you meet NPR the New York times Washington Post a line no professor Bernstein that's not possible not to not possible they wouldn't lie\nIn fact I saw what the study shows and despite the way it's been reported in the ... own press release the actual findings don't even support the show any such thing\nMost important to study does not actually claimed to count anti Semitic incidences such but rather the reporting of these events\nFirst it purports to count those incidents that had been reported to the ... by the media law enforcement and the public\nThe NBA knowledge is that some of the increase in document that incidence is not an actual increase butter results from court or people reporting incidents to a deal than ever before second report this not count only actual anti Semitic incidents but any incidents that results quote\nIn Jews perceiving themselves as being victimized due to their Jewish identity unquote\nAs a result of this methodological take the deal tally includes a hundred sixty three bomb threats made the Jewish community center ... students early twenties Seventeen even the two perpetrators were not motivated by anti Semitism\nRelated lead twenty Seventeen stolen usually high level of concern and the Jewish community over perceived threats a result of both Trump's victory and the J. C. C. called Jewish community center\n\nThis likely lead to an increase in ambiguous incidents being reported to the ab yells anti Semitic we know for example that one purported example of anti Semitic cemetery vandalism turned out to be just old stones toppling over from poor upkeep\nTo the aid the delete it that one from its tally and another turn out to be the product of a drunken mad I read this to you from the other article he wrote individual with no anti Semitic content ... not delete that formed from its tally\nThen of course it's the campuses right which is overwhelmingly from the left\nIs even more dramatic refutation of the a deal study that I Will take your calls\nIs named being deal I'm Dennis\nDennis Springer show live from the release and your brain freeze [noise]\nNine six the news\nWith Oreo con sitter fat Robert Bauer of the entire\nFour pound out some funny nine and a half and he\nSaid only diamond includes charges for religious hate crimes firearms and causing injury to police officers power is due to appear in a second hearing in federal court in Pittsburgh tomorrow\nCampaigning is intensifying across the U.S has the midterm elections are less than a week away President Trump has more than ten rallies schedule before next Tuesday's elections\nFormer President Obama and former vice president Joe Biden are also Criss crossing the U.S speaking of elections today is the last day for Arizona voters to get early ballots into the mail ballot mailed after today might not be delivered in time to be counted on election day November six anyone\nWho Memphis today the mainland deadline can drop off their ballot than any polling place on election day a Turkish prosecutor says Washington Post columnist Jamal 'cause Shelby was strangled then dismembered shortly after entering a thought he constantly in his stumble on October second\nStatement front of the prosecutor called the murder premeditated and say ... body wants this number to dispel this stuff 'cause he was a Saudi citizens with resident status in the U.S he was very critical of the Saudi Government\nAnd three D.

I Will share some of the lyrics and then you can hear how well what it sounds like though actually seeing the music video which I'm the music video features footage of Morocco Obama crying I Believe he was crying at the Newtown massacre\nAnd she makes it look as if he's crying at just the Trump presidency in general by the way the Newtown massacre did not occur under President Trump it occurred under President Obama\nBut I'm here the lyrics of don't lie to me and uh this is a definitely an album with a message if ... if you're one of those people who thinks you were going to be influenced in this upcoming election by Barbra Streisand\nAnd her opposition to President Trump you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nHere the lyrics why can't you just tell

that\nThe music business is changing and people are listening to music on Spotify and download something and you can listen to it once and then throw it away but the core of the music business for a very very long time and I say a long time [noise]\nAh oh going on two hundred years I mean really for a very long time okay a hundred and fifty years\nThe um the music business has been about getting music that you want to keep\nAnd listen to\nAnd enjoy and um I Know this again last night um I came home I went to see a new film which we're going to review on friday with my wife\nAnd we came home from the film and we were doing some work and I know we're ready to go to bed and I just had a again a to hear this particular very obscure piece of music\nAnd I I collect CDs I have a lot of a compact discs and um and and so I was able to find this eight Russian folk songs by ... totally Lee out off [laughter] it's a very obscure ... music and I wanted to share with Diane because she didn't know it and so I\nPut it on even though I Am and listen to the CD for a long time I was glad to have it because it's beautiful music can anyone imagine\n... said two years from now I say ten years from now where President Trump is no longer president he's term limited don't worry liberal ceased to term limited what someone want to put on this song don't lie to me about president\nTrump to hear more of this can you imagine sitting down in your living room in the middle of the night and saying yeah let's let's share the the musical experience of\nI I think that they the Democrats should employee this song in campaign events [noise]\nUh no I meant that Democrats should because that would absolutely ensure that people are in the right mood of despair and\nI see I don't get this I don't get it and look I I I knew Barbara Streisand years ago I actually worked with her at one point and by the way she's a very nice person\nShe is not a mean evil nasty person at all or she has kind she's considerate and I think most people who haven't had any experience dealing with her on a personal basis I Will tell you that\nAnd it's sad for me to see this\nAnd and I'll tell you why I I I Know that Barbara has serious aspirations as an artist but somebody ought to tell her somebody ought to tell everybody on the left there's no lasting art there is no art of lasting value that has created for the politics of the moment\nDo you do okay honestly because it has a very\nAnd the heat\nMega have him and then asked can you think of anything good Trump has done\nAnything\nAnd that says a very long pause and then she says I mean this is a man who's kind of not kind of he's just mean I worry about the children I worry about what is the image east projecting to them\nAnd then later in the interview she thought of something he'd done well and she said what he's done well you've asked me what I think he's good at he's good at marketing\nThen later she she says in the interview she blames Donald Trump or making her fat\nI'm not joking\nThe or the interview concludes with ... asking Barbara how are you seeing them these days and she says I Want to sleep nights if we take the house I'll be able to sleep a little bit better\nAnd then maybe he has and if they don't don't know I've been thinking about do I want to move to Canada I think she'd promise to move to Canada before Trump won the election I mean the presidential election and then she says I don't know if I moved to Canada\nI'm just so saddened by this thing happening in my country it's making me fat\nI hear what he said now and I have to go eat pancakes now and pancakes are very fattening we make them with healthy flower though I'm an flower coconut flower\nOkay good for her ... does anyone think it's fair to blame Donald Trump for making you\nFat and that's what she said ah let's go to Jeff in Seattle Jeff you're on the Michael ...\nMichael ... the the whole bomb thing going out and what Trump's saying you know fake news is evil or why are they the new people and the left as the opportunity word for trying to trying to put a face to the people who exactly are the liars risk of fake news is that\nLike

the\n... again I I I'll tell you I think you actually I understand what you're saying and I I Do believe that President Trump would gain\nA lot by inviting some of the people who have been most
