driven a car\nAnd anyway shopping for an SUV and I very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I have been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way be whatever it is it I'm now as we're having a new experience to haven't had in a while ago even car dealers and I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with the Internet I Want to I Want to do it with you know with car dealers [noise]\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there were almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance raw five I think for four or five the five were young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no\nBarris meant I'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up so uh as I said at the end I think that if this is all representative and it may not be fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\n\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that SUV can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the length of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like ... or I could always look it up on the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to

... that was one\nAspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even\nDeeper and that is that the there was there seemed to be an absence of passion\nI again I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales folks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these uh sales people get older young I I didn't have any sense of that but they were passionate about cars\nThere was it was they might as well have been working in a shoe store this is not a

people were basically good especially themselves they know that they are basically good because they're in lightened\nAnd therefore all the power that they could have will only be used benign only that is what they believe these people are fools by definition left this may be sweet they may be a whole host of things but to the extent that they have left wing views they're fools\nAnd foolishness begins with the belief\nThat power concentrated in a few people's hands if they are lightened enough is just wonderful they really do believe essentially in benign dictatorships\nThat's what they believe the founders believed in diffusion of power separation of powers\nThat's why we have a Congress that's why we have an executive and that's why we have a court that is also why we have a U.S Senate to diffuse power among the states the left hates the Senate hates the Senate\nBecause it doesn't just reflect majority will because after all Wyoming with with fewer and fewer than a million

majority of rich did not by the idea that Britain should seated sovereignty to a larger\nInstitution called the European Union\n\nA few believe people are basically good then it's great to concentrate power in a few people's hands if you don't believe people were basically good you have to be an idiot to concentrate all that power in a few people's hands\nBut as I said they believe in themselves if

John thanks very much for coming on the show a pleasure Michael have always okay right now uh uh\n... how many states approximately are people already sending in balance of course here in the state of Washington people are because all vote by mail\nThirty states have some form of early voting whether it's absentee or a you know showing up at a government office before the election\nOkay so let me put the word out to people anyone listening to us right now in one of those thirty eight states and you probably are\nAs don't wait sending your ballot get it done that way you you make sure you're making a contribution\nTo this important national decision the consensus seems to be on the part of everybody who's looking at this Johnson that the momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people had baked and the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump\nAnd I think that Trump's antics as a personality that depressed part of the Republican base but Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law\nI think that at best that show the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in a violating norms and politics and at worst\nAlmost extra constitutional so I think the prompt managed to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would be managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to cobra surprise on their feet and having to blow up in their face\nAnd yeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like Dean Heller or who is long considered our most endangered a center in the center for Nevada\nHe strongly supported Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and that appears to and giving him a boost I think they're running time now right now in Nevada aren't they\nI think of the election were held today Republicans would lose none of their seats and the only question is what the Democrats lose two three or four years\nWow which means that of course Republican control of the Senate what about on the house side\n[noise] I Would say the Democrats\nBecause of a variety of good factors including the fact that uh\nYou know suburban women become one of the most resistant groups against Trump twenty five point gender gap against them or we're against Republicans I think there are sixty percent chance to take back the house of sixty percent of a lot lower than it was two or three weeks ago because I think that\nAs the issues start to be talked about you to remember most of your listeners are into politics Michael you and I are into politics the average voter doesn't pay attentional took much closer to the election so when they\nActually look at the issues this center right country and if the Republicans frame the issues property they tend to close the gap in the last two weeks unless there's some extraneous about like the two thousand they financial meltdown\nOkay two two issues which are very much front and center at this moment uh one is the uh a legit ... horrible aghast at President Trump made last night and used and when he called himself a nationalist do you think this is going to alienate millions and millions of American voters\n[noise] I think it may be the hundreds and hundreds of reporters and journalist who are once again appalled by the fact that the president is\nYou know troll ... telling them I mean I'm notice when he said and he said I don't I'm not supposed to say it but I'll say that anyway I mean look the president may not be the most elegant speaker but boy does he know how to use language as a weapon\nOr ... whatever ears as a trigger where some of them like he he pulls the trigger\nRash and pulls the trigger on on then to wash their hands to explode and I it's just extraordinary I'd like to hear people I even offered to listeners to call up and say why nationalism was a bad word a one eight hundred nine ... Seventeen Seventy six our phone number go ahead\nIt has some bad historical antecedent but basically if another sending them and I think you've pointed this out for patriotism\nYeah of course a ... and again the first three Senate ... that are listed when you just click on it\nOn the Internet are national feeling a national uh as patriotic feeling pardon me patriotism and flag waving and uh nothing wrong with any of those three things what about we we had on yesterday and Eric eggers who\nIs a very concerned about uh the confusion in American voting registration suggesting that as many as twenty four percent\nUh of registered voters right now are really shouldn't be voting now you've written about this um extensively do you think that's a very big problem two weeks in the day\nIt depends on the state are you know I I hate to draw national brushing twenty four percent sure sounds high to me I think that the problem with voter fraud as it doesn't show up until the very end\nWhen election was closed and somebody gets desperate and they put their thumb on the scale and send the street money out and it all happens quickly at the very end\nYou know under the cover of a ... you know vans and everything else so we may not know what happens but we do know that we need to watch for it and if there's anything on toward these bad with these looks like in Georgia\nYou know these ... these are not people are being prevented from voting it just means they have to show up at the polls and fill out a provisional ballot and check and prevent their id it doesn't we're not preventing anyone from voting or just making sure the person who's voting is the person they say they are\nYeah I mean while I'm there is a um a this additional at any thirty six governorships that are up in in this election right now right\n[noise] yeah it's a big this is the big casino yeah and these these these governorships will help decide how redistricting is done\nAfter the next census switching to in two years\nRight which will also help to determine whoever wins what will be a very close election you don't think there's any chance the Democrats win more than thirty seats stay\nThere oh no no no in fact I think I think the governorships are going to be a lot of swaps they rip them across will take back some Midwestern states that have been in Republican control for a long time like Illinois\nAnd the Republicans are going to take back I think they're going to take back states where the Democrats are mismanaged the finances so bad that um you know they've given up any chance of governing but Connecticut by the way even Oregon even Oregon make elected Republican governor for the first time in Thirty years\nRight which would be amazing Buddhist Kate Brown ever deserve to be voted out of power in Oregon now there's one surprise to look for is there a Republican candidate against Angus King in Maine\nThere is but ah and he's a good guy but unfortunately Angus King has this impenetrable independent damage because he technically runs as an independent so he's got that nailed down\nOkay except I understood the New York times today random forming piece about the Democrat there's a democratic nominee against Angus King whose name is Zak Ringelstein and he apparently is a big Bernie Sanders guy he's been endorsed by democratic socialists\nIf we should encourage if anybody listening to us up in Maine vote your conscience vote for the real socialist votes or ringelstein the Democrats\nAnd make ... right there has to be at least forty percent something like that all votes the Republican anyway right\n[noise] well you know all all I'll say is that when you're trying to remember who to vote for king does beat wrinkles time\n[laughter] at the ... yes in in terms of the future but I I assume that the Republican candidate they could do more than ringelstein as well as any other surprises that you think we should look out for on election day\nBut then you ask people what about your own congressman congressman Smith I happen to have a congressman Smith whose ... are representing my district as as it happens so what about ... and they say oh my congressman he's the exception he's really a good guy\nIt says the normal way people feel and they talk about public schools are are medical care anything else is that I'm the only one who's fortunate [laughter] in an island of dysfunction of loyalty and this summer is probably\nCouldn't keep her house it may be in part because at the last minute people who are really mad at Donald Trump will say yeah but I'm I'm really so mad at him that I Want to get rid of the guy that I've liked her met or shaking his hand or helped me out\nAnd that's why in general you never bet against incumbents for some of these Republican incumbents me in the end when because they've built up goodwill over the years\nTo the real problem is the forty empty seats right there were forty republic as ... or more\nEmpty seats in decades and that for that I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because at an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party street party line\nSo I'm\nIn in terms of I Know that the Republicans have a good chance of knocking off some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook Political Report\nTo win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks in the campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\n[noise] well I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nFrankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that's number one\nTo the economy is really good and that's not an accident or bronco Palmer back Obama's policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards wrote for the Democrats the takeover Congress and the third is\nYou know uh there's some basic things that Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law\nAs proven by Kavanaugh and to why are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it that moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration this is outrageous that we have for these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election\nAnd at the same time the Democrats are completely silent but a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen\nA which the wall Street Journal is written about and the Daily Beast has written about that this really started or as as basically a means of undermining the currents center right president of Honduras\nAnd to hold the American people hostage to the vagaries of hunger door and dirty tricks campaigning\nDoesn't seem a good idea Jon or of\nDemocrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and I hear cricket fire crickets\nWell exactly what I have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the the the family separation issue which they tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic adds a feature health care isn't that a mistake don't you think\nWell it's putting lots of eggs in one basket and you know I think preexisting conditions are important I don't think they're that important to that many Americans\nOkay and Republicans have been very emphatic that we are not going to endanger people with preexisting conditions at those guarantees will remain a we are speaking with John Fund John
