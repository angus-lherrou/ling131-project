the whole world\nPeople lose their mind because you have just\nSpoken a powerful truth that everyone says you must not take sides you must not and so he is the focus I mean most people who like him understand this but I think a lot of people on the fence trying to figure them out [noise] and I really thought first of all with all this hour notice in our time the bitter sour left to you know\nA ... banging on the Supreme Court door and shrieking like devil's and and behaving like children this madness first of all we need to\nHave some humor and to celebrate what is good warriors remember

Donald uh and so they go to Donald Donald can you help us\nAre they telling us that the situation he says well tomorrow you know I've got some time I'll go down to the swamp and see what's going on so he takes a walk down to the swamp encounters a first swamp creature\nA lobbyist tourists and the lobbyists or says ... you don't understand you can't talk to the king the king doesn't talk to people who live outside the swamp he only does live inside and so I'm so if you want to live in the swamp maybe work something out down says not interested I'll see you later so he goes back and tells\nThe cave people he says listen it's worse than we thought wouldn't have to get drastic and he said they say what do you mean drastic he use as we are going to have to drain the swamp and they kind of gets can't like you can't say that don't that don't say that the\nHe says no no no the only way and if you will how you gonna do you're gonna get a swamp people angry and he goes well you're angry aren't you and they say yes\nAnd just well maybe it's an air turned so the next day he decides I'm going to dig a trench he's a builder he knows how to do this kind of all this time and I walked to try and

the swamp the people who live outside the swamp\nAre uneducated they're on cultured they're deplorable any understands that you know what only needs to do is dig the trench and ignore these creatures so he starts to dig the trench and as he's taking the trench he sees that the swamp green color the swamp is actually the color of money why\nBecause the whole swamp is money that's why the swamp creatures will not leave the swamp so he starts digging and then the biggest battle swamp creature ball shows up and he's angry the biggest bad a swamp creature ball is called\nThe George Soros\nAnd the Georgia sources really angry he has bags under his other than the he looks Hungarian and he looks like a billionaire but but the Georgia storage is really angry but Donald turns around and\nAll of the cave people showing up with shovels and they say well not as angry as we are and they help him dig the trench dig the trench drain the swamp drained it was one of the rest of the book but want to

very much worth our attention is the fourth coming midterm elections we're we elect all for him to thirty five members\nOf the house of representatives and I believe we're electing thirty five new U.S senators because there are a couple of special elections there in the mix\nAnd uh how's it going to go well it's a toss up and it's close but\nThere is some very very sound advice it seems to me that is given to Democrats by a leading Republican and somebody who is one of his own house elections by huge margins one two terms also by huge margins as the governor of Louisiana\nHis name is Bobby Jindal and he wrote a terrific piece that appeared in the wall Street Journal under the headline Democrats try some self restraint governor Jindal thanks very much for joining us again are always great to talk to\nMy Oh thank you so much for having me back on your show it's always great to talk to you and your audience as well\nI appreciate it one eight hundred nine five ... Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\n... ... you say make so much sense in other words just to give people a flavor what you're saying you were Democrats Democrats you write can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate their religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nThey can defend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on midterm abortions they can fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods in lifestyle\nIf all of that is possible why do you think the Democratic party seems to be moving in the other direction\nOr Michael I think this is really an important moment for the Democratic party and they have to decide are they going to listen to the most extreme base or are they going to try to become and remain a mainstream political party in the United states\nNow look I ... I lift those and other policy positions that they're certainly not going to appeal to conservative Republicans like me and I suspect many of your listeners\nI think by by trying to come to the middle of the Democratic party can actually recapture some of those voters who voted for Trump who weren't consistent traditional Republican voters or they can make the decision they want to become an angrier and even more radicalized\nAnd they look they really have a choice if they pursue things like trying to impeach president proper trying to teach Brett Kavanaugh they insist on open borders they insist on abolishing ice or Medicare for all\nThose are great talking points on that excites their base and that can write a lot of money from George Soros and folks like that\nBut I don't think they're going to win a lot of elections I think that if anything there to help the President Trump wins reelection I think the worst thing they can do is to continue to go to the far left but I think they've got a choice to make do they want to come back to the middle or they want to continue to be the angry far left party\nOkay ... one of the things and I heard this a a theory from a friend of mine is a long time activist in in Republican affair she has a theory is that what the Democrats are trying to do is to go so far to the less\nThan a there has to be set up a middle party somewhere that would run some kind of quote bipartisan tickets and uh they feel that that that kind of middle party with a celebrity taking the middle would take enough votes away from President Trump\nTo ah to to give Democrats victories in\nThousand twenty what do you think\nI I think that if they decide if that's their plan President Trump\nCan start measuring the drapes already at me and my plan on being an office for another six years the reality is that there's at least thirty five forty percent of voters they're going to stick with President Trump to matter what he's shown that time and time again he had those voters in the primary against running against several Republican candidates he had those voters\nOr through his highs and lows with campaign against Hillary Clinton any that voters\nDrives entire two years the reality is look the Democratic party should stop focusing obsessing with President Trump of the Republican Party they should come up with a real solutions to the problems that are\nConcerning the American people if they continue to go to extremes you know the problem that the Democratic party has right now is that they're trying they're trying to persuade anybody they're simply trying to fight and motivate the most liberal members of their base\nAnd they practically given up on the middle class but working class voters\nThat so famously went for President Trump now these are not always reliable Republican voters Republican Party cannot get complacent we don't only voters they're not going to be loyal voters but they will vote for President Trump and they will vote for Republican officeholders as long as they continue to deliver so as long as\nYou got to cut taxes and cut regulations have done what he promised the move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem he's standing\nWith Israel and the international stage he's defending their Second Amendment rights is defending the religious liberty right these pointing conservative judges\nSo you know these are the voters that will go and fall would vote for leaders that are actually going to do what they promised they were gonna do President Trump has done that if the Democratic party really wants to win back the blue collar voters many of them are union voters and many of them living in the heartland in between those two cos if they really want to get back to those voters\nThey've got to stop the the crazy rhetoric they've got to stop the extreme policies I'm not optimistic they'll do that but I I wanted to leave lay out the choice that the party faces\nYou can already see the Democratic candidates they're gearing up to run for president twenty twenty they're already trying to run that they're competing to see who can go further to the left and their policy position of becoming even more radical but one simple example you listed as a few examples\nThey can be per multiculturalism that doesn't mean they have to reject faith or traditional values from the public square\nPatriotism for that matter ... right\nThat they've almost made into a ... for some reason the Democratic party thinks that's a winning issue to put down the American flag or or put down patriotism or are being proud of being an American and I just don't think that's a winning formula to be being a majority party in this country\nBy the way that's one of the reasons I think is so important that Ted Cruz wins this race in Texas because ... is really bad the entire farm on his support of a kneeling during the national anthem for pro football players\nAnd again this whole idea that we can have American as a nation or I mean you're you're a child of immigrants uh my mother was an immigrant to this country\nAnd uh one of the things that's great about most immigrant families is patriotism love of country loving America\nBut the Democrats by running against that\nI'm not ... it's it's a disaster let me give you a challenge governor Jindal which is that\nA ... you write a balance the Democratic party I Know a lot of our critics there are a lot of people on the left to say it's even more true about the Republican Party they've gone so far to the right they lost the mental they've given up on the middle or what do you say to people like that\nWell look I think a couple of days I think both parties are absolutely guilty of thinking they're permanent majorities and I hate us in the column and the reality of the voter always have to remind them unfortunately if you think about the middle east everybody remembers\nWho hurt them yesterday and and they would they want to get their avenge tomorrow and in both parties are certainly guilty of that but just look at the Kavanaugh hearings as a great counter example look\nBrett Kavanaugh was not the most conservative justice that the president could have nominated he he's a fairly moderate establishment figure a Republican now I Am not a moderate ... between the two parties\n... graduate yell undergraduate or graduate you know he went to a very good schools worked in the Bush administration\nAnd even before the allegations came out against him he looked at the Democratic history on existing extreme reaction\nAnd I think what you see it as easy to the extreme overreaction from the left I Would argue that look certainly there are folks in both parties but that go to extremes\nBut I think when you look at what the president is actually done in terms of cutting taxes cutting regulation to in terms of the growth we're seeing the American economy\nThis is what a majority of the American people want it you know the the reason he won the election and this is a very important point he didn't say one thing get elected and then do something else everything that drives the Democrats crazy about President Trump he absolutely promised on the election trail he was going to do these things\nAnd that's why he won the reality of it is not that voters or or you know the fact that Trump voters are disappointed in him or what he's done they're actually getting what he promised them on the campaign trail so\nBut I I think the Democratic party has got a fundamental choice I think part of the problem is that when you look at the activist base you look at the donor base\nThey will punish Democrats that want to compromise you know look at the Democratic party to already made up their minds when Kavanaugh before the hearing started they tore person on that committee almost every one of the months ago came out and said they were going to oppose them\nAnd I think they're trying to appeal to the liberal donors most liberal activist\nWhat they forget that was that's not where most American voters are most American voters don't want to abolish ice most American voter\nDon't think that the police are across the board you know out there trying to hurt innocent people most American voters want to stand for the ... the American flag and most American voters are to your point patriots I'm reminded when asked President Obama about you know he did he think America was accept Sean and remember that Canada wishy washy answer\nA comedian\nOr he is the host of the Tosh point oh\nWhich actually has twenty six million Twitter followers that's a lot in any event or he responded to Taylor Swift saying get out and they'll get a vote she said I'm encouraging all my
