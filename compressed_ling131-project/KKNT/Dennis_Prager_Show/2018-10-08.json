kept us\nBut we all knew all the details all the ... details by the way up their relationship and how she killed him and all of that at the very same time that trial was on ... was on trial for killing babies who were born in life and ... and crickets\nAbsolute crickets so I think there'll be a lot of people asking questions about how complicit the media were in the cover up a cover up of the story how it was for example and you know so many people have gotten away with murder here at the department of health in Harrisburg by the way to indict\nTo him and died in a clinical trial to an

issue in his\nColumn that he writes liberals this is war and by the way the next day or actually it was the prior day the liberals this this war that this morning\nOn Saturday the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy crisis is by Michael ... and he makes an interesting point which is that for justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh\nThey are the only two justices in the entire history of the Supreme Court\nWho have been nominated by president who didn't win the popular vote and confirmed by a majority of center senators\nWho when you take all the votes that the people who voted for Gorsuch and all the votes of the people who voted for\nJustice Kevin Hall and you put them against all of those gathered by the people who voted against them well there were more votes for the people who voted against cheap but this is craziness because that's not how the way we choose US Senators\nIt's true that that Wyoming gets to the U.S senators there too fine conservative Republicans so to California\nAnd Wyoming has a population of about six hundred thousand in California has a population of thirty eight million they have the same representation in the U.S Senate that's how you find them more votes on the other side but do it this deliberately is the way they set up the constitution to protect smaller states\nSo that you don't have a situation where everything in the whole country is irrelevant except for California and Texas and Florida and New York everything else doesn't count I I mean this is very obvious\nAnd yes people who vote in California you get to be counted in the popular vote and they certainly have a big say in the electoral votes because you've got fifty five electoral votes in but here's here's the basic point\nHis complained is not against the legitimacy of the court\nHis complaint is against the constitutional system that does work\nPretty well for two hundred and forty years\nReally what's wrong with these people you're going to challenge the legitimate me the court not based upon the qualifications of justice Gorsuch or justice Kavanaugh\nBut based on the fact that the senators who voted for the most of whom are Republicans represented states with smaller population than the people who voted against them one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six ... really it's foolishness\nA deep deep foolishness it seems to me and speaking of deep foolishness one of the um\nMost outspoken opponents of the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh was far that gets uh the one\nAnd only course Booker and he was out campaigning

Iowa because that's where the Democratic nomination process begins\nAnd his plan to win the presidency as he is going to be the most hysterical\nOr the most over the top the most ridiculous of all of the Democrats speaking now a lot of people said he's trying to follow the path blazed by Brock Obama who won the Iowa caucuses that was the beginning of his path to the presidency beat Hillary Clinton the Iowa caucus\nIs very different bronco Obama went to Iowa trying to show he was more reasonable more unified\nAnd I'm Cory Booker well Cory Booker\nGoes to Iowa and sounds like this\nLong until

and Dr Montgomery and a man named king the speech to those people who are tempted to surrender to cynicism in that time\nIs pathetic and by the way there's this a judge Kavanaugh just made some history\nHe uh announced the for law clerks that is he is higher now the idea of a law clerk a law clerk does much of the work force Supreme Court justice the research\nOften draft of the writing there have been a justices who do all their own writing but most allow the clerks to do some drafts\nAnd clerks end up having an enormous impact on a justices service for the first time ever before
