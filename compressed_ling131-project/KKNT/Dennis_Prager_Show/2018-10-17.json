could do you know I'm not for family members argument with one another by one family first in this regard however\nQuestions for clarification so I Would like you to ask a real liberal relative not just left liberal\nThat just came out from the United nations that when the ... you say the United nations they immediately believe it's true the United nations report just released reveals that over forty percent of births in the United states are too on married\nWomen in Nineteen Seventy it was ten percent does this disturb you that's it\nDoes this disturb you it's like my question to atheist I don't ask them I don't I mean if if I'm invited to the debate debate that my debated atheists pool in my life but I mean I just have a question to ask if I meet an atheist and you know at a social occasion\nDo you hope you're right or wrong\nThat's my only question I don't have I don't want to debate them at a\nAt a dinner party so this is a question to ask them do you do do you think it is a

message or even my message is the consequences of secularism secular government is great secular society is chaos\nThat's the that's the way it is if you have a different explanation for forty percent

I think exploring how important is a honeymoon\nI can see a very good argument for right after the marriage\nJumping into a normal life I can also see a great argument for getting away from everybody and just having time for the two I I I'm not an advocate here about having a honeymoon I'm not an advocate for having one I think that there are good arguments for for both\nOr or delaying you know for six months or something if some people do because they just can't get away if that time but I I don't know the answer I don't know if the honeymoon has been\nA a generally positive force in bomb being people or irrelevant or even counterproductive I don't I don't have an answer to that\nIt would be interesting study to engage in however but that's not really the question it's it may be the upshot of the hour but it's not the question of the the question of the hour is\nHow much related uh is was your honeymoon as if to the rest of your marriage was it a good predictor all righty\nLet's go to our best in Philadelphia Hi Beth thank you for calling\nTo talk to you good\nHealth and well actually the summer for the first time after celebrate ... years [noise]\nAnd the second time around what Chuck amazing it's the first time but one one funny thing from our bureau how clever\nTogether prior to our honeymoon we definitely need\nA little little habits like for example ah you know I really like my sleep and like and you know he'd be waiting and waiting for me to start our days activities that you know I didn't really get away from\nEveryday life had to learn a little bit about each other\nIn ways that we hadn't\nSo you know I Am for from what you said you were not living together prior to marriage\nFor religious reasons yeah [noise]\nSo that you you have just given me another topic for a male female our\nBecause I Wonder if the honeymoon is not more exciting if you didn't live together\nI mean how could it not be [laughter]\nI mean that was definitely the anticipation for the wedding night for sure [laughter]\nI like you are as your husband is happy as you are\nIncredible man that I Know\nWow you are\n[laughter] ... that is in hot or I Would love to meet the two of you I I really my next time you you got to come to a speech but my next time in Philadelphia\nOkay All right\nThank you God I ...
