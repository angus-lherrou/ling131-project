Khan who is a liberation and access officer what does that mean what does the liberation of access officer author demotion and called the making Senate more accessible\n... said that using a jazz hands instead of traditional clapping would also optimally be a part of inclusion training\n\nNational union of students women's campaign announced the band at their twenty Fifteen conference after some people complained that the clapping noise was triggering them\n\nOne Twitter user wrote an op ed in us women ... and if students women women cam please can we ask people to stop clapping\nBought to do a feminist jazz hands it's triggering some people's anxiety thank you that's right I mean are you realize\nI Wonder if they will start seeing about talk radio it triggers anxiety we should use sign language on the radio show\n\nYeah no no of course you've got to do away with the applause sound effects no jazz has an effect\nThis is the problem this is the problem is I I've been saying since I began broadcasting thirty five years ago\nWhen you have massive a massively successful society successful meaning freedom and affluence and people have no\nFrom basis no try and certainly no transcendent basis for their values they make up things and they destroy their own society\nThat is the left the ... of the left\nMagic that clapping causes anxiety if clapping causes anxiety what you do is you tell the person the person who becomes anxious you have to work on that\nI've known someone who had such anxieties not with clapping but with large groups of people you don't stop large groups of people from meeting you teach the person how to do it\nNo you're allowed to shout down Republicans in restaurants that it it is it your here's the point you're supposed to induce anxiety in

being a communist [laughter] and you angry\nResponded and said you're not you don't have the temperament to have the job and it's just a job interview going fired for being a professor after forty years [laughter] and what's the difference if you're innocent or guilty somebody and said you're a communist is going to be back to the inquisition when they would call you in first\nAnd make you testify and then they present the evidence look once you're accused the most heinous crime imaginable it turns into a trial where you have due process\nWhere the burden of proof is on the other side where the evidence has to be clear and convincing in America we don't allow people to destroy other people's reputations in careers based\nOn prince of guilt the way the ACLU now says he says we

state\nThat is something nobody thinks about unless they listen to the happiness our with me and I was not bragging or any nonsense like that I have zero interest in bragging ... [laughter]\nI just am interested in telling you the sad truth ... you're not going to hear that outside of this show or my book on happiness that happiness is a moral virtue\nYou know who knew what the founders knew what life liberty and the pursuit of happiness pursuit of happiness is a good thing pursuit of fun is not a good thing to\nGet it or we are born here\nToday's topic on a one to ten scale of importance is drum roll play is [noise]\nNine point for four or six new line for three to\nFive\nThat is how important it is by friends we are very precise on this program now you're some the to a gentleman that I work with the living martyr and a triple ...\nAre thinking why does that bring come up with stuff like that is that correct [noise] yes all very good yeah you know what that dates you you're very young how do you know if there were slide rules or your father had a slide\nRule I Am living martyr how many uh guys under or girls under thirty know what a slide rule does\nCoast is it that's so interesting how about what else will always that thing we use where you had the pin on one side and the and the pencil on the other we made a circle\n\nWhat was the ... pro tractor all I have not use that word\nSince ... before Reagan I Know I pro tractor I Would if you said you will not eat until you come up with that word I starve to death pro tractor [laughter]\nDo they use that you don't like I was with a bunch of kids the other day kids or college kids and I asked them how many of you can read and write cursive\n... remember though this was a Colorado Christian a university so I think that I got a disproportionately high number who said yeah I couldn't read person then I said okay how do you write a capital by\n[laughter] and\nI get a very positive response today's subject is indeed be extremely important that this could change your life I'm like I'm not kidding\n\nVery very very very few people\nHave it good in every area of life\nI ... I mean every important area flex let me give you a list or write a list of\nAnd if I miss them eight I Would ask the two gentlemen with who I work to come up with something I missed All right now and by the way this is not an order of importance it solely in the order of their appearance in my brain actually in my in my mind so for example health\nChildren parents spouse in other words marriage work\nRight how many people can say that in all of those areas of life they have been the recipient of great\nHappiness the answer is very few\nI was with somebody who has a spectacular life spectacular children in great health\nAnd a fair marriage a fair marriage not a bad marriage at all not a particularly good marriage\nAnd this person I couldn't even say male or female this person or did I say great career as well do I mentioned that I don't think so children career health\nTerrific marriage fair\nAnd the answer is with the person like a better marriage absolutely is the person basically happy you absolutely\nBecause you have to find happiness where you can that's the lesson of today's happy with sour and very few people find it in all major arenas\n\nAll right that's that's you you don't like your job okay you have a good marriage All right so be happy\n\nTo be the ability to have\nHappiness supplied as it were by\nEvery major avenue\nIs a rare warm for most people want a prayer seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six is the number if you take this seriously you can have a happier life\nIt just it just doesn't work out for everybody\nEvery major area happiness producer so your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work on being happy\nAm I to me that's more amazing that people not working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's analogous\n\nYou know if people did X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it\nBecause I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for very few people does life deliver in all arenas\nOf life that's that's key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't good so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about and ... not worthy of divorce\nUnderstands that there are other avenues oh what's skews me I Can't believe it I Can't believe I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've the punishment room is only earned for carelessness not for content but I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content should should apply anyway friends\nHow am I forget that one\nSo friends health marriage I said parents I ah I Know of course children I Know but I I'm thinking I just don't include parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life and it's all put parents and\nSo parents children friend's health work marriage there you go\nIf you got 'em on all cylinders that I mean that's like having an all wheel drive\nAnd be and I was thinking of a brand name but I don't want to push any particular brand name here but you know what I mean I mean in all wheel drive super luxury s._u._v.\n\nAlright that's it's not it most people can't afford it or just don't want any Prager seven seven six\nFind happiness where you can okay that's the point instead of concentrating on where you don't have it All right everybody and

my call on my question to you and and um [noise]\nAnd then married and trying to improve the areas of your life that you don't that don't bring you happiness as opposed to the status quo and and you sort of credit and looking for happiness\nBut it's a wonderful question I my my my answer would be that what you do both you you uh [noise] you can't in other words you can't wait until that success\nFor you to be happy you can say oh when I fix this I'll be happy you have to be happy wall fixing so I Want you to fix if you can\nIf one of those areas or two or three of those areas are or not sources of happiness I Would love you to pursue those areas but you can't the for being happy until those those successfully\nAccomplished so that makes sense\nThat there are a very good answer I

On my show every every day\nI mean now it's a yeah OK mackerel that okay it's a very important and difficult question because I I really do have to open up to you I of all most listeners of a long

not grow up a happy child I became happy in high school but before that I I was not happy so in fact if I didn't have all of the pain that I've had I don't think I could do happiness so in ... the question has merit\nI think if you if you have everything that I listed with no glitches\nAnd I think about ten percent of the population does one out of ten people I think ... might well I don't

I knew the word obligations throughout throughout my life oh by the way to give you a real power for example the uh Judaism and Christianity believe that that husband and wife have sexual obligations to the to their spouse\nYou see that today you're accused of advocating marital rape Huffington Post just accused me of marital rape second time I've been accused at least I Know of I'm sure doesn't know about that is dozen times but I mean the big places because I wrote an article ten years ago\nAnd we're trying proud of and people should read it\nSaying that given the ... the importance of sex to a marriage if you love your husband\nAnd he loves you and he's a good man don't let mood alone determine whether you will have sex with him sometimes just have it because you love him that's called marital rape today\nThat I Believe that there are obligations I have obligations to my wife ... in in a whole host the barriers and she has obligations to me in a whole host of area\nThe other difference between a religious education and the secular education I was taught that the greatest problem in Dennis ... life\nIs Dennis prayer that is a religious school Christian school Jewish school the biggest issue when your life is you know\nSecular school biggest issue in life is American society sexism racism Z to phobia homophobia et cetera big difference say so those are my areas for Matty good luck\nWouldn't it be fun if I showed up just flew to Houston and showed up\nI just you have no idea that there was a part of me that would love to do that [laughter] I don't know if the rabbi would be happy [laughter]\nUh ... the lead to see\nA Andrew in Fort Worth high\nOf almost ... very well thank you\nFor the quick for you and would you rather be your only respected and why\nIt depends by whom\nGotcha has helped\nMe by fear that when I go and like I fear consequences for um ... my parents or my spouse\nI rather that America be feared than anything else so it if there were times where respected I think that uh I think if my children had no fear of me it wouldn't have been good\nThat but today at their ages in their twenties and thirties I don't I don't want them to fear me I don't I don't think that's that would be a good thing\nI Want them to respect me and love me but uh when they're when they're eight I Would like them to fear me you'll like this Andrew I asked if I did an hour once\nIf you didn't do drugs when you were in high school or college or say high school why not\nThe biggest the most common answer was because my mother would kill me\nThat's good grade we read or write\nYes sir thank you very much appreciate your call\nGot a lot of young ... on the on the on this hour and on the male female and I'm a happy it's very interesting I have a theory on that book only but for them\nBut I remember I said I Would like America feared yeah I Do when America's feared there's more peace on earth\nIf you like a piece you want America feared if you are like war then you don't want America feared you just want America like any other nation\nThat's why I said if the Nobel Peace prize we're really\nAwarded to those who deserve it\nThe American armed forces would get the Nobel Peace prize the greatest force for peace on earth is American might OK okay\nNow why do I have a feeling that the current president would agree with that and the previous president would not\nWell because I my my assumption is Adam was made as a man so therefore God can make things that knew that are already old\nLike yes you can call ... ... can do anything so why did your jaw drop\nWell because I think that if you like the gentleman that called me for me was saying that if the if you look at the history of how you know genesis you argue that\nThere are no no it's not the issue of the age of the earth is not based on genesis genealogy it's based on believing up to six days of creation or six twenty four hour days Adam is and create it till the end of the six day\nThat's a allergies begin so you can only believe that the earth\nIs a few thousand years old if you take literally\nThat each of the creation days is twenty four hours but the sun is not created for days how can you have a day without the sun also the word Yom in Hebrew\nWhich has that worked for a day is used in so many context for example genesis to five it says this is the creation of the world in the day that God created the heavens in the earth\nSo clearly doesn't mean one day also got calls light day and dark night\nSo God himself uses the term Yom in in a different way than the twenty four hour a day so there's there's just no I'll listen I don't have an argument we said that to the earlier caller I Believe it's billions of years old but if somebody says it's a few thousand years old they they don't bother me\nThey they don't hurt the society for that belief they still give their kids to a polio shots\nAnd measles shots\nTheyre not anti science\nSo uh that's that's I I don't it's not an argument is that I feel is critical I Believe I Believe that the first five books or indeed divide and the God is in the rest of the Bible\nBut I don't believe that it is it is a a battle worth fighting over the literal ... of the days of the six days of creation\nAnd a high title my work on the Bible the rational Bible and I try to be true to the title reason tells me that it's billions of years old\nIt is not one ... less a miracle if God created the universe in six days or in six billion years what what is the difference\nAnd by the way the Bible of self says in ... a day in God's ... a day in God's eyes just like three thousand is like a thousand years\nOkay thank you my friend and I really appreciate it mean to win semi Valley California you're the first man go I

I ... you talk about the presumption of innocence now again you're in a unique position talking about anything having to do with hash tag ... two were accusations about\nMistreatment of women because that's had a very big impact on your life in your career\nOr do you think we may be reaching a turning point in this whole narrative that says that anyone who makes any accusations had all\nShould be a ... instinctively supported do you think that is likely to begin to change\nYeah I'm constraint or what I can say because uh I have to leave the legal action in play to restore my reputation and of course it takes\nA lot of money and a lot of time to do that so I Can't really get into my situation I can tell you the same people who are now paying demonstrators to disrupt the capital or will behind um my accusations and they paid people to stand out for a Fox News with pot savings people\nRight same groups and it's outrageous it's an outrage the problem with the accusation industry and that's what it is now Michael can industry All right and it's run by two four six\n... lawyers who are shakedown auditors to know that they can uh get money from individuals and corporations just by the obligation because the corporations and individuals on a public\nA shakedown industry it's been in place now for decades but now you have the allegation industry used by political people All right so if we don't like cabinet or we can't defeat him on the merits\nIt was going to be confirmed so we're going to put out a a a letter from a woman who says well he he uh molested me when I was Fifteen Years old okay so that's what happened that's what happened that's what they did\nAnd of course the wild card in this was the press and the press is the driver primary driver of the political allegation industry because the press doesn't care what's true\nThey didn't know searching in my case at all none zero and we provided press outlets with the scope Atari evidence they didn't print it it wouldn't even use it I mean CNN and use the word rape in conjunction with a cabin on more than a hundred times\nMore than a hundred times CNN are associated cabinet with rape\nAnd it did and then none of these accusers uh uh ... ever even alleged that he raped anyone did they\nKnow a while one day one did a ... that that\n... and they said this is sweating and said she saw he participated in a drug gang spiking punch and things that\nGirls could be right by a line of boys\nRight and which line much at in the\nBeginning the cabin always in the line\nAnd then she hold back on that\nOne out what I'm trying to get across is and this is very important for people to understand is that the corrupt American media and it is as corrupted has ever been in our republic doesn't care what happened they want the salacious headline alright they want to tag powerful people with this\nOkay let me just interrupt you for a moment and a rather momentous announcement Joe mansion just about yes\nHe will vote yes on Kavanaugh which means that he is a sure now of fifty one votes he will be confirmed he needs fifty go ahead\n[noise] mansion in you know if it wants Collins came across mansion and had nothing to lose\nSo I'm not either I'd like Collins was sincere and somewhat brave but mansion I mentioned I liked your eye on 'em but he just waited back and say oh well now it's a sure thing so I'll say yes\nBecause there's you know if it's a pie in the Senate the vice president breaks the tie in a cabin was favor for a measure that putting any currency on the line now because Schumer the Senate minority leader threatened to all the Democratic senators by saying if you support cabinet will cut off all your money\nSo when you run for reelection not getting any money from the national committee\nSchumer did\nDon't you think this is gonna Heidi Heitkamp was already running I think nine or ten points behind a in her race a North Dakota I held him\nBack and and she'll lose in North Dakota\nYeah but but again it's hard to understand\nWhy you see this this was a point when you listen to senator Collins\nShe brought out the point that that look up a Brett Kavanaugh is not some extreme legal theorist he's respected judge he's right in the Republican mainstream\nHe's about as a moderate and appointee as they could possibly hope for from Donald Trump so what's what is behind this this hysterical this is what\nDemocracy looks like no no ... got to do\nThe demonstrators and the craziness that they're not all rented demonstrators Amy Schumer got herself arrested ... what does she have in this fight\nAbortion what it is the aggressive left knows that the states many of the Mississippi is the latest and Missouri is in there as well are trying to limit\nA timeframe on abortion abortion clinic access things like that\nSo many of those cases will go to the Supreme Court and a Kavanaugh will most likely come down on the side that the states have a right to regulate commerce which is what abortions come down to now Planned Parenthood\nA they have a constitutional right to regulate Khan a commerce within their borders\nSo the far left the progressive should control the Democratic party and the media basically say we can't have this guy\nBecause he's going to come down on the side of the states to limit abortion\nWe want unfettered abortion abortion under any reason under any circumstances at any time that's what we want that's what they mean Schumer watch which would Hillary Clinton more and that's what that's why the um Kavanaugh\nThat they're the political component in the whole Ford hierarchy the whole crew was designed to get Kavanaugh at all the people in the crew were Kavanaugh haters and that's about if you were aggrieved American\nAnd you didn't mistreated you don't go out and hire an ideological lawyer you hire the best forensic lawyer you can fire that's what you do\nSo it was too much money and it's too much political shenanigans going on for me to be optimistic that we'll ever have a fair process of a confirming anyone in this country at least in the short\nTerm don't you suspect that and by the way I Do think that it's more likely than not that President Trump is going to get in his first term and and that's even assuming that he gets his second term but in his first term he could very well get another Supreme Court appointment\nWhich way I was already on our last word [laughter] you know what I'm saying that way she's such a you know I I mean she's eighty five years now she's eighty five\nEighty five ... she's an eye on a burner is a why he's seven a year or two\nYeah he's he's yes I think he may be Seventy nine he's yeah they're they're both\nThe liberal lion and as you said I mean they're going to happen at any time so but the court now is uh where Trump wants a debate ... even if you are Republicans who voted for him you don't like them you know like a style you don't like it handled himself now um the court is a traditional court again\nBut if if he if Trump and let's say that Justice Ginsburg resigns and President Trump a points Amy Coney Barrett who apparently was the runner up\nTo ... on an island and then she will be the next nominee Trump catch it yeah and and it would be the one and and don't you think they will try to attack her as a quote Catholic fanatic seven children and of course I Do\nKnow they'll try to paint her as an Amish person [laughter] are not not not that there's anything wrong with ... you know I mean in the extremists are never going to have not seen Nashville lifestyle I live\nUm you know a show at\n... just back to this Media Analysis which you've just been putting forward\nDon't you think there should be room for the same way that Roger ales or started Fox News recognizing there was room in the market that there needed to be a conservative voice uh don't you think there should be room for something more up to the middle than what we got right now\nSure ah and I think that you could make money doing it [laughter] but it's not easy and it requires a tremendous investment\nUm people come with me all the time I go and say
