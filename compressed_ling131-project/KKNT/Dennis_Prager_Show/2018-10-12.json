recalcitrant are hesitant\nYou have to do what you have to do\nSo uh you you you make you make periodic calls or you send an email just checking in if they don't want to respond they didn't you we have to do the right thing and again this is this is my single biggest example of why I Believe people need religion\nPeople turn me to be told on or your father and your mother because of God wasn't

we're lucky or their parents didn't want to press charges [laughter]\nThe older books or where it says God said the traditional drew believe Scott said so God said to ... than the traditional drew believe Scott said the ... but if you have a ... for example\nA fish will this will be the authors or you know in that case king David uh usually and that is or you know proverbs biking Solomon traditionally\nA but not ... not the word of God there that could be inspired but it's not the same as the first five books\nI think by the way I see that Jesus would have looked at it that way to adjust to it so speaking to you as a Christian I Jesus being a very traditional Jew would have said the same thing I Am he would have recorded the Torah\nAs uniquely a significant\nI certainly will ponder that I I don't know that I I agree with that but I\nCertainly don't know exactly the way the issue is not even agreement the issue is us out as the juicy it you know ... on on matters of face\nOr you know I always said if I don't I don't expect agreement and it's not even a significant to me so so so there's different ... but the ... it's the values that's why we speak of Judeo Christian values about Judeo Christian theology\nI agree but I guess is the book of Isaiah for example divinely inspired\nNo where God Speaks to why you say it is just as much guard as God Speaking in the Torah\nBut but where you have other statements that it doesn't say and God said so then it's as I said like proverbs ... that is not from God\nOkay well that's a that's a hell for clarification of a difference is that I I understand that\nGood God Bless you and I mean it thank you so much Cokie and Kevin in North Hollywood, California high\n[noise] yes yes Hi Beth I have a question for you

here's the ultimate question a lot of my ... my followers which I'm not as many as years obviously I'm half so so\nYou do say hey you know we absolutely have to go against is left is a mob of you know

this country right now on the directions that we should go there are a lot of books that come over my desk\nThere is one book in particular that it just is a must read at this moment\nBecause it is so relevant to people who were concerned amount\nThe prospect of Maine new democratic move for impeachment impeachment Brett Kavanaugh impeachment of President Trump\nFor if you're concerned about what's happening with the Mueller investigation or if you're concerned about the Brett\nKavanaugh's confirmation is extremely relevant material on all of that in contempt\nIs subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation the author is Ken Starr and a jet star I've I've got to tell you this book is so reasonable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are most sensational unsatisfying\nAnd uh the the book is posted at our website at Michael med dot com in writing it and then the response to the book which has been overwhelming sense has come out what surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that the Clinton a spin machine has remained silent and I say I say and and I don't really meant to be unkind but to the\nOther content spin cycle is Howard Kurtz that of the Washington Post style but uh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and somewhat say highly effective\nAt a taking issue with what seemed to me to be indisputable and that is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes from the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned to impeachment\nThat's a very high on the list because as you though a impeachment was extraordinarily controversial in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeachment now with some of the most of the center for his voice is saying how dare you\nA new book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off are so very well in your book\n[noise] yes and ah it'll turn the other cheek and kindness or to others and so forth but it's just the facts and and then and the facts are are\nAh and sort of the day new mall was when we and the investigation seriously consider presenting an indictment or to the federal grand jury and little walk\nNaming Hillary Rodham Clinton alone for her crimes in connection with the Little Rock or Arkansas phase of the investigation in addition a during the course of interviews with her at the White House she stood in such\nContrast in terms of sort of relational skills and the like\nWith her spouse Bill Clinton who of course is immensely charming and charismatic and empathy and all the rest of it and she said as I say in the book seemed to be just sort of deliberately in your face a A R massive\nA failure of recollection not only strain credulity Michael we chose to that by the time we assessed all of her answers we knew that she was she was lying under oath\nPainting a failure recollection that was so colossal so profound that it simply could not have been true\nOkay and you clearly believe a and I know because he said this elsewhere it it would be a mistake to pursue for Democrats\nOr to pursue impeachment proceedings against a either a justice Kavanaugh who used to work with you or against President Trump or why why would that be such a destructive course for the country and and that means you can relate that to some of the lessons in your book content\nYes Michael it goes back to the a structural protect shows a built in to the constitution\nTo prevent mob rule and we heard senator corner jury that Kavanaugh hearings so to speak about law school which seem to be the disorder of the day and that this Tokyo that we all experience to and we're starting to add\nThat the founding generation wanted a and demanded a super majority requirement and the Senate a simple majority of the house the people's house should put the issue into play\nAt their discretion so the majority can simply sent articles over but then there needs to be a bipartisan consensus\nDance the practical political message and the two thirds super majority requirements are is embodied in our constitution so don't go there there's just no reason there's no justification other than\nTo further divide the country if that's the goal let's just divide the country even even more let's do what the Russians\nWere paying ... amount of money and attention to to do and continue to do is just continue to sow discord\nA and rancor among the American people that would be the eventual a result and and I experience that and obviously we learn from our experiences\nAnd while I was not advocating peace when I was simply putting the facts of the Clinton investigation\nBefore the house of representatives and while I thought it was a perfectly reasonable action by the house of representatives\nWants the articles arrived at even before that it was very clear that the American people through the United States Senate was just they were not willing to go so far as to upset an election over these clearly establish climbs\nNow if clearly establish crimes such as perjury and obstruction of justice and the like\nAre not sufficient to remove an individual from office than there is absolutely nothing that we know that President Trump has done on leave injustice capital aside\nFor the for the moment that he has done that rises took a level as I see it if it if each ... so I think it's a the the book and it's on a way is a cautionary tale be careful before you marched down the road peach ...\nSpeaking with Ken Starr he is the author of contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nHe had been has pointed that special prosecutor and it was still special prosecutor net special counsel and he's one of the most distinguished attorneys and jurists and legal thinkers in our country\nHe um had been appointed to the federal court of appeals by President Reagan he was solicitor general under President George Herbert Walker Bush\nHe also served as president of Baylor University and as a dean of the Pepperdine University law school the book contempt is posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com\nYou were talking before about the need for bipartisan consensus in any I drive for impeachment of anybody is going to be successful\nAnd are there did appear to be some attempt by both two senators my I can name they were both Democrats at the time of the impeachment crisis I Know that a Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Dianne Feinstein a of um\nOf California I Believe had had both been involved with the idea of promoting censure or a resolution of censure and that could have passed the Congress don't you think\n[noise] yes I think a resolution of censure condemning the crowds of\nA crime a violation of basic principles increase out so the rule of law was passed overwhelmingly not unanimously but a overwhelmingly I think it would have exceeded a two thirds majority of cars are given a principled an elegant way out\nYeah and and I'm a white wine was ... who made the determination because it wasn't you who\nMade the determination not to accept a resolution of censure and then to go on with the people's business\nFor a number of arguments for advanced to the fact that the constitution contemplated impeachment and so it was either impeachment\nOr nothing and as I reflected on the constitutional issue I respectfully disagree with that and therefore would say that in the conversation that may uh unfold and twenty ninth team\nThat those who are crying impeachment of impeachment if their grounds for condemning and I'm saying if their breath and grounds for condemning the president but it's it's a foregone conclusion that impeachment will not succeed and the the the ... the United states will [noise]\nComplete his term of office will seek reelection et cetera et cetera\nThen a resolution of centuries strikes me is completely and the discretion of Congress there's nothing so let me turn the tables on the argument there is nothing in the constitution structurally or text Troy that forbid or prohibit or the Senate or the house\nAnd those who live in the law school yeah go ahead\nYeah yeah and this and to be there to the law school there and this is just I'm going to take more time and energy and so forth although I Will say this we were optimistic a that perhaps the um what was what became the Lewinsky phase the investigation will be over very promptly\nBecause we were going to be giving Monica\nThe opportunity to cooperate with the investigation and to see a complete immunity is as a witness get out of harm's way but of course famously and mostly as I describe the whole way sane at the Ritz Carlton hotel on that fateful\nDay and age thing uh in northern Virginia and the Pentagon city she said using very foul language to her mother who was encouraging her Monica to\nCooperate with the investigation and tech herself out of harm's way that she was not going to bring down this and she is very strong language ... uh and then she stay the course for five months and\nI'm the president for his part and sister that of course to the doctor told the truth is a perjury is a deposition and the Paula Jones case so the combination of the ... city\nOf Bill Clinton under oath and the stubborn refusal of Monica for five months to cooperate\nWith the investigation just hurt us and the nation through this very hellish purgatory old process\nSpeaking of a hellish in purgatory process\nI'm ... I I'm I'm sure you've encountered a the current special counsel Robert Mueller he's quiet right now for a while because it's just a few weeks before the upcoming election and I guess the tradition\nFor somebody in that position as you don't break any news right before an election or would you have some special advice for special counsel Robert Mueller about how to handle the conclusion and they didn't investigate ... based on your experience that you described in contempt\nYes I Would say that the regulations that are which she was appointed\nBy a Rod Rosenstein point the way to very happy resolution once she comes to a close friend and I think he has on me the wrong and I don't know but I think he has concluded that there was no collusion\nBetween the Trump campaign and Russian interests and that's why he was appointed obviously those the Paul Manafort matters the Rick Gates batter the indictments of the Russian individuals and organizations which really do touch on\nThe reason that he was appointed bring this to an orderly conclusion and a professional way as quickly as possible and then happily and this was a huge improvement Michael over the independent counsel statute of under which I was appointed and that is how the regulations which\nModel was appointed to not speak of impeachment\nWas a powerful dynamic in the independent counsel law Congress passed in Nineteen Seventy eight to nudge\nThe process toward impeachment\nThat's where we're going God willing or and you'll understand why that's so important when you read can can memoir of the Clinton investigation Ken Starr\nHas been a public servant all his life\nAnd I admire him briefly the book is also admirable we'll be right back\n\nNine sixty new\nWe Oreo con there are new report that plants are being made for a meeting between a tiny slice for finding on my part\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC that there is some movement toward a meeting at the G twenty somebody in Argentina late next month and China's says it's in contact with the United states and the two countries continue to face off over trade\nIn addition to the dispute over tariffs the Trump Administration accused Beijing last week of seeking to interfere in the upcoming us midterm elections rank lodged in Washington\nAnd additional lawsuit against the attorney general Jeff Sessions and the department of justice is expected to be filed by the city of Chicago today for denying funding for sanctuary cities assigned times reports that suit claims that that's how ... how to find this year based on new and what they call unlawful immigration enforcement requirements\nThat the first ... sessions last year after the D.
