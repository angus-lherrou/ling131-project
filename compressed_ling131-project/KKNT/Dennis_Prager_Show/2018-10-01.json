there and a few ... things that made me not you know these things are so serious that anybody could have made that kind of mistake then it looks like you're looking for lots of stuff and you know you have a chance to be a Monday morning quarterback\nI see you've got to be careful miss as you try to build up the case I Know why because Mitchell was so bad and building up anything now this is interesting I Wonder if they live in the same household 'cause we have\nCarol in Florida and sundry in Florida and they both why one's a little different before planned her testimony or let's go to that first the other one says red testimonial paper maybe there in the same household let's talk with mark\nHigh I care parent high high\nI doubt if I let them know that there are parts of the fact that characterize that lab work right now that are called black worked on that show and I am against is lying about whine and cry she had to lie after lie after lie under oath\nNumber one she took off her social media and plan for it that I did have nothing to hide wider to remove all of it the Romans every drop that had to deal with her since she packed\nSecond according to the taxpayer money from\nThe comfort that she and her husband rent rent they were having marital problems and the counselor and she had the proper yard\nThat to describe Cirque occurring during the last to perform that ran pop sell this car crash so now my only can make it very easy to catch cab or not but that's another lie\nLetter why was she was flying a serial killer freighter why well that's ridiculous she and her husband fly all over the world that was another life why was he hides the fact that her brother\nHas that relationship what Peter\n\nIt put a little bit my love but only three people were low so I think that that needs to be investigated Islam yep no an awful lot about the woman that was very emotional\nI felt that women really relate and emotional testimony mhm and they find it hard to get back away from it but it was not factual did you hear an actual question not done\nCare did you hear the code ice kinda paraphrase what Thomas duck Thomas all said that you can't confuse the motion with facts right she was really good on that emotional level right and and a lot of women especially about others related to that but you just sit\nThere but that has nothing to do necessarily with it being ... to ... go go to your job now okay\nI Will go but his shoulders are saying to me that people are so affected by this or even the President Trump doesn't seem to be as as emotional you guys are said oh no see what happens he's a\nGood man he's a fine man but this was really upsetting since the OJ Simpson trial maybe were struck I was on for Larry Elder one day when the the struck testimony happening I mean this is really hitting people hired by the way the response all this is you got to come out and vote you got to come out of such big numbers\nThat it it makes a huge

Annapolis, Maryland Jack you're on with mark jab\nYes mark thank you sure uh there's a point that seem to be being I'm not talked about and that was at the beginning of the question of Dr Ford she was asked her how she found out about the party and she said that there was a pool boy attendant or a friend that was at the pool told her about it\nAnd and she ended up uh you know going from that information [noise] she was asked who that person was then she said she wanted to keep that person anonymous well I think that's a key point from the fact that there's an individual out there who can tell who held the party and we're the party was because that person told toward\nWhere it was [noise] well I understand the anonymity but which is a very important point we have someone who she identified who she not willing to say who is who can place her at the party and bank ... who held the party\nYeah I I missed that part I was probably teaching at the moment but if that happened I it seems significant to me if you have someone who can ... your story at least pleasure their rights and in fact maybe he knows when it happened where a lot better than she does right that doesn't make sense everybody\nSeems to be focusing on how she got home but I think we need to folks and how she identified that part of why we're the party was and what was and they seem to be an individual who told her exactly that information we shouldn't be able to find out who it was then cocaine corroborate the whole thing or cannot [noise]\nYeah it's you know what's really scary Sean\nThese guys are doing a better job with the questioning that Michel ... there are you guys are asking stuff had been some of it may be a little lost there but\nUh I I I thought that was fair game also and suffer and one of my friends of tennis at the me something about how to cheat she said she could people couldn't hear but yet she heard them laughing there are so many things that one could have asked her about it maybe would've caught her in the inconsistencies but it seems like they treat her with kid gloves\nAnd they didn't treat cabinet that way um let's try see Sanders ready now because we're about to

AOL dot com and mail K. I. S. L. E. R. N. A. O. L. dot com Dennis me back tomorrow which many of you've done over the years and I appreciate that very much and you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter ... show and you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis or\nLarry or whatever in the last star talked about the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh's nomination hearings and how despicable many of the Democrats on the left we're in our and many of you calling in stay there and try to get two and a little bit I just wanted for some other ideas out to you\nI watch the first to consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams\nHere's the quotes is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt to be punished for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished but if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned\nPerhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial for innocence itself\nIs no protection and such an ideas that were to take cold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end up security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way\nAnd the Democrats sites are out there know what their unleashing do they care\nThey're destroying one of the basic tenants of our republic the presumption of innocence they are asking for trouble they're also asking for trouble if they want to go back to high school and check everybody's teenage years\nAmong us is so proud of those years and where's the bank account of thirty five years if he even me what he's accused of as a teenager I thought we at least the left I thought they believed in redemption and they haven't at the left\nThat wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offenses\nBut now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high ears and by the way I Believe you confess to some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the Senate\nAnd I thought Joe Biden plagiarized while he was in college how could he was vice president and senator cotton tweeted\nSenator watch this I knew about this but here's the tweet senator Blumenthal lie for years about serving in Vietnam which is all you need to know about his courage and honesty maybe he should reconsider before questioning judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nEven the New York times reported that this is me now Blumenthal has said he served in Vietnam when in fact as the times when the ... at least five military deferments and eventually landed a spot in the marine reserve where he used was ... was officially guaranteed not to serve in the conflict itself\nSenator Blumenthal ask Kevin off he was familiar with I mispronounced Latin also seen you know it's also sitting on the bus which is a legal principle that dictates jurors can rule a witness to be false and everything if he says one thing that is not true [noise]\nExcuse me senator Blumenthal but that does that also apply to you or do you have a six different now for lying\nI watch these hearings and I felt like I was living in an alternate universe tell me if you felt the same way if you're on the other side of I'll take your shoes and the other side of\nI Want to get calls from people who disagree why it all makes sense do you want to prayers seven seven six\nNow another thing I Want you to considers this in my home state of California I suggested on Facebook that Senator Feinstein deserves consequences for her to push city and Republicans should vote for her opponent who may be further less than she is like knowledge that\nMy brother another brother suggested this to me because what difference will make\nWhether a leftist is replaced by far left is\nI remember years ago comedian Mort Saul said that voters are often given a choice between Tweedle dum\nAnd Tweedle dum are now it's much less innocent than that and what's the big difference between a choice between left and far left one at least he's telling you where they stand and going for the kill all at once\nAnd the other is a phony torturing you slowly but surely that Senator Feinstein\nCalifornia's going down the tubes anyway so\nWhy don't we let them get their quicker I live here\nSo we might be able to pick up the pieces sooner some day or maybe they as they've tried to do they can succeed and form their own Venezuela here\nRemember Governor Brown thinks global warming is the biggest issue we face and he is a sworn enemy of President Trump\nSo let them go to their left his utopia and let's get the pain over with what do you think of that idea let's get Republicans to vote for senator finds things far left opponent and give her some consequences for her to plus city tell me what you think of that idea to add one a prayer seven seven six [noise]\nIt's time we realize we're in a civil war with the left for the soul of this country so then you can tell me what you think\nThat at the phone number that I just mentioned to you and just listening if you didn't hear the first hour the\nEmotions the outrage that this was captured to the American people like nothing else I don't think maybe since the OJ Simpson trial because maybe ... people out there are starting to realize what we're in that the lie and they'll do anything to destroy somebody\nAlright I promised I go to your calls so let's go Tom has been waiting forever Tom and blend or you're on with mark\nMarket is great to hear you substituting tools to Kurt ... for that is I can talk to you again I really miss your old Saturday Night show a few killers guile when you\nYou got to check face because I Do other stuff too so just to see where I Am okay so\nLet's say mark from the depression or am I to press is thirty five year old granddaughter is for the un I tell you I I go totally nuts without without sweethearts bark when you call Jeff Flake or pool is only one thing wrong soaking fool [laughter] walk\nOr that you know the Democrats have fallen in such an ardent ... elite heat in the lead the moral of when you disagree with your hater no matter what the foster victim\nHood constantly this day and\nThe constitution they're good for ya market personal freedom we know that in the socialist state of California an\nArt lovers of socialism ... government crushing people in the most ... just look at that as a way like your mark my theory is if we don't vote them out and it's real suggested we must\nThey will get a stranglehold almost in perpetuity on Supreme Court\nThey will do anything they can push their freedom killing socialist agenda and the future of this country as a once great\n... wearing them their founding fathers created will be forever gone\nThanks Tom and you said a very well how can I can feel free to say this Bill Clinton's line I can feel the pain out there in the in the obvious and let's go to a I like Josh in San Antonio is question or comment go ahead Josh\nHi Michael sure\nYou know I just wanted to basically say that ah you know in my own reaction any way to the testimony early or testimony which I think Republicans may have gone at it a little bit\nWrong angle I think maybe that they were when you come on you can't really question anybody memory without coming off a little bit ... especially in a time when you're talking about starting to think that they should have basically just said hey we understand that you're you're you've been going through rock climbing company might have happened to you\nAnd your incredible without questioning that at all I think that what they should have done it that\nIf the if there was a terrible situation where somebody brought you evidence or brought you in an election accusation but no evidence what would you do and they're not giving her that off and she would have no no chance\nHow come the damage to the fact that judge Kavanaugh says mom was a circuit judge was involved in foreclosure proceedings against her parents in the nineties not too long after it's ruled against them and they lost their own\nYou're going to be black on every conservative talk show that there is an idle here when I was very\nYeah but we're back to a story about she's not the one on a trial and she's not the one trying to be a Supreme Court justice\nSo in that sense I ... and you've got to be careful look\nYou know now I'm going to be trying to see Mitchell side the prosecutor side right they they picked a woman in the first place because they didn't want to eleven men questioning or the fact that we've come to this point in the stage of America where you're the gender matters of the people questioning you just don't want the truth and you don't want the best people for a job\nThat you got to have someone or what did I just read California just ... I think brown signed this\nThat on the board of directors they have to have a I don't want it to women or whatever you want to not force companies have we women on the board why not just pick the best I said for years if you could get me and this was obviously relevance nine conservative black women on the Supreme\nCourt I'd be thrilled I don't care what their gender is why we gotten into this\n... it's not the world was thirty forty years ago companies should want to pick the best people but in California no you're mandated to have a certain number of women now so going back to my point to defend them they thought if I had a woman they wouldn't look bad I mean the Republicans were afraid of our own shadow right\nThe courage is not there this flight cause someone\nA costume or wherever it was an elevator on the floors of the Senate whatever the starts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to\nSuggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're we're the courage Democrats or give them credit for one thing\nThey circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in that's been the problem with the Republicans do you really know what we're up against for them this is war this is their religion this is their God for many of them a lot of them probably do believe in God that's not my point\nI'm trying to say this is everything to them who gets on the Supreme Court because they've been using it to legislate and I understand why you're so unhappy [noise]\nUh someone said something about the less than I Am maybe they dropped off at waiting over an hour but let's go to Trisha in Denver, Colorado Colorado Tricia you're on with mark\nHigh pressure I think we need approval or desirable and and I go to ...\nAn hour so relative to what tools drinking behavior to operate there even relevant at all we were still took\nFrank insurance that we know\nFor narrow and went to an all time period or back worldwide on indefinite period that ... that entire adult life\nThat are are we shouldn't have accepted it right and when she when Jack and green who called the ... [noise]\nI I'd like it but you're you're leaving out the part I just went over they don't have courage they're afraid of their own shadow that's that by the way that was one of the reasons President Trump\nIs so enduring to so many people yeah it gets himself in trouble with his tweets\nBut he's like the first president to really stick up for what he believes in any you you can't push 'em down you know and cut them off\nOr any actually says what he means catch some self in trouble a lot of times but isn't that what makes them so enduring that well we've been crying out for instead of these mushy Republicans and and a little more Collins of Maine and Murkowski of ah\nThe Alaska and I mentioned in Sean just reminded me and Ann Romney goes ahead and says I support this week to\nHit us why Romney lost I was going to mention that to me we're we're ... we're willing to do battle see the Democrat skip is the left gets it and we don't\nWe're Denis says it all the time we're in a new war I might be civil let's hope it stays in a sense that now there's no bloodshed although I worry about that very much when I listen to your emotions I listened to the emotions of the other side\nAnd this is scary where it's come where you could just make allegations and that's it and you could ruin someone's life\nTell me what you think Marcus of does [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] nice to see new\nCloser slamming citizen approaches false which was his wife ... all of us with capital investigation ... see\nI watch those senators on the Democratic side and I thought it was a disgrace and partially

political experts on to give us they're taken where this all going and what it means for the upcoming elections as well as for the future of the Republican\nThere Sean steel Republican committee men from the former great state of California you can't say that but I can and artist Steinberg political consulting pollster and writer of whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump a political odyssey well gentlemen I don't even know where to begin the callers are still there but\nDo the parents have been accused of surprise you even in the first place [noise] earning about ...\nYou know if I if there were the vast right wing conspiracy which I was the head when she came forward to\nThat she would have been ... dismissed it but of course it would've been pre supposing the Democrats were wholesale liberals like Alan Dershowitz simply would have said\nLook if I were Dianne Feinstein and she weren't interested the blood sport of gutting this nominee a while we are mid eighties is her final swan song bare witness weather came to me the staff would have looked really pursue look if you want to be anonymous and there isn't any cooperation there it's a long time ago this doesn't come across\nThe threshold for me to pursue and I wouldn't be the end of it\nAnd aren't speaking of Dianne Feinstein sacrifice when did you I don't know if you heard me suggests that Republicans and you're the national committee men for public after Republican Party in California that maybe we should vote for her opponent so there's some consequences for what she's doing but she did\nThe top two primary system is another unique listeners should know that some other disasters major at California that you're allowed to vote for two people doesn't matter\nOnly two people who get the highest number of votes regardless of party affiliation with no primaries any more minor parties have disappeared in California so I'm not constantly we get one crazy Democrat too far left wing ... Democrats\nAs our only choices for us I Know we can't even write in a terrible idea you Democrat activists say the Republican activists have at certain ... shouldn't folks love it and it and so what we have is a dying Feinstein or as as a left wing opponent and Sean steel talking about for either one I Can't even right in what about what about\nMark suggestion that these people are so upset I tell you this I I felt like calling the measure fights on campaign Bill Carrick cardio for many years and say you know\nWhat you're going to have those is the average Republican voter the average Republican or that's what we should just get it doesn't know that Kevin daily all her opponent is more left wing than she is so they're gonna viscerally react against Feinstein voting for the other Democrat but you do for your people naturally listening to the show they say California's a wave of the future be where what this is is\nThat when there was a so called primary the top two vote getters go into the general election matter what so if the Democrats are strategizing and take over your state when November comes you'll have a choice between bad to worse now\nThat's what it is that's what I said it's ... it's not only mine the other people to suggest that it's I think we should vote for her opponent and maybe she won't wins\nRight if you want to be tactical do you say okay if she gets reelected you hit or eighties she's getting less less energy I just watched the way she walked to the podium to talk to Senator Grassley their hoops Elvis dot super high energy there what does he get Kennedy learned he's a younger person he's gonna be around for years so he will have seniority that she'll have but he'll be a threat to us for a while\nI posted this on Facebook people are upset with me and they did say what were the ... that for dying find saying she was like more or less a kind of a semi acceptable Democrat because she wasn't as crazy as as as her colleagues\nBut now she's joined that that that group and now we're back to the Salem witch trials in Salem witch trials relationship to say the broad right I was going to say exactly but this is an Salem, Massachusetts and sixteen id to they can you know there were ... there's a hysterical people that were making crazy accusations against a number of women they were hung\nA and they were accused of being which is and it wasn't even against what they did but it was it was there with ghost that did terrible ...\nFull disclosure is I knew she wants to you when he was in high school\nI'm not no no not you know let let that go I don't want to hear any more about that I Will do on it\nYou know what she credible some listener picked on me saying all your talk shows are saying she has some\nMeasure of credibility ... she was extremely well prepared she's a psychologist she's done this whole like she's been practicing this role for for many years to come she had a group of very smart media savvy lawyers\nAnd the no she wasn't I thought she gave a good story and that was in fact there was a great presentation but when you dig into and you see that nothing about her story her life story makes any sense at all\nWhat you say that and I agree with you but Republicans or didn't say she was incredibly what are your callers I think the key points we always start out by giving her credibility there\nWell you know because we want to be courteous ... not to be angry against women and and the ... and possibly somebody who was actually had this experience pitch you got the wrong guy and she probably knows in her mind in her heart of hearts that she got the wrong guy but she's ... she's a tool often but you know it's like our\nOur party they leak the fact we're going to have a women or a woman that question her because we don't want these Republican males\nSuch a self to your your consult right so is that a smart move terrible first of all it was a good move that to have these senators not grandstanding ... you know Ed Ed Royce when each of the foreign affairs committee they hit ...\nAnd I looked at it was awful but it wasn't that he's competing but every house member wanted to have their day in the Sunday or their Fifteen minutes of fame so there was no choreography no strategy snow coordination\nSo they were wary of that I get that but why should I have to read the New York times Washington Post is going to be a Republican tactics secondly they never should have done the traditional thing alternating Democrat Republican and giving a ... I Know she ...\nShe was ... I mean I've been crossed with them if you have 'em in them you want to keep going keep the we have lawyers on our site there US Senators who\nAre so it ... that they agreed to this form it rather say look all Democrats could go through August up there when you were done we're going to have our a personal question or\nThey should have had you there was a again the Republicans were in a bind there they're looking at all the stats and the polls and women are angry and they've been walking away as a sizable number maybe ten twenty percent of women are walking away voting against Republicans because they think Republicans are bought\nIn ... in in this hearing ... I'm going to say something a little bit uniquely never I like what Chuck Grassley is generally done\nHe's kept telling me you know and I have kept the tough schedule and look he's got a real problem at you and I don't have to face in daily life he\nHas to get eleven boast about Twenty one person committee tests and fake flavors flaking out so the whole hearing loss for one person in the universe was for Jeff Flake ... got his hearing any voted out and I told you earlier this year and I was just like name before he changed it to you know what I think it was born that way it's sad to say\nGeoff weasels yeah and then he changed thought it was but unless you're a lucky we got to vote I got to tell you something I'm grateful for that now flakes got another week going on with us I think it's actually good and I'm going to tell you my cold calculating political reason yes making my team very angry fired up their team's been angry and fired up\nFor two years now it's about time our team wakes up understand smell the roses we have a nasty enemy here\nThey're ... they're trying to take over the house representatives and if you say gets bad today wait till you see Maxine Waters in charge of a major committee that's really going to ... put us over the\nTop of it it's very serious you were to look at the Democrats take control at who would share the major companies in the house it's it's a ... gallery of having to you when you see people who are going to be an arm tourists\nThey couldn't get a security clearance there are people going to be having oversight or the CIA officer the message clearly it's as I said you gotta you know be enthused enough to go out there and vote and get everybody you know look at the at the at the national strategy 'cause we have a national leadership there\nThe Democrats are counting on for example getting a few ... here in California like let's say Dana Rohrabacher\nAnd you talk to conservatives in Washington or not yet energized they don't realize that this was a battle out here they just look at Republican registration so if you live in orange county right then you got to come out to dinner or what the hell now she asked national implications feel how few how she can do and make the different anti\n... and I think average voters don't understand what it means when one party controls that chamber the Senate or the house there it means that they control the committees that it is Maxine Waters there to be fulltime impeachment twenty flat\nOut not only that Orange County as the pathway for Nancy Pelosi we've got four seats at risk we got great candidates oddly enough of the four seats we got three women running the Democrats have three guys running\nSo so the so in other words what were we got the right demographics you've got the right approach or getting out spent two to one six to one and some of these races we need a muscle up and get seriously show up like the Tea Party yet in two thousand and ten so that's the conclusion we we got to get out there to all our listeners out there are women candidates were born women [noise]\nAnd it turns out our experiment with somebody so important and well the on the other hand they they they you know the the big argument at the time was you know you want a female asking questions well she's extremely well qualified or she did she had a terrible form at the bottom line is read the reader letter it it's all let's\nDo that and I I'm just going to do the points that 'cause the ones who hold on one doctor for does not offer a consistent account of when the alleged assault happened\nDr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name when speaking with her husband is number three with her husband talked for change your description of the innocent to become less specific stuck for Dr Ford has no memory of key details of the night and question\nDetails that could've helped corroborate her account five Dr Ford's account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she's identified as having attended including her lifelong friend six Dr Ford is not offer a consistent account of the alleged assault seven Dr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events\nRelating to her allegations in her testimony regarding recent events further raises questions about her memory and my question courage you should have done this and wrap it up Dr\nFord's number a description of the psychological impact of the event raise questions nine the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely affect the doctor for its account and I think these are all great point\nBecause what why did she do it a day or the the first of all we all could front is that\nYou say we're ... these are wonderful points but\nOur whole discussion is all this is on the the the the opponents turf there this is what we're discussing instead of cattle that we have to do it there but secondly you know the reality is that if this were done properly the Republicans when they were going to have her there that would have a different form and secondly\nShe would have had somebody play the role of this is a preparations there to go to all the ... wants to get\nA good crafts cross examine her editor questions where no matter what the answer your question you know what's what's your follow up question goes a long one line or the other there and then when a man erupt interruption of go into there and you looked you know I've talked to to to to me are women so we've been uh had Central Falls living out there\nBut the the point that they all hinged on is that\nThis was a girl who was not driving age who said that her her parents drove or places there but she has no recollection of how she got to this party\nThat she has she went downstairs out of the bathroom and somehow got home without telling you seeing anybody telling anybody else at the party like I'm leaving for somebody attacked me or I don't feel well or just ran out the door did she hitchhiked whatever why didn't the prosecutor asked earlier than I have to tell you as somebody who's been involved as a consultant many lawyers in in in cross examination than in some several criminal cases\nThat sounded so inherently implausible objectively so regardless of my political view there because first of all he would have expressed gratitude the person who took you always Oh thank you very much or even if you watch all the details\nA gift that would've been on your ... if you don't remember how you got there may be

that way it'd be one thing if on one particular issue they were squishy or they the they had a certain level of commitment and sincerity sued issue important to me but it's an issue after issue the country playing hard to get and constantly jeopardizing the very thin working Republican majority we have the Senate\n... self serving ... yeah go ahead well except uh they're going to be voting for Kavanaugh and I finally figured it out why not withstanding the fact that voice quit open independents moderates not to not reliable McConnell's a genius he can count the votes\nAnd are these women aren't there well I guess two of them are women look like it's like a\nA certain certainly not and and what we've learned from the from the three maybe the holdouts is that their understanding one thing if it's a Senate Democrat majority they lose all their committee assignments they lose Ninety percent of their value washing dishes el ... they're not they're not\nRealize that when the other party takes it you lose staff there and and it's significant\nAnd it's a loser all of that you don't even get invited to the New York times Christmas Party yeah you guys are too good I'm not taking Jack's calling San Antonio 'cause it's says get these two guys are on TALK show all I gave me jacks numbers the producer yeah could be who knows have the Democrats so overplay their hand\nOh gosh yeah look the party the Democratic party has been completely taken over by the class and the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been a back then sure entire life has kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems\nAnd the irony is that with all of sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still heartening for attorney general is a co chaired a Democrat\nThis is why you do when I have some conservatives talk about the ... it's all a conspiracy against or conservative and they cited a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with a public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC when it's on\nWhether it's Charlie would look at the whole Johnny rose and you probably have Ninety five percent of the other people have lost their jobs have been demoted law are for urban kicked out are liberal Democrats there because they are in power just like Sacramento here in California for those who would actually could be the same in your state capital if you have a capital where the Democrats are in control\nThan the sexual harassment by going to be mainly\nDemocrats not only that we lost free hardworking Democrats for those very charges or what is in jail for another reason as well as in for the Democrats keep getting up\nAnd you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there a while I Can't stand Al Franken the personally it is and it's politics there he probably shouldn't have left the Senate because he was groping some woman's by not not saying what he did was right or whatever but but if they want to have that standard fine because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold there so\nThat gets to my point and everybody's part what happens the presumption of innocence will this road they've gone down well not so I just this whole\nProcess here if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years the\nIncluding Democrats or where to go forward and said you know there's a reason why we have statue limitations this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school and other than a than a Senator Feinstein was it was a person of of the principal she would have dismissed us things that I Can't do you think something happened in high school\nAnd and you know what what do we have nowadays is\nEverything is considering the same level as rape or a a you know and and but it's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls when somebody in her hair or whatever and this makes it an unwelcome workplace\nSo we in effect had the effect of ... the real serious stuff of rape and all these things are putting everything on the same class what about Senator Feinstein that this is the way she wants to go out at the end of her career and L. are slow remember how she got in in Nineteen Ninety two she was watch along with Barbara Boxer and so called dear you're the one woman there were boxer defeated\nFor re surfaced a grand slam Abu surgeons in her dear old friend of mine there and Sean mentioned find something was seen as modern only by comparison your colleague Barbara Boxer all your national leaders of the national scene\nThese two people typically box which most pernicious are there and so you you know Senator Feinstein should be we're we're we're we're retired and she's saying I remember a six year term or are there and so these people just never want to leave the national stage\nThat Sean I wanted to ask both of you will Kavanaugh yet be confirmed do we\nNow I ... no doubt Ninety eight percent sure uh and that's been largely depending what called the FBI finds look there's another finding too I welcome the FBI or a asking people question to under oath one big reason most people that are going to be asking are accusers\nAnd if the accuser to the FBI centered Bradley and Lindsey Graham of both said they need to be prosecuted and I think I think for herself was going to be under ...\nScrutiny when she has a statement of the day she has makes great inconsistencies I'm did a ... adjust strongly that a U.S federal prosecutors actually ... anybody\nOne thing and this was when I realized when they see the ... century up the ...\nThe way an FBI close works at that level you fill out a form I forget the number of cars I ... I just don't or at three hundred dollars you know it but yeah and you fill out the form and you lift people so suppose I listed Sean steals a friend of mine there which I\nWould have the bad judgment is doing to me it with her they were called valley but then they go to Sean and all these nice things about me and then they say well do you know anybody else who knows a already and well I Know sham and they take it\nThen they go to those people and they say some nice things about me\nAnd they say well do you know anybody else and they keep going till they finally find somebody who's at something negative I feel is Kevin I was at six FBI clearances where they've gone to this we're done and seeing all these levels there and still to come up with something there he's probably ... you can get cheap\nYou know I think we've given our listeners hope they started out very angry and you see I think you've helped us I think you've given them therapy and it wasn't over a second door yeah but make sure that the regime lady brother in law shows up in boats that that's going to be but you guys have got to get out there in the house was the thing that scares me and it should all across the country we've got to make sure\nThey don't want to eliminate congestion district vote and if you do give some money to somebody who is it a Condes district need your help Marcus they're sitting in for Dennis\n\nDennis for your listeners get the T dot com as a special offer for Dennis listeners want to I think your level of health naturally go to get the T dot com and try our super tea for cleansing or maybe our takedown tea\nFor supporting healthy glucose or browse through our website and find what you're looking for to optimize your health\nNaturally non GMO organic and sent right to your front door Dennis listeners receive free shipping when you type in Dennis in the coupon code I get to the dot com\nSo log on to get the T dot com type in Denison the coupon code and get free shipping Dennis talks about doing good deeds and we want to join in his efforts great non GMO products\nAnd free shipping remember Dennis and the coupon codes for free shipping log on to get the T dot com\nAnd feel the difference get the T dot com that's get the T dot com\nI Can't believe the holidays are almost here again well that's not all\nThe time to review our Medicare plan and see what changes are coming in twenty Nineteen\nOh no not that again that eight hundred number we call for help last year was so confusing and I don't have time to attend to all those meetings\nNot too worried this year we're calling Tina the R B insurance service she and her team will meet with us answer our questions explain her options and help us make changes the necessary the T R B team is helping people with Medicare in Arizona for over Nineteen years NPR be insurance isn't a plus rating the better Business Bureau\nSo you're saying they will actually meet with us and help us Sarah hall this Medicare sapping sounds perfect we only have until December seventh so we better call today\nWhat's the harm so two seven five eight eighty nine Ninety eight that Vick do two seven five eight eighty nine Ninety eight or we can reach you on the Web AT T R B insurance\nDot com alter are provided no ...

to go\nBy the time we get to friday will it and just be an unholy mass the nomination dashed against the rocks and the death of a thousand cuts complete I pray not I certainly hope with every fervent bone in my body that I Hope that's not the case\nAnd um and maybe this has caused for some optimism because and and it sounds it it it sounds\nMaybe a little ... and I don't mean it too\n'cause I think that their recent events that they kind of backup what I'm about to say and that is that today's left today's Democratic Party may overplay its hand so Columbus LA\n... by the time we get to friday a whole lot of Americans and maybe more than a few senators are just going to be safe enough\nEnough there's nothing new here we've had the entire week\nBe FBI probe that everybody was raining us to do okay we did it are you happy now the answer of course for many will be no of course they're not going to be happy now some people will never be happy because you know exactly what the game is delay delay delay attack attack\nAttack a lot of people who said we just want a week just take it to friday and next week are going to be the exact same people\nWho are then going to say watch not enough it is an artificial deadline I mean why in the world where we are just trying to get the bottom of the fire people afraid of the truth oh my gosh you'll hear all of that garbage can you hear all of that nonsense and so just hopefully to Lindsey Graham in the code I played last hour\nSaid look at it I think he might have heard some of what I heard a little bit of bugs it's not that the FBI\nMight be about rapid listen they had a nice full weekend how long does it take to talk to five or six people how long does it take you know I mean how many questions you have to ask\nSo it was about uh when the FBI is going to ah to to make its findings known\nI I Will tell you I Am comfortable asserting that I have no expectation of additional damaging information vis very FBI has looked into a judge Kavanaugh six times this is time number seven\nAnd so what's the likelihood that oh my gosh he is a gang rape is what how did we miss that I Do think that's going to happen\n[noise] real quick you host a talk show you take calls and then there's a little tape loop in your head but sometimes rolls of a previous call I Want to go back to a gentleman\nUh it was very or was it was an invigorating phone call gentleman from Columbus and I I think first call\nHis main points were Republicans don't want the truth Kavanaugh's a liar a it's all terrible and you know it and we're we're just trying to get the bottom of this and it's an instruction game going on and or or a cover up going on blah blah blah [noise] so I asked him several times what\nIs the evidence what is the evidence that a doctor Ford is telling the truth what is the as ... and saw that pesky evidence that ah the doctor for it as properly identified judge Kavanaugh as a cat is her attacker\nGentleman replied with a sentence that began will judge\nKavanaugh is lying dot dot dot I said well we'll know so that that's re stating your premise you are not telling me the evidence that he's lying you're telling me that you think he is alive I'm going to get the gentleman over the benefit of the doubt I think the idea of where he might have been going\nAnd this is a concept that I I think is going to be heavily played this uh this week\nI think the gentleman's the end of his sentence would have been that he's lying about some things so maybe he's lying about others\nOkay a concept in law the juries are free if you find that other witness if you find that a witness has indeed factually lied about one thing you may have been cast whatever amount of debt and you walk on everything else that witnesses said oh that could be interesting huh [noise]\nSo perhaps the gentleman's point I Want to get I Want to give him full shrift\nAh is that he found judge Kavanaugh not believable on some other things and that struck him as evidence that he's lying about everything\nThat that's far from a from a gracious interpretation but it if if the ... but it's something that the gentleman his is entitled to however here's the thing he\nHas not caught judge capital in a lie about anything and nobody will\nNo one will that precept only applies if you find that someone absolutely proven ... has lied about something\nThat we have now is judge Kavanaugh talking about some drinking episodes and there are some people from his pass to go through you might be underplayed and the drinking episodes easily
