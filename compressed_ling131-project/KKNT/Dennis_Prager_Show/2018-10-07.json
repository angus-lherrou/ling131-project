formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress\nI'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium or we're\nTalking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list many of them is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that needs to be involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart beat who very important factor in life\nYou would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's Bastille pearls is getting\nA list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the bunny\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with no what happened is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nThough so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is ...\nThat's right they work in combination with each other out there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said he drank so it gets into your system and one of

fantastic some of those things that you've named seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's they're linked there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I like to discuss what happened is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency\nSpend the nickel museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption central way which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real gradually over time type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nThreats or whatever right and that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nBlend that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones they start getting on life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah in your body that actually starting to manifest at\nAll due to a

All right well a vitamin C. is it's not really no no\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell and unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends\nAnd the bottom line is with out enough fight him and see and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies diabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be short and by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contains about sixty five milligrams of vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three to four thousand yeah and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice\nSo because of lack of vitamin C. they weren't getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well the number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just saw any energy I don't feel like myself I'm hurting yeah and then the doctors and get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we've got to do these tasks send you through the scanner\nAnd the problem is is they don't find anything ... it's the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd what's interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. alright the other ones there aren't any pigs primates and the fruit bat\nWhen you look at the rest of the animals out there\nYou don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure\nYou don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nYeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C\nIn our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it\nYeah right but you know I think most people will get myself included think um vitamin C in terms of cold and flu\nSo we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is that you know what it\nIs actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my super see twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down to have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. oh that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... is your body needs different forms of it and I put it all into one\nVitamin formula now and you said that was how much vitamin C. and your supersede twenty to forty years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that you'll\nExperience well the first thing you're going to experiences energy vitamin C. produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and

the impression the vitamin C. was instrumental in helping to boost your immune system then\nAll of these other things that we've been talking about a including being able to extend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I didn't go to the supermarket before I got here [laughter]\nOkay and I brought some vitamin C. and I went and bought these and\nI'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in itself right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well just one type of score but gas it right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... now cellulose as ground up newspaper\nOr the next one is uh vegetables Derek acid now that's an oil all over again until the pills come out of the machine when they form of\nA and the next one is a sort of like a silica sand sand like the beach\nAll right so here's another one try this one here okay so there's a national brand here right right so this was five hundred milligrams okay this is a true all yes All right so take a look at the ingredients\nAre okay I'm personally ... sucrose sugar okay ... sugar sodium a score right\nThat's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium but vegetables Sterritt Ghassan that's that lubricant again and F DNC yellow number six there you go number six so now that's artificially colored vitamin C.\nNow what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different from these that we are talking about\nWell what's different about as I used twenty two different forms of vitamin C. and it's all naturally flavored natural colors there's nothing artificial in it Chris so it's good for you and it's the only one that has this unique delivery method of being able to drink it down it's water soluble goes right to work in your body and it

University of California and it found that people who to the vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease or reduce over forty percent ... study reported in the international journal vitamin the nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes out ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C in their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Mel leaders and so those who increased their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when

I'm old a North Africa that gift from Syria from Egypt I'm from\nThe borough coal to need a deer in the middle East that they had to\nDo so on and so all of these all of these Jewish people from all of these Arab countries were forced to flee with with no single with nothing and then arriving live as as you live in Israel\nYeah there was some like I was married to a racket ball and a Jew and um\nHe took his shoes when he had to leave the fact that they liked the issues that don't get that yet Kim barefoot um do is try it\nSo and and this was the obviously a your family wasn't so poor whenever they were in Baghdad this was no life you're accustomed to\nSettle that very well off and uh but uh we ... we ... it was a shock I buy my as a child my parents they um found betting very hard\nTo manage with the food clothing the winter was coming and he was a very hot way to and um\nWe were leaving ... they gave us as being a big family they gave us a um it call it the house it was one go um and we ... the toll it was outside\nAnd it has a daughter and um you have to score the item and I used to be petrified romance and we have a four year in this place and then afterwards\nA day or the Jewish Agency had failed houses small houses ... it was with the one room at a tiny kitchen and bathroom a witness told it\nTo you you you're in an older sister was in medical school Roger Williams was\nAt its says one reason we really have to see is what I mean\nWe have to go it's because by elder sister she wanted to study meant is uh because she Jewish she um it was um a fuss of both by a two and a higher education and uh\nSo um my parents even being religious they move to a Muslim school and she started with most of them she was the only Jewish with another guy I'm Jewish\nAnd they went to a school on Saturday\nBut so they are\nMaybe that's what helped them to get into higher education because they allow choose to go into higher education\nWhen I'm finish high school and they wanted to end to the university my fifth that they didn't allow her to go better just to keep that permission\nMind on those she graduated from the Muslim ... yes yes [noise] at my father had to write\nA deal that quite a few people with lots of money and all that to allow uh to enter\nAnd she had to sign that when she finished her education because they didn't have a\nUnit best cities and higher higher education aid but that she had\nTo go to travel to London and to study that and then come back to the fact that\nI work for the government a\nYou know they like paying them back\nIn time and this was in so this was the type of family that all of a sudden are now refugees\nLiving in tents in Israel and are using an outhouse for a bathroom and getting me once a week and things like that\nI was awful I mean uh it's not like um they left out okay they are running away those are\nNow they call them Palestinian the I don't believe it down today a left and from there on a code because of their what tone\nBefore Nineteen forty eight they they were told at that uh if they stay outside that\nThey what a threat now has a bad day what they're going for decades or a owned the army Egypt Jordan Iraq or Syria Lebanon and all all the Arab country\nIf they do the ... the Arab League is ready to get out there out so we can\nKill it would be easier for them to kill all that ... inside and then when it ah finished it can come back and check everything\nYou know this is what makes this story so interesting too because people in the west don't don't hear this younger all the time about the Palestinian refugees and all they lost their homes and\nHow they're driven out of things and they never hear that it was the Jews throughout the middle east from every single Middle Eastern country like your family in Baghdad they actually driven out they were driven out with the closing their back they had nowhere to go except Israel whereas the\nPeople who call themselves Palestinians and claimed the refugees they were people who were never forced to leave they packed up and moved out of their own accord in the hopes that the Arab armies would white kill all the Jews there and then they come back early\nYeah it was some Iraq that state they ask a lot I Know that uh because one economic in my class when we were very good friend she was among for them\nNow called them understand yet we what's going to get it from the age of six\nAnd I'm Adam and they said that we asked them how come you state and and they said uh you know they told us that we ... we decided no we're not going to be happy land over here\nAnd uh they stay there was also and I don't know a Christian stating talent and that they will either Muslim state in town it just ... feet tall\nAnd the Arabs the speed became Israeli citizens and they have their own parties are alone and\nAbsolutely and and they\nContinue to on land that\nThey had before the creation of Israel continue because I used to go out and said that had to build a plan I Need to not like it I say that um you\nKnow they kill them and throw them out and they both said how come I mean we tend to those so called houses that one no nothing that I don't think they took everything with them so\nAs you don't do factories or do as a basis a book and because the only ones that is the is the Palestinian's\nNo this is such a country I mean the ... the ... the Arabs experience was so different from the ocean to the Muslim it was because of the Jewish Arabs refugees were like the\nEuropean Jewish refugees who came to Israel they didn't stay refugees they didn't stay in tents are camps or they became successful they\nCould on a on a date and happening one day or one week\nEight so I took time and they failed and they help ... uh you know to the to the old that they will own immigrant it is but I still have older and going to a kind of making a movie that I Know\nWhat happened with your with your family your parents and your and your siblings as Israel was starting to build up\nThis thing my parents bought bury a team that we all have a good day that you can't ship and\nUh ... how much my mom and my other brothers and sisters they were all to if they um except my eldest sister she went to continue as bad in medical school in general to them\nAnd uh as that race we had to go to school and study because it is according to my parents are very important and suddenly you know my father started to work at the state agent and\nUh it was an easy it was an easy at all and we didn't have to lock showy things I don't remember I never had to do the whole game or any any toys but I'm with the with the job of children in the neighborhood\nAnd and everybody was in ... everybody that you were around in the same kind of connection on refugees\nYes and you know something everybody was laughing I used to I used to us from time to time you know and my parents would talk about how a a luxury life flight back dad how much they had everything and I I ... my father one day\nI said to him I Do a great thing\nAnd that you came to is trailing in the ... even that you had to go through so much suffering and that he said that they thought\nI steam when things went back to Israel and asking what you liked it but not all the way to go back to back that would like to go if that definitely though\nSo this in this was this was true vulgar vulgar on Iraqis yes Iraqis\nFrom and then then the in general the the the Jews these Middle Eastern Jews who were refugees and they're right there with refugees from ... survived the Nazis from Germany and Poland and Russia and this was a country of people that had been dispossessed and uh and yet\nSomehow the\nPalestinians to the people who call those proceeds today they seem to have built in a pre\nNo no no of course going on in Gaza in two thousand and five ... Israel left gossip ... it when they say it's ... it you know a guy that you know the ...\nAnd uh every should get a lot of I Gotcha feels that she built before and she gave it to the Palestinian authority at the time it stand up then the battle think stopping to build an animal\nBetter themselves they destroy absolutely everything over that and now they're sending are okay the making of a demonstration\nAnd guns or you know about this goes is right next to where you came from and we'll talk about that when we come back from the break think\nWatermark well strategies in watermark will planning offices at sixty nine hundred east camel back in the camel back to ours has been a loyal sponsor of this program since the start\nWho specializes in wealth retention state and legacy planning\nWatermark has been a leader in the ... and his members have been together for Seventeen years founding partner comments or Cohn is over thirty six years of experience and tax investments in state blaming issues affecting retirees and their assets you offer comprehensive planning that has helped us as families through the process\nOf identifying client objectives and concerns in constructing a strategic plan to address dance risking legacy issues consultations or complementary and we encourage you to contact\nSupporter for eight zero four four to three Ninety eight nine to schedule securities overthrew\nCustard restaurant services L.

because so many people in the west I think that those those poor Arabs that were forced out of their homes in in in what is now Israel is not bad at all it is it's the same people\nAs the the Jewish Arabs who were forced out of their homes in all those other countries and had no place to flee to accept Israel\nExactly when my mother was like she had the house that died in which God and so they are after the sixty seven or as they used to come and the black and ask him\nOn a regular people who came on a date that God there and they knew that she came from Iraq and she spoke up so that that

during any afterwards which were which were you the certainly the first one you went into\nA seven seven I wasn't as sitting trapped\nIn in what was that like I mean to the Israelis were they comfortable that they were going to win and they didn't worry about it or\nNot now on the country I mean in Egypt is they have a bragging about how much are they ... they had the I'm coming from Russia and that\nWas an executive at the time I'm pro Israel as much as today that they didn't keep that in so many ... all the adults at the time they will French\nAnd so obviously we look very petrified at that so many countries going to attack Serbia and I think that we didn't have the corner and hide and it was very very hot it was ... ... what's happening is thicker than war it was just a matter of ...\nI've I've heard stories about the about the tank battles of the er\nDuring the war at the Golan Heights and how can there is only four functioning Israeli tanks and they would hide

how the real risk of exposure to the markets\nIsn't discussed in the media or by brokerage houses we use no market strategies based on specialized plans that can provide first year returns of up to ten percent or more plus they include contractual guarantees that you'll never suffer a loss because of the stock market decline\nWhile at the same time you'll be locking in your annual gains\nAnd also remember no fees are loads are taken from your deposit\nThe message here is different from what you normally hear on the financial planning show largely because our concepts are different most brokers based their financial planning on something called modern portfolio theory this theory basically divided up your money and puts it into different investment categories another word for this is diversification\nThe process of diversification is supposed to minimize your losses if the market drops\nOne thing that's rarely talked about though is that it also limits your games when the market goes up\nWe have a better idea what if you could participate in some of the market gains without participating in any market losses\nOur emphasis is on preservation of your principal participation in market gains in a lifetime of income that you cannot outlive we help you set up a retirement\nThat you can be sure of markets always retest new lows but when the markets go into the next dive it won't matter to you once you've escape the volatility of the markets you'll be smiling knowing that you're harder money is a hundred percent safe from any and all market losses how do we do that\nWe stay

strategy that allows you to build up an income account the compounds that up to seven percent per year this account can be used to guarantee you that you'll never outlive your retirement money\nYou see when you suffer a loss in the market\nEven if it's a small loss you have three problems the lost value is just one problem the second problem is the time it takes to make back that loss\nBut the third problem is is it's almost impossible for you to regain your losses let me explain\nIf you have a market exposed account of a hundred thousand dollars and the market drops by thirty percent\nYour account has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful right but that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the following year by thirty percent do you think you're back to your original hundred thousand the real answer is absolutely not now why not\nIt's the cruel math of losses here's why after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand\nSo the thirty percent gain and the following year on the way back up his gain on only Seventy thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand is only Twenty one thousand and when you add the Twenty one to the Seventy that's left over it's only Ninety One thousand\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero than the answer when you lose thirty percent in the market it takes me forty three percent gain just to get back to zero\nThe proceeding information does not represent ... legal for investment advice surrender charges applied to beef contracts\nOptional lifetime income benefit writers are used to calculate
