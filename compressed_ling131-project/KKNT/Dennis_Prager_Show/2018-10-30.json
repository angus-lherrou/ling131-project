A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com [noise]\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer for as I did for Larry Elder last friday\nSaturday and continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I Want them to talk to about illegal immigration\nEspecially with the caravan approaching I've talked about illegal immigration for over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you acknowledge the simple fact\nThat people across the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out which ones those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents has if famous place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal then they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walks into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove that the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said that the left has won the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change or whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better at defining the terms and using the language to their benefit of course it helps to have a media on your side perpetuating these false it's so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the obvious\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work and President Trump and Republicans accused you heard President Obama last hour we had the clip of him of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in cold cages\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration [noise]\nHe has more I mean that would be the right word than anybody I Know President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes but the left and the Democrats and the media all from the same thing I Do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders but they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms never mind that want anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail they'll their children do not go with them to jail they're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd the in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nDallas no doubt in my my name is Thirteen and other people who would do us harm or among them so can President Trump to Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show you crying children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets into our country or a house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right to protect the American people from arm where the from terrorism or as one caller mentioned last hour disease or even for that matter to make sure that people come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico\nSome of us six or so obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense I mentioned it last hour the Democrats won more votes and the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know it\nSo you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote when he ran in Texas\nWonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA loss in politics or sixty to forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption Moshe ... illegal immigrants come here for jobs as we'd long established but they also take advantage of government handouts that the rest of us are paying for and the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering better give it up\nSo here's a phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats they always choose the real thing\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again so even even on a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it is clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody [noise]\nWhat do you say to people around the world who have been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and ins and outs you bought a national paperwork even have a chance of getting here so they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one call a lot of different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggest that border walls don't work in the long run but even if that were true I told them I bet they work in the short run to stop mass of people coming here don't you wish we had a border now as\nWe will are going to be confronted with these people in short time\nReally live safe for murder by their fence\nWe need we need to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure for coming into our country and I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed onto bearable against like Bush George W. Bush for Paul Ryan no amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior\nBut to those who say the border wall work\nThey use the same or ... I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had to be in the last hour when they say the un documents commit oh he said to call her a chance for me to have they committed mass murder no it's not unlike the argument have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans\nWho cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that wall preventing one Hamas murderer in Israel for mentoring would have said that Israelis life\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals are given safe harbor\nYou come up with so many arguments like illegals will not cooperating with the authorities you've heard this if they know they can be apprehended are sent home\nBut how about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with the Saudis how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes than native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers and ice who had the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes some of the rest of us have to live with long waits of hospitals deteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls in their gated communities so\nWhat's my solution I said I Would give it to you take away the benefits like free health care and preschools you force strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some see CEOs to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would stay for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake please enough of the government sending out the wrong message with bilingual education classes or bilingual government documents\nA country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our values\nIn order to find a job they gotta fill out of nine rainforests and when they do that and say they are here legally that commit perjury which is a felony\n[noise] oh the other thing is is that they routinely make up Social Security numbers but worse you know somewhat the Social Security numbers a separate Immigration Studies suggest that about Seventy five percent of the illegal aliens that are here\nTo work [noise] uh had been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a myth my daughter was actually a victim of a ... by illegal aliens using her Social Security number which were stolen which was a child mhm so uh I don't know why the conservatives Republicans\nDon't push back on this whole illegal thing\nOh by by describing what's happening here in internally when people come here to work [noise]\nYeah just a ... one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that how someone gets into a country we call that legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to the people you want to give the opportunity to\nHe seems so obvious to me and that's why you have to have the when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of whipping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states of America yeah legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nThanks for taking my call mark I guess on one thing that's changed a big lost all I mean if you're a fan of course they want they want the either\nPathway contaminated we and the out a solid darn Guatemala decent people for the most countries that pose country just gangs and so she and her team at all what you want to tell\nYou all know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that they are they're going to be terrorists among them they're going to be people that don't value the ideals that we do in the United states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been ... as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing this some orderly process that stole point his argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do it here are the rules here the procedures you have to follow them ... President Trump's Republicans are going to lose this one either way right you call out the national\nGuard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joins in with that trait\nAnd if you ah do stop them you have an invasion you have people coming in these people aren't coming in for something that maybe some of them but a lot of them we know that kind of I don't blame them by the way to coming in for jobs that come into the benefits were\nThe ones to blame let me know what you're

regarding that all the immigrants\nAre going to be thinking that they are able to get across the border on my husband union carpenter and\nUnless you live in an area where the unions are strong very

of happiness in terms of meaning in terms of many things so this is a big could be cold I guess the map show\nOr the where to go on the map show but it's the ultimate issues hour and I won't give me all again I'm Dennis Prager thank you for being with me\nSo of course Semitism is it in the news so let's deal with it on the ultimate issues hour and I will offer you some thoughts I have written a book it's that it's a third edition it is and never been out of print I began it\nWoo hoo many many years ago and it's\nBeen updated enough data updated but the central to use his is identical to the original if throats in each subject unfortunately it is the greatest hatred in history a greater percentage of Jews have been murdered than any other\nA lot ...\nThan the group that we can we know of and uh if he has a\nUnique aspect is key unique aspect of Jewish hatred whose name is anti Semitism is to bed at ... ... ... Eighteenth seventies and Germany and the unique aspect\nIs that it is always annihilation est works determination as to people who choose want them all wiped out they don't want them and slaves were persecuted\nThey want the White House and\nThat's an amazing thing in every generation that has been the case there was for the group that as well to to annihilate two Jewish babies there for hours targeted as they were by the ... Jewish adults so explain a little bit about that but but the book is why the Jews the reason for Semitism the greatest predictor of evil\nAnd I think you'll find it riveting why the Jews wrote it with rabbi ... many many many years ago and again it's been updated in up to the third or fourth addition published but I wanted to buy three publishers Simon and Schuster [laughter] so I'm going to troops there\nAnd help her columns and Rick Murray Roger we published by bubble coming from a beautiful job or motivated [noise]\nSo I have a question for you as I can use them for ... some unlikely to call and we are told repeatedly today that there's this tremendous growth in anti Semitism in the United states uh so I have two questions one\nDo you think that that is true whether you're a Jew or not a Jew I Want you to to tell me what you think the you experience it if you're not Jewish I mean are you hearing more a Jew hatred in and talk with Jews or not president\nOr if you're a Jew or you're experiencing a anti Semitism at work or on your dry from home or anywhere else I I have not even my mail and ... I'm I'm pretty well known in the United states and\nWhere it's ... mail I mean there are others who do I kind of like I'm not saying that they don't I don't deny for a moment but I get very very little old am I ever I've not seen any increase the people who hate me hate me because I'm a conservative them up because\nI'm a Jew\nSo I uh I'm I'm just curious I really am curious maybe I Am not aware\nOf this increase that is allegedly and maybe factually taking place I Know it's taken place on college campuses that that but that's all from the left and from Islamic students that it's not that stuff from the right but that is true if one wants to identify\nA anti Semitism and it's increasing you say well that's anti Israel yeah but there there was very little difference ... if the only state on earth you target is the only Jewish state on earth than I'm Sorry but that is anti Semitic okay let's please save me save me the uh the nonsense\nThere are two hundred and something countries but the only one that I work to it destroys the Jewish state but I don't dislike Jews oh okay so you don't dislike Jews it doesn't matter [laughter]\nAnti Semitism does it mean dislike Jews\nMeans work work to annihilate them how's that\nYes there has been there is an increase on anti Semitism on the American campus but that's not what the people who say visiting present I Semitism are talking about they they think there's an they claim as an anti Semitism that is massively increased from the right\nWhereas on the campus it's from the left and from a ... many Muslim students 'cause it's it's target specifically Israel there were students who were afraid to wear Jewish star there there are students who were free to where you know I'm a college campus but\nIsn't that do you believe that this is in on the increase and what is your take on this uh this whole issue\nWhat eight Prager seven seven six was the ultimate issues our eight seven seven you know watch on it's been too long I needed I crave it give us the eight seven seven jingle [noise]\nOur eyes very nice job right out okay that's good okay very good show I'm joined by the way of showing you should know sang that compose that and sleep it on every one of\nThe instruments [noise]\nMarketable achieving okay he didn't\nMarket spring Texas hello mark Dennis Prager\nAuthor mark I think there is an ikea\nThere is an increase in anti Semitism and it's almost a hundred and [noise] [noise]\nWell I don't get all those things in our name and actually in the form of credit for me I feel that okay [noise] the entire oriented\nAnd I personally had um\nWe had our mind around at our\nKind of guy [noise] taken out by someone who is and we can't get it went all the playground [noise] um\nWhen did that happen\nHappen in the middle of the Obama years [noise]\nMhm oh let me react I I I just want to say okay this is an important I think you for calling I I I don't agree I don't blame President Obama for an increase in anti Semitism and I don't blame the President Trump\nAnd I don't think that conservatives should play the ... the left does even though it's tempting I don't think Obama increase the anti Semitism and I don't think that um that the President Trump passed I Do think that President Obama increased racial tension in the country\nHe could he could have in the course of his eight years re reassured a black America that this is a really good country\nInstead he said that racism is in our DNA spoke about ... even though the the white policemen was acquitted by largely black jury\nBecause he acted completely in self defense with Michael Brown was not an act of racism whatsoever for the president to say ...\nWas a disgrace to have a Al Sharpton visit him as often as he did El Al Sharpton was one of the instigators of the only problem in American history that word is ... minute as used by Brandeis University historian\nIn describing the events in Brooklyn New York and crown heights when blacks attack Jews\nAre ... they were done by Al Sharpton\nI I'm Sorry yeah yeah so basically you know as I Am not saying anything on them and in ... I think however there's a lot of ways it's become more fashionable or to express\nThings like if you're you yourself as not having access to a certain ... to like that you know you don't say well\nIt's because I'm not voted to the study had learning\nClass the stereotypical Jewish American might be\nYour water saying it's a it's it's it's good to have this privileged status similarly overseas you know you look at Israel saying well you can say well I read that\nKind of success and learning\nFor the kind of society that Israel has\nSo that that's basically it it it's sort of a a in a way distance against people who have a deep study hard work and whatever and so\nIt that we sent that causes the expressions\nWhile you're All right to your ear explaining it yeah yeah All right I think you're you're explaining it uh and I think there is that that is part of it you should all I'll read the Israel test by George Gilbert who is of course not Jewish and or she has five minute video at ... university the Israel test and he uh he explains that point\nIn his unique eloquence with his unique eloquence that he is he's a major is one of the major thinkers in my in my one of the major thinkers living\nSo he uh he he ... the resentment if you if you resent success\nNot just financial but also financial then that's part of what comprises anti Semitism but anti Semitism of course as I pointed out has been the elimination of element we will I liked him the guy in Pittsburgh settled Jews must die\nThat is very rare among ethnic bigotry is there a million ethnic bigger trees in the world this try this try this nation hates this nation is religion they just religion cetera et cetera but the notion that every one of them most die that is essentially you meet ...\nThat's why Hitler sold the Jewish babies must die\nSo it's a it's been a\nIt's a very serious hatred but again my my question is do you think it's increasing in the United states where do you think that that's a exaggerated I it is increasing um uh but it's increasing to my opinion on the left\nAware or anti Zionism had substituted for anti Semitism anti Zionism is a form of anti Semitism I ... a folks if if you have any intellectual integrity you look knowledge that\nI'll just say that the only state in the world the only people on earth to have no right to a country all the Jews is anti Semitic okay if you if you think Italians don't ever white to Italy then you're ready to tell you to tell you even if you love pizza and you love a Vivaldi\nAnd you love a a a ... the Taliban opera\nYou know ... and ... it's relevant\nOkay even if you if you if you got to a polio vaccine you could still be a semantic semi by the way these people to give you an idea of irrationality all Jews ...

very prominent presidential candidate former U.S governor [noise]\nEnded up by the way a physician and or somebody who should know a lot better Helen how we dean the former Democratic national

[laughter] it does and what Trump has tapped into is evil\nAnd eventually will overcome that because of the Republicans are always about the past and they're always about fear of a future\n... made plenty of mistakes but they are about the future at idealism and making America a better place I think in the end the whole wins over evil but it takes a long time and it works both of those working

Know I Know they're going to be\nClose to call in and say well Trump calls the other side of evil [noise]\nActually I spent some time yesterday\nI was trying to look that up about times that Trump is used the term evil to describe specific opponents look he uses all kinds of ... in in temperate language and I wish he would he just ah may have helped the governor of Florida when\nUh the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida when the race which I think is a shame because I wanted very much to see Ron descent as the Republican win that race but it's wrong for the president to call the mayor of Tallahassee a stone cold these\nUm any ages did that I I think the mayor Gillum of Tallahassee is morally compromised ethically compromise I think he has a lot of problems but this is the president of the United states you can't use that language Mr President\nBut certainly certainly Howard Dean to say the president of the United states is\nEvil do you think it's appropriate\nFor a former Democratic national chair to use those terms one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n[noise] this is one of the problems is we have just had a demonstration of evil and there have been three\nCases very prominent cases one not as prominent as the other two but it should be\nIn which really evil was displayed\nThis killing it's a double killings a homicide in lieu of all and they have apprehended the perpetrator and in lieu of all there was a guy who tried on Sunday to get into a Baptist church a black Baptist church he would stop the door was locked\nHe was armed he apparently had it in mind to kill some black people and then he found two people at random\nTrack them down or killed a a one one African American shoppers sixty nine in front of his grandchild put the gun at the back of the guys had assassinated him and then he ... a black woman in the parking lot\nAnd this was a guy who was just\nMouthing off about the N word and ah and by the\nWay has a history of violence in the history of psychotic behavior formerly married to an African American who he had also abused by beating her and using the N word with her\n[noise] um this is a real problem this is a very real problem and it's a real problem when you have somebody who sends out bombs to Fifteen people none of whom are criminals\nNone of whom are evil but you see this is a problem it is evil to try to blow somebody up because you disagree with them politically it is not evil\nTo disagree with them politically sure you can express contempt or you can express dislike for George Soros or for Brock Obama or for Hillary Clinton\nThere lots and lots of people who dislike them but when you use the term evil it puts it in a different category and it's simply is wrong\nAnd what Howard Dean is doing here is wrong it's also deeply wrong with Don Lemon did\nA Don Lemon on CNN had\nThis to say about the biggest terrorist threat our country faces\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group or any more or less in the city but we keep thinking that the biggest terror threat of something else some some some people who are marching towards the border like assuming a so we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest her for in this\nCountry is white men most of them radicalized ... up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you have a Muslim and there is no white guy and so when we do about that\nIs he suggesting we should have a white guy ban what would you ban white guys from doing how about the white guys who work with the with CNN are they okay\nI I mean should there be no mixed dancing between white guys and other guys uh I\nI mean what what is going on\nThis is

Brock Obama was extremely eloquent\nHe was almost always dignified um he spoke very well\nAnd I think he did a terrible job as president as President Trump makes ... himself\nFrequently three he has he has not eloquent or he is also an overload and and childish and all those things but not his record on appointing judges his record even on foreign policy is record certainly on Middle East policy\nAnd his record in managing the economy\nHas been admirable don't you think but it's\nIt isn't as frequently called out let's go to Frank in Newark New Jersey Frank you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYeah Hi my I was saying that I'm all over the decades I was a Democrat a liberal and now I'm like I was a Republican now independent but I've been involved in a lot of political thing you know feminism or things like that and\nAnd you know to the normal American or shutting whether they're white black there were under a lot of culture shock I call it a lot of stress in the nineties we add diversity visas and we've short corporate landscape change and when I was at Eighteen the illusion\nYou know the American was the minority a lot of times the American lost their job and they ship and somebody and and and this has nothing to do with the synagogue shooting but I'm just saying a lot of people are angry and people have to understand that there's\nTwo angry group shares that just minorities and the black men and women the regular average person white what have you done have been going on for far too long\nI look I agree with you I think there's too much anger and the United states so what are you saying should be done about it\nI don't think the founding fathers and be aware of the factions here very smart either the constitution and he's out as you should not be practicing identity politics and and showing them and we're working with these groups everybody's supposed to be equal you don't give them positive rights because this is what starting all the problems\nWell the the point is you don't give people or you get people's rights based upon\nTheir status as citizens of the United states not upon special status of a citizen of a certain ethnicity or certain heritage and I think\nYou're entirely correct It's one of the reasons that one of the most toxic ideas which by the way it seems that the Democrats have largely ... dropped as this notion of reparations and I'm Glad that's gone away appreciate your call let's go to I'm Joe in Los Angeles Joe you're on the Michael ... show\nThere Michael how are you I'm well oh go go ahead I I ...
