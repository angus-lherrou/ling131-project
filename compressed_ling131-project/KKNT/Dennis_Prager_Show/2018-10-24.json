Wednesday the second hour of my show is devoted to what I Believe it's the most of us talk about men and women in the media at this time\nAs I often point out if it is not the most honest then I salute\nThose who are more honest\nI'm totally prepared to be in second place on this\nBut I I don't know where that might be found at this time and the reason is I don't have a male gender agenda or female agenda another man fan or a fan I'm a good people than\nAnd there are just as many good men as good women and just as many awful method that's just the way it is it's almost perfectly apportioned\nFor every foolish man there is a foolish woman and vice versa for every good man there was a good woman by and large by and large in some societies you will find more of one type than the other I think\nBut any in any event good people don't grow on trees whether they're male or female my topic today\nIs the column that I Britain and this week and it is largely about young men and the question of ambition and\nOne of the things that renders men mass killing in the eyes of women or at least that was the case for all of history and I am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that perhaps for young women today it is not the case I Would love to get your input on that particular issue incidentally but\nBy and large one of the most appealing traits if I may say ... renders a man sexy if it's one of the things to a woman is ambition knocked\nCrazed ambitious miss narcissism no ambition I Want to get ahead I Want to be successful\nAnd ambition for all of western recorded history\nWas largely I Wish to succeed at work and I wish to provide for a wife and children and I wish to provide for a family\nThis is one male ambition this is when I was certainly when I was a kid this was what was assumed it was so so much of a given it wasn't even articulate it because it was just assumed\nWill you grow up and be able to take care of a family that was male ambition\nAnd my sense is that that has been a killed for many young men because it has been killed\nIn this society the notion of raising men boys to be men first of all is a it believe it or not is almost considered\nArchaic today a be a man that is so sexist be a man or a data show patriarchal or some other is unbelievably destructive adjective useful\nThing for a boy to aspire to be a man what is a man a man takes care of the family\nThat is the primary suck the only thing that constitutes a man obviously but it is for most males that has been the defining element camp will I take care in all senses of the word we'll like take care of a family\nSo my assumption today is that this ambition has been shot first of all a lot of men for my generation to today even more so today\nWe're taught that hey you don't have to take care of a family in fact you don't even have to have a family there's no real compelling reason for you to get married and if you do the female\nWill pull her weight as they say she will will hurt or just as much as you will roll your or you were all a boat\nWith two or as men and so the notion that I as a male will need to take care of a family is is considered again patriarchal an archaic do you agree that's my question do you think that the the man of ambition [noise]\nI I Wish to get ahead I Wish to succeed uh I Wish to take care of a family that this is endangered species I obviously acknowledge that they exist may exist even in significant numbers but I'm the question is proportion\nSo if you especially if you are a woman or she will have a daughter who is dating\nOr do you have a sense that this is taking place\nThat what I have described is in fact what is taking place or a this is an alarm that is not worthy of being sounded because it's not a big deal one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThese are the numbers to talk to me if you are dating if you have a son you might have a son for example who is not particularly ambitious who was a more than happy to stay at home and uh you know make a living but not not not really aspire to more I have this sense as I told you\nHours I mentioned I didn't tell you I mean it emulates but it's my column this week is about\nMy wife and my experiences test driving vehicles last week at five different dealers in the Los Angeles area\nAnd my sense and they were all wonderful people are there was this and there's no knock on them but my sense was that\nThese were not guys who were particularly a ambitious particularly passionate about their work and you could say well maybe they're not passionate about selling cars yeah but it doesn't matter you still have to be passionate about your work even if you don't\nCare about the particulars because the the more that you're passionate about your work the more successful you'll be and the more you will rise in life\nOr my father wanted to be a doctor\nHe couldn't afford medical school so became an accountant he became extremely passionate about accounting which is about as far from being a doctor is you can get but he just decided to his great credit I'm going to become passionate about my work otherwise all too well at it\nSo the question on the table is ... young males and ambition now overly ambitious is not good overly anything and it's good to exercise it's not good to be addicted to marathons I mean is there there's no end in life to the to the\nFact that any good things can be over done\nSo I understand you can have too much ambition because then it's not ambition to take care of a family and and ambition to do good it's ambitious and to be to be super rich or to be super famous or to be super powerful and that's not a that is not admirable that's not what I'm Talking about\nBut the absence of ambition in men is in a mass scale leading characteristic\nThey major part of masculinity is indeed ambition I Want to succeed I Want to take care of I Want to take care of and I want to take care of\nThat is a good thing\nAnd it and and in the past it has rendered men desirable to a woman\nBut I I Believe that society has played a terrible trick on both young men and women it has told them that they are the same is told young women that they are sexually the same as men\nThey could enjoy any number of hookups just as much as men can with no emotional price paid and now why do you think why do you think that this idiocy of rape culture charge if colleges exists why do you think it exists it exists because so many young women have had sex that they later regretted\nSo rather than saying you know why did I get into it they prefer to use the term rape culture\nThat's that's the genesis of the a phony charges of rape culture and it's by the way this proves that it's phony the proof is the parents and their daughters to college\nNo no parent in the world what's in the door to door rape culture I mean what are we do we joking but we ... what ... what are we living in the New York times\nRights or we got that she wanted the teacher said\nOkay so he's so I gave her the examples\nOf the oil was a female teacher it was a female teacher that was it was a female team okay go on go on why did she say\nSo I gave her though right I gave her the samples and she she stopped for a minute and she said\nOh my gosh no why she said my husband feel this way when the certain shows any changes channel and she took that poster down on and on and you\nKnow well that is that is an exceptional teacher and part of the ... I Am convinced is it South Carolina and it is not LA New York Chicago et cetera\nThat's a powerful story I wrote it down and I think you and Michelle San Diego California Dennis Prager Hi\nHi how are you\nWell thanks so\nAm I correct saw here and great for taking my call so I think that today I really hope\nI think there is nothing and raising your children I'm In college than men and women are very excited when I got married it can't get at so now that that's not true\nAnd I think that's fair because you have a baby so stay on the campaign selling and why do you make or isn't really motivated to which it harder now to make money than it used to be a and\nEverything is now we have two incomes below ... children are being raised by I'm not sure who ah boys and girls after school programs and I think everybody listen\n[noise] well I I think that that to a large extent except when you know obviously quite both the homes could afford a on a few ... or at least one\nAnd you know it can work but for the great majority of people I don't think it has worked particularly well\nI thank you for that and the K lived in Cleveland high\nCame in Europe like Germany on Yes sir thank you for going\nAh I just wanted to say like I'm I'm a Nineteen year old and I I have this condition where I Want to get a job be successful and have a family\nI have a girlfriend like two and a half years like I Want to marry her but like I don't want to tell people to support a family\nYou don't happen to agree with you by the way I I don't I don't understand since you want to support a family and since you both have to live on on some income at this point\nI don't I never I literally have never understood the notion I won't marry until I couldn't afford to a show we stay on with me 'cause I admire you tremendously for your attitude but I don't understand this assumption is that you only get married when you're financially capable\nOf taking care of the other person the other person\nCan also help take care of herself in the meantime she is right now back in the moment the dentist Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nYou're losing your phone\n[noise] nine sixty knew this was or holding a suspicious device and to see it in a New York's an act of terror scot free meal with this report\nWas mid morning when CNN headquarters you ought to be evacuated after authorities found what appeared to be alive explosive device mailed here here to be a pipe bomb and John Miller the NYPD says look containing white powder also found mayor de Blasio\nWas a effort to terrorize this clearly is an act of terror\nGovernor Cuomo says there's no heightened security in certain places in the city but urges New Yorkers go about their business we will not allow\nThe terrorists\nTo change the way we live\nIn Columbus Circle Scott ...

five years old and one of the bypass relationships I got out of I feel in part was due to by lack of eagerness for ambition to really pursue a serious career I'm at the time\nMy girls and I was in school and\nUh we were at juggling the distance relationship on top of it but I I just towels throughout the relationship when she was asking\nI mean she saw fan of the best man I'll be the first but I haven't really utilize my smarts to the bus my ability but I fell into a job right out of college\nAnd just got a little ...\nAnd she has a chance to go to school with that and something else and I just never saw the fashion to drive myself the fact that my lack of maybe ambition in that sense was not something that looking for\nWell go on so what what happened\nEventually I mean that's the point we were dating a name for two years together closed down at school not the University of Illinois together um so she started we got to the point in our relationship where she lives maybe looking for me it's a either\nA further education I always thought about maybe going to school um\nAnd I never really pursuit that aspect I I was a ... a year to share I mean I deal with the hopes and dreams but maybe it was just knocked out\nThe whole putting the birds or moving in that direction and I think she was a little tired of that so we got to talking about that you started family uh shows going to delve school down near St Louis at the time and I\nWas wondering if I could say looking for jobs\nDown here to make it easier on both of us and for some reason I just got on this ... didn't have\nThe drive and me to really make any of those I think she\nI mean I could tell she is a perfect person school study hard and I respect that are like your caller earlier said I mean all of my um my ... family is\nGoing to get the father like I had the pleasure that growing up but\nUh for some reason the whole\nCareer drive of not really there isn't is it now and it's still not there\nUm I

month\nOr and packing a suitcase or again and re packing and entering a bit of a hotel room on the other hand I Walk around thinking how lucky I Am and I'm I I mean it's only sincerely just as I did when I started this in my twenties\nI never lose sight of the fact that people want to hear what I have to say how could I disliked travel if the reason that I'm traveling is that people want to hear what I have to say\nThat's why there was no happiness possible if you don't look at the big picture all their aspect is is there any job on earth aspects of which people don't enjoy though that there is no says there's no such job doesn't exist\nYou like playing baseball and you're paid well to play baseball there were no aspects of of being on a I'm a baseball team that you don't enjoy of course there are talking about travel these guys do it for half the year it constantly\nAnd the work out that they have it's not it's not all fun but any baseball player who whose mind is still intact knows how lucky he has to be paid to do what he loves\nThat's the only way to go through life is to have a perspective on on what you're you're doing so too do you enjoy every single aspect of it there's no such thing it doesn't that doesn't exist\nBy the way I just like to note for no other reason than I Would like to know what it is today is October twenty fourth twenty Eighteen and my late mother was born on October twenty fourth Nineteen Eighteen\nNo Nineteen Nineteen I ruined my dad was Nineteen Eighteen\nI made a ... my dad was a hundred would have been a hundred in July my mom would\nBe million ... million today if she was when you're younger and stuff\nYou know when you think about like the roaring twenties you think of the Nineteen twenties but we're going to be entering very soon we're entering the twenties again\nTo what a big number how are they going to distinguish between the twenties and the twenties I don't know maybe they won't be roaring the Mets maybe we'll load the roaring twenties where the Nineteen twenties and the non roaring twenties or the twenty twenties who knows\n[noise] anyway mom wherever you are and I believe you are somewhere happy birthday from the from your baby\nWow why everybody how to make America America again elect Democrats and win back the house or the Senate the emotional basis of left wing for is\nSomething I've been forming out my whole life Thomas Friedman is a perfect example of it like to read to you from man and he is considered you know one of these four liberals he's not even doesn't call him so far West is but he hates the president and Mrs do they have\nIs it a president represents everything they load the people who vote for them or low some were deplorable we are the opposite of the Tom Friedman so we are I mean it's just the fact we lived differently uh\nWe uh many of us are religious many of us uh like guns remembered that cling to religion and guns\nOr many of us are to actually get the chills met the star Spangled Banner many of us think of his only contemptible to ah purposely Neal in front of hundreds of thousands of people rather than stand for the national anthem\nAnd many of us think that the United states is the greatest force for good many of us think that it's the least racist country in the history of the world many of us think we are blessed to be American so where we were different than the guys are in the Tom Friedman world\nBut I like to I'd like to read to you because he is one of the more eloquent spokesmen he knows how to use the language that way I I don't I don't want to use a [noise]\nA bad example but the best example that the left has so Thomas Friedman in today's New York times okay it's titled how to make America America again elect Democrats [noise]\nNow the very notion that you're going to make America America and uh by electing a left wing party is is in itself and absurdity\nTo left wing all over the world which is to undo the American revolution and to preserve the French Revolution I mean to get philosophical for a moment\nSo it's an America will be made America Again by having by having Democrats in power to have a more of a a far more socialized economy as an example really All right so let's take some of the things he says in some of the things he doesn't talk about\nThe begins what is their left to say about the terrible murder of moderate Saudi journalist ... and its aftermath by the way I don't know if he was moderate or not and I don't know if it's relevant\nIf if the guy was moderate or not and moderate or what was done to him it's disgusting we all agree on that one of the few things left and right can agree with\nOnly one thing and I said it before but I feel it even more strongly now in the mid term elections vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to a voting station to vote for Democrats\n[noise] why does this have to do a well we'll we'll find out what this has to do with your Marcus jokey then he writes I don't say that because I'm particularly liberal oh really you're not particularly liberal that's fascinating is that why would you\nYou're not even particularly liberal you you're not let alone left is you're not even particularly liberal Tom Friedman but you want people to vote for Democrats Kansas for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for Democrats\nSo you want the left wing party to win but you are not particularly liberal\nOkay I just want you all to follow the logic here and wants to shift the whole country the liberal agenda I say that because I'm particularly American and I want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics\nReally the best of American values and and uh was was that it was that for example on display or when the when the rock Obama pulled out of Iraq\nWas that the best of American values and international policy was the shipping of billions of dollars to the Iranian regime\nWhich is worse W. O. R. S. E. then the Saudi regime in terms of doing evil on the face of the earth evil means hurting people in case it meets a definition\nThis is not a religious terms specifically it is not a complex term evil is the greater amount of hurt that is done to innocent people is greater amount of hurt them to innocent people by Iran or Saudi Arabia the enemy of\nThat one of the enemy of Iran is\nHere Mr Friedman so if you really care about humanity why wouldn't you while we all recognize how primitive the Saudi regime is\nAnd and it's institutions nevertheless I don't have a choice between a wonderful place and Iran I have a choice between Saudi Arabia and Iran just as\nIncest and they made it up that's why they didn't put any coach that's why they didn't say said they put suggests and so that was picked up by NPR and that was picked up by the LA Times and now they it's it's just a ... a typical example I bring you this stuff\nAll the time the deterioration of the New York times in our time but he's never attacked his own newspaper why would the\n\nDemocrats could blow it if they get to listen to this it's it's ... and the Democrats could blow it if they get back a lever of power and use adjust to bully trumping Republicans\nOh God Democrats bullying people you've got to be the does he ever word here about capital\n\nHe really takes on the tough issues Tom Friedman hey anything word there about the universities in your column\nHow you proud about what the Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh Thomas Friedman do no I just don't know 'cause there's nothing there\n\nJust to bully trumping Republicans the same way he has them oh you poor bully people but I'll take that chance because there was a basic respect for truth science and decency in the Democratic caucus you gotta be kidding\n\nTo people who deny that there was male and female in the human being they have a respect for science\nYou're You're Joking correct truth truth\nUniversities are committed to truth left ones the university's Tom Friedman is there a commitment to choose their decency\nWho who who decency as to what the democratic caucus did to Brett Kavanaugh decency you have you had the temerity Tom Friedman to speak about the Democratic party\nAnd decency the left and decency\nAfter after the the ... Republican after Republican who has gotten punched while campaigning gotten shop while campaigning ... and the others were shot at a while playing baseball sorry not campaigning\nAnd what about all of the ... all of the Republicans who have dinner and people scream obscenities in their face and you talk to me about who's more decent\nGod they live in a very very wonderful a power away from reality\nUh what else is he said I Know the two more years of the GOP holding every lever power blindly following Trump's basic disrespect for true science and decency there we go again\nTo see it is so fascinating they the they throw out these gigantic charges it's all generalized and I generally watch them but I give you specific I just gave you a specific for every example\nWho ... who was been more indecent Republicans or Democrats in the last two years\nTruth without power today is just background ... background moose Zach moved back to the march of the Trump Administration you see I can write that it's vitally important for global stability in the protection of journalists everywhere that those who executed and ordered the murder of cars show he be punished\nReally it's vitally important for global stability\nI think they have to be punished I couldn't agree more on moral grounds for global stability\nWhen was the what did he write about the need to punish the Iranian regime for what it does to journalists I was just reading a report about the rape centers in ah in in Iran\nFor women caught up were anti regime\nI missed out on the go I guess in the ah [noise]\nIn the celebration of the Iran agreement that rock Obama may backing them\nOver to the dentist trigger shall\nFactor pain free studio\nNice sixty news\nWith our Oreo con have such a package that was addressed to train General Eric holder went by friday because again the address\nIs ... send back\nTo Florida democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz whose name was lifted on a return address that prompted an evacuation and watch them in shelters Florida office today she is a former chair of the Democratic National Committee and if not suspected of having anything to do with the mailings\nTo hold her male was one of several suspected explosive devices that have been reported including now that was the right to former President Obama\nFormer first lady Hillary Clinton and CNN studios in New York\nThe latest event follow the recent discovery of an explosive device that was sent to the New York home of telling their democratic leftist George Soros in other news democratic candidate for Georgia governor Stacey Abrams is facing criticism\nFor her participation in a flag burning ... more than Twenty years ago she was asked about it during last night's debate and remark that she was a college freshman who was deeply disturbed by the Confederate symbol on the state flag and staying in the country second highest ranked elected official will be in Arizona this week\nJason ... has details\nVice president Mike Pence is expected to be at a rally later this week to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Martha makes Sally Demick Sally rally a scheduled for friday Joe Foss hangar in Yuma and hosted by the Arizona Republican Party last week President Trump was in a state ... who's running against Democrat kissed in cinema\nTo replace Senator Jeff flake who is not running for reelection\nThen she pointed patio by da take back de da take back dot com\nYour unused prescription drugs could end up misused or stolen keep them safe clean them out take them back in ... prescription drug take back day Saturday October twenty seven find a collection sided\nD.

use of bombs that don't detonate so there's something fishy going on here I've no idea what it is of course\nIt doesn't seem like they were even meant to detonate it is this some statements being made I have no idea\n... no one knows no one has a clue and if you're a betting person you should bet on both because I have no idea any more than you do and you have no more a good idea of who did this who's behind it but the political aim is\nA it is very hard to imagine that even a a crock pot writers and and the for right is that the CDC's despicable and it's not even an issue but even a crackpot

up with that but I Can't imagine I'm not saying that happened I'm just saying I can only imagine\nOr or I don't know if you're familiar but hundreds of Jewish community centers around America had bomb threats cold and all of them\nThe entire media New York times CNN the whole media blamed right winger and Trump for those calls\nIt turns out that it was an American Jewish kid was nuts mentally ill living in Israel who did it Ninety percent of those calls were made by him no one was made by a right wing or the other ten percent were made by a black radical who was trying to frame was ex girlfriend\nSo I have no problem which\n[noise] you know and\nI Know I've actually I mentioned earlier that there are a problem probably five dozen examples of swastikas painted on school dormitories

... no no no no excuse me not Mike it's the one area where either I'm telling the truth or I'm lying I have given dozens of examples you could walk just all you need to do is Google hoaxes on campuses or left wing hoaxes or right wing hoaxes on the Internet\nAnd you don't have any right wing\nI met on a farm I Would say the ratio is about ten to one left to right that's correct\nQuestion why don't you don't like treatment on your show I did I did record and I I\nI did sir I did and I I even said if you don't ... you know I don't maybe you didn't hear me or maybe you're listening carefully I'm

that's what you said something about\nIt it's just it's\nThe wrong when I was in graduate school let me finish when I was in graduate school they dropped requirements at Columbia because the students said we want to determine what we study that has now become the norm\nThey are not told in most cases what they have to study unless they have a major yes to get a degree in history you must take the following history courses that's true but they they aren't there was no general requirements in most of our universities that I stand by that because I saw it happen in my own life\nOr you know vast majority Mr Harris says\nI just said that Mike I it I just said that you are you\nSomething to be said for if you I did say that I said if you have a major in history you will have some required courses in history but general requirements\nShow what students are yours\nOkay you're you're you're or have been let me be clear of give you the benefit of the doubt that I haven't been clear\nFor example you have to take a course at Columbia courses in Colombia in western civilization to get a degree if you majored in bought me or you majored in uh in German or you majored in physics you still have to take certain courses\nIn order to get to be a generally speaking those have been dropped out over universities anyway I don't understand so that's your strongman argument that's that's my ear generalization I set up your\nTime and I started writing and like I haven't written everything out [noise]\nNo no I understand okay so let me ask you a lumber your question Mike Mike let me All right we're we've got enough on the majors okay let me ask you a question ... I think or do you think are already producing\nYou're going to say goodbye to the only thing that I go to I don't abide okay I have a religious\nCommitment the truth that is the reason people take me seriously\nAnd uh if you know we'll leave it at that time lying about their not being generalized requirements most universities okay either he's right or wrong by the good old check it out\nSee what you have to take I don't mean in a major said originally of course to me why you have a history major\nYou can only courses\nOr in a in a strong backing them on your show\nYour shoe my head and the

earth a great day despite the very disturbing\nDevices that have been dismantled in one of the things that the bomber I think is exceeded and already despite the fact that none of the bombs going off\nIs getting the attention of the whole country\nOf what's fascinating here is a lesson in how media word because it was yesterday it was last night\nThey found a bomb that had been delivering handle liver [noise]\nTo the rather remote isolated outside New York city home of George Soros the billionaire democratic donor and\nPhilanthropist all over the world I mean I guess philanthropist would be a generous term but he's somebody who is funded a lot of left wing causes and by the way\nOne thing about George Soros ... ... ... ... to view him as a fountain of diluted evil\nHe does deserves some credit from Thirty years ago for helping to win the Cold War no really he helped to fund\nA pro democracy efforts in some of the Eastern European countries and then even having having noted all of that George Soros gets these bombs and it's a kind of OK story\nBut all of a sudden you plan a bomb at CNN headquarters in the middle of New York city in the middle of Manhattan and divert traffic on the street and it's treated like an emergency and boom\nNow all of a sudden it is a wall to wall they are treating this like some kind of devastating terror attack is the only thing that has been covered in the news and outrageously this morning\nPeople were demanding where's the president what does the president have to say why doesn't the president saying\nWell he had a public event plan for later that day\nHe had a statement prepared with a public event in a statement was fine there's no way that anyone can look at that statement and find anything wrong with it in fact let's listen to the first part of what President Trump had to say about this attempted bombing and wounding and maiming and killing\nInvolving his defeated opponent Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Michelle Obama in their home and the former attorney general Eric Holder\nOr of or the Obama administration along with representative Maxine Waters apparently and we had a caller who referred to the bomb that had been apparently though this has not been confirmed planted in the same building\nThat houses the San Diego union Tribune the main papers in San Diego but apparently that same building have the office\nOf senator or one of the officers field offices in a couple of high risk so\nThat potentially could go along with very prominent left wing targets and that would be the first

by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible\nFor these despicable acts to justice we will fare no resources are expensive this effort [noise]\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\n[noise] people\nAre applauding and then I Know I Know I Know the monitor on the left if there was somebody a sitting here who is a congressional candidate and there isn't\nA from a the Democratic party what that shows you know we can never political violence but a at his rallies he ah encourage people to beat up some of the protesters I think someone with President Trump said at his rallies during the campaign\nWas stupid\nAnd it was irresponsible and he shouldn't have said those things but is it necessary for him now to go back there and say gee I'm Sorry I said these comments\nMore than two years ago in the middle of a campaign it's not necessary for him to do that what has happened\nIs he a stomped encouraging violence and then somebody's going to say well the other night he was speaking in Montana\nAnd he congratulated a congressman Greg John forte for having body slammed a reporter or who um got on his nerves it wasn't even a reporter would have been particularly hostels a Congressman John forte\nLook I think it was a mistake I don't think he should have done that and handed the other side that kind of support but the idea that that is somehow associated\nWith somebody trying to kill people and whether or not these bombs were very well made up it was an attempt to kill people or at least make people think that they were being threatened with death\nAnd it was outrageous\nAnd look there should be no problem at all with people acknowledge ing President Trump said something very good there\nHe said we should condemn political violence of every time we should condemn scuffles we shouldn't condemn people and by the way it is part of what he very I'm perfectly and very poorly try to do in some of his garbled and messed up response to Charlottesville\nOr when he said there are bad people on both sides what he said it was terrible as he said they're good people on both sides they weren't\nBut there were bad people on both sides and that was accurate\nAnd if he can go ahead and consistently now condemn people from groups from the Proud Boys to end chief uh from the un neo Nazis to ah some of the other people on the extreme left\nWho won't allow speech to proceed you know something that was just I just found out about ... and it's it's appalling to me because look I I have\nA certain affection for the physical a Yale University campus I spent\nClose to seven years of my life there\nAnd\nRight now heroine the camp has been totally defaced by graffiti and all the graffiti is excerpts from the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford right\nWhat is the point of that for goodness sake I guess the point is because Brett Kavanaugh went to college and the law school he was also there for seven years so now they have graffiti to remind people I mean\nReally that's pathetic and yes\nPolitical violence and intolerance is pathetic whichever direction and comes from and I hear you have two members of\nCongress actually former members of Congress or David Jolly of Florida who by the way is very anti Trump and Steve Israel of Florida who well surprise is very anti Trump here's how they sounded on MSNBC\nDuring an era now where violence seems to have a license for the president of United States\nAnd it's not just going to Montana and endorsing bodies slamming and it's not just saying that neo Nazis you know our people are there are good people on both sides of a march including neo Nazis\nRemember that the president and I said from the campaign offered to pay the legal bills\nOf his supporters are if they attacked his opponents I'll just say one other thing on this\nIt's not even just the president we have a bomb squad and CNN or the CNN building in New York City today yesterday I was walking in New York City I passed in the building where Fox News is headquartered [noise] and the ticker with digital ticker that displays news in the building\nWas reporting on the George Soros a bomb threat and it began with these words for the man who has everything that's not funny it is dangerous\nAnd so it's not just a president who gives a license to violence\nBut those who are enabled by that violence they have a responsibility to make sure that we are\nA racing values of a piece of safety and not pouring gas on the flames happening too often\nAnd I am gay I'm Sorry how does how does\nI I don't know what the Fox take her actually said but if it's set in for the man who has everything is he sure that that was in the context of George Soros I I don't know but it seems to me that if you are in the midst of a heated political campaign\nIs very easy to say this rhetoric goes over the top or this is wrong or the president said you should beat up protesters who disrupt his rallies that's different from murder\nAnd a yes or that John Brennan's name spelled wrong but it was addressed John Brennan care of CNN [noise]\nIt uh to the very best of my knowledge\nThere is no report yet of any other media company and the San Diego union an evening Tribune it apparently it was just the same building they were in the thing was in the mail room it was addressed that they think though that has not been confirmed yet either\nTo senator Kamala Harris who has an office in the same building\nOf this ... it seems to me um\nThe the idea is similar to the stupidity of suggesting that somehow by President Trump's intent Britain's foolish criticism of the media and I think it is foolish stupid wrong\nBut equating that with the cars showed the murder\nThat really you you want to show me that okay I'd I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin ... oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard him attacking the lying stinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something and no of course he didn't think that he doesn't didn't\nAt first of all we don't even know Solomon a mom and men saw him on was actually directly responsible he probably was but the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing fused with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when we emerged on the other end of election day whatever happens and I hope urgently ... earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut then we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWith a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they apply to George W. Bush a Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um [noise] uh go to um [noise] John Berman\nWho is an American news anchor and currently the co anchor CNN Uday with Allison Colorado on CNN he's a regular uh released presenter of Anderson Cooper\nThree sixty this is what he had to say\nThe clip them been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages and Brennan B. R. E. N.
