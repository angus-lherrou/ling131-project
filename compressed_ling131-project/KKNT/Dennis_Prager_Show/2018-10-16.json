which is that where the case that would end any democratic chances\nYeah if if I've seen figure the up to ... percent uh it's it's starting at what happened last week with Kanye and and the White

dollar question and I asked the last hour of my listeners\nDo you believe and I ... and I'll have to ask you was I asked myself no wishful thinking here okay it's not what we know hey All right not what we want but what do you think\nDo you believe that the or will be or we have reached a tipping point where the west will simply do some things so egregious I think the Kavanaugh hearings would be that example but others would differ what do you believe we have hit one worry\nWe'll hit one or will never hit one that it's the proverbial lobster or frog being boiled who doesn't even though he's being boiled how alive what do you think\nI think it's already happened I think the fact that we don't talk about James Hodgkinson every single day and that most American him most Americans have no idea\nJames Hodgkinson they just let's remember that the Steve ... was almost killed by a man who took a rifle in a hang on to a Republican majority baseball practice session but when he was killed by those two brave kept to police officers what did they find out his body\nThey found a hit list a list of solely Republican congressmen that this individual was going to assassinate stunning that you know we forget all the people who are on that field\nFor life on ... so maybe my question wasn't clear I Know that there will be individuals who have tipped over\nRight is there a point where Americans non left wing Americans will have their tipping point and say oh oh oh the last ... really is dangerous\nOh it's happened I think it's happened and I don't think it's social thinking I just look at the social media and\nThe last three weeks of the capital hearing I I was in Manhattan last week for the for the launch of why we fight and an older couple recognize me as I was waiting to get on the train back to D.C\nAnd they came up to me and they said we just quite people living our lives in in in Trenton New Jersey but we've had enough where we're gonna we're going to support down ticket Republicans because ... they did to the godly man\nAbout absolutely right just individual was truly filthy and disgusting so yes I think we have reached the tipping point when you have\n... senators like Feinstein like book like um Kamala Harris him cute the reputation of a man who who is why couldn't the driven snow I think we've already arrived us\nWell they would say yes that's the problem he is wider than the driven snow that's how sick it's become that that that's probably a a a a phrase that will be renounced but yes so you think sorry so I Want to get this clear you think that I Do too\nI think that for a not for all Americans but for a very significant number of the Kavanaugh hearings worth tipping point to say the left and the Democrats have gone too far so that it that is your position\nIf if you if you own a millennial who's sitting in some ivory tower and being brainwashed every day if you're just an average American and you look at the first five minutes of the Kavanaugh hearing\nYou've had enough I mean ... ... that was the righteous indignation par excellence and I think that's the capitalist\nWhen he stayed with Brett Kavanaugh I kept thinking oh there are even Republicans who would not have\nOh my gosh yes I mean and the way he handled it was so ... he was careful he was quiet and then when he saw all the way this man had fought for his record\nThey should just lay on the way that good Americans not just you know hard core Reagan all but just the average Americans were incensed\nWalk did he do he stood up and he he highlighted the gaping for flaws in full of testimony at his rally and he falls to the media to play that ten second clip\nAgain and again and again I didn't think of it that way\nOh my gosh I'm off the phone because I refused to cover it thank God for that that's right\nThat's exactly right the list this president I'll tell you another thing that the Kavanaugh the hearing revealed to me although I wasn't surprised this was not a revelation but the confirmation I should say more than anything else\nAnd this will really shocked a lot of people who loads of man I think he has a good horse Donald Trump yes\nI can attest to this is what Dr phil left and say or they will never believe it whether it's\nInviting the survivors the victims of the Parkland shooting to the west wing to talk to them or whether it's holding the hand of the African American grandmother whose son had been killed\nThis is who he is and the shocking thing that I can tell because I worked for him but I you know I write

have a truly a terrific guests man I have tremendous respect for Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture at the discovery Institute in Seattle\nOr would you tell people I think it's important given that we are going to talk about science and face so tell people don't be humble about some of your credentials and you're in that arena\nSure um I as you mentioned direct is a network of scientists to run out of the discovery Institute in Seattle I'm In my ... and the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge in England prior to that I worked as a geophysicist and a\nBit a double a physics geology or science degree in undergraduate and I'm\nA Britain a couple a couple of books um one signature on the cell and the question of the origin of the first life and the second one called Darwin's doubt\nA which is a question of about the origin of the first animals which uh prepare very abruptly in the fossil record in Contra diction to Darwin's own expectations of a very gradual origin for for animal life so your life has\nBeen immersed in science by the way just I've never asked you this and all our time both privately and the radio when public what does the philosophy of science mean [noise]\nIt's the it's the discipline that addresses scientific questions that are right at the margin of science and philosophy things about\nThe nature and the basis of human knowledge the what's called in philosophy is just a biology how we know what we know but also questions about a new consciousness the origin of the university origin of life\nUm [noise] and these are the ... the the topics that have always really fascinated me how did we get here how did life get here [noise]\nUm there's a huge scientific dimension to these questions but they also have encouraged believe philosophical implications and so\nI've always been attracted right at that boundary between the two and you have to learn a lot of science to be any good in it and you have to be thinking philosophically to make any sense of it\n... combination did you enjoy your time became ... really if you have to do if you have to do something is grueling as a PHD it's nice to do it in some place like Cambridge or Oxford with a lot of cultural compensations and wonderful people and the\nWeather helps the weather's awful but I'm going to Seattle so I was already in late at\nNight I never thought about his latest book which he edited is a collection of essays\nAnd don't let the title fit it in any way that you can use the evolution a scientific philosophical of the electrical critique number work the ... revolution is\nThe attempt of many and they're very good will people to reconcile God and evolution and this is a series of essays critic critique critical over that position of that position\nSo let me get to that in the book is up a dentist bigger dot com and obviously I mean if you're interested in theology or science will find this immensely interesting\nSo I mentioned the right before we went on the air that I until really I met you to be honest\nUh my my view was I didn't really care about evolution it ... it didn't bother me if it was true and it didn't bother me if it wasn't true I Believe in God as the creator of heavens in the earth the God of genesis one\nAnd if if God used evolution water why care it's all a miracle anyway so back in ... in a nutshell Ben I I read to you and talk to you\nAnd my wife frankly whose loans or a fair amount of you know about it\n... and ... and uh it has become less and less tenable not for religious reasons but for scientific reasons to\nUh to endorse the evolution as it is generally talk so before we get to garden evolution\nI Know this is ridiculous in the time that I'm getting me give you a couple of minutes can summarize evolution\nAnd why it's now I Wish I'd be skeptical about it well not not only we yeah you know say a but but the scientists right this is why you are but in my mind to scientists are having trouble with that but right right okay\nGo ahead so quickly three definitions of the term evolution for orientation first is simply change over time nobody nobody challenges that there has been changed over time or the kind of small scale variation we see in\nGalapagos finch beaks are peppered Mavs or a bacteria that acquire into a antibiotic resistant that's sometimes called micro evolution\nUm second definition of evolution is the idea of universal common descent and the idea that all organisms are connected by common ancestry back to one or very few simple forms such that the best picture of the history of life is like a giant branching tree as part of Darwin's argument the origin\nAnd the third most controversial meaning of evolution is the idea that there's an ... guided on directed mechanism namely natural selection acting on random mutations that can produce all the new forms of life that have emerged in the history of life that produces all the change over time\nAnd that that mechanism um it is also responsible for the appearance of design that that ... biological systems manifested even leading evolutionary biologist acknowledge so those are three key definitions the first is innocuous nobody doubts that\nThe second is somewhat controversial the third is relief stays on a second on the tree I'm I'm skeptical about the the universal common descent there's a lot of this continuity in the fossil record and in the genomic a patterns that we're now observing\nA but the key issue and the one that leading evolutionary biologist themselves are now questioning is the idea that the mutation selection mechanism as genuine creative power the ability to generate fundamentally new forms of life\nUh so what you hear a lot of evolutionary biologist quoting now an aphorism is that\nA mutation selection explains the survival but not the arrival of the fittest explains the small scale variations but nothing major innovations in virtue of that uh two years ago this time um I was at a conference that of the royal society in Britain the oldest or\nIn arguably most August scientific body in the world they called a conference to a assess modern neo Darwinism and specifically to call for\nA new theory of evolution many of the evolutionary biologist there were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation and selection as creative power the opening talk of the conference by Gurdon Miller leading Austrian evolutionary biologist and numerous rated uh several key what he called explanatory deficits of the\nModern version of Darwin's theory narrow Darwinism a number of the the the deficits that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis stunning the the royal\nSociety what is the ... the royal society of London it was started by Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first president was yeah yeah\nJust raving about them yesterday okay [noise] so they that's incredible that you had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation where\nWhere most if not all of the talks were were exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement compliment replace\nThe standard mutations election mechanism the odd thing about the conference however or was that uh there was a group of of what they called themselves third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nA ... but they reject standard near Darwinism so they're looking for another approach they have a there was a one group of scientists is known as the uh Alton Berg sixteen and one of the scientists who was involved in that who have called the conference declared at the end of this Royal Society conference\nThat it was interesting but it was characterized by a lack of momentous nests in\nOther words they did a good job of critiquing the neo Darwinian mechanism but nothing really was offered to solve this problem because they've injected rejected out out of hand intelligent any kind and guidance any any any like mind or purpose in in in the process by for rises so where\nAnd the and as we've understood more about the digital nature of the information it really is in its alphabetical type of graphic or digital and character [noise]\nAnd uh and we understand that by reference to say our own experience with computer code\nThe idea that you could randomly start to change very specific arrangements of characters that are designed to construct one thing\nAnd turn them into another message that will construct another completely different thing it's implausible if you take a section of computer code and start randomly changing the zeroes and ones you're not going to produce a new program or operating system you're going to introduce glitches and bugs and you'll ... ultimately destroy the function of the original sequence that you had\nAnd the genetic sequences similarly vulnerable to that kind of\nA random mutations will change and yet the neo Darwinian invoke random mutations the ages of innovation the agent of creation when in fact it's either a an Asian of destruction or it can and introduced a very minor preserve ... changes that might slightly weaker\nOptimize our eyes and when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years who have\nBelieved what you now say is not tenable what does that say if you are right what does that say about scientists that science like\nUh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to group think\nOr to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments\nIn particular in the debate about biological origin there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle known as methodological nationalism and it says that if you're going to be a true scientist\nYou have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanation for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates which would be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle Ben precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered at the foundation of life we've discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates the our local hero in a in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program only much more complex than we've ever device well where's the software come from it comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligence um\nActivity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that um\nAre a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information and know persuasive Darwinian explanation it's been offered for any of this type of complexity the integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe most likely all some aberration was born and prosper because it was better than the previous ... or ...\nOr a ... a plausible theory in the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level [noise]\nUh in the wake of that theory of a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... the explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then as the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that would in any other realm of experience point to designing intelligence that the principal of methodological naturalism has prevented many scientists

I guess about a one woman they have another thing to the big bang disturb them got on the strong did was all about to circumvent the implications of that right because it means that was the beginning and batter was annoys here right God was always hearing this drives them crazy already\nSo how do you answer they and they now argue\nThere the big banks will go on indefinitely and have gone on indefinitely\nThat's a different cosmological model but you're ... I Know that you're finished what's finished a thing of the ... really interesting okay because what they basically want is they want a mathematical equation to explain where our universe comes from\nIf our universe can be shown to be a reasonably probable outcome of what they called the quantum wave equation or the quite ... corn way function\nThen they think they will have explained the universe but one of them are a student proponents of\nQuantum cosmology Alexander ... said well wait a minute math we were saying that math is basically producing material universe but he says math\nIs something that exist in a mind are we therefore saying that all the material universe there's actually a mind\nAnd that's not a very congenial a conclusion because it's basically a materialistic Lee inspired cosmology the other thing that's really strange is that in order to solve the equation that gives you a universal wave function out of which our universe might be a reasonably probable outcome\nThe the the a theoretical physicist has to impose were called boundary constraints on the degrees of mathematical freedom of this equation which is actually imparting information into the math\nTo get the outcome they want so they're actually modeling the need an unexplained infusion of information to get to universal even if you get mad or out of math\nYou you still can't get the information needed to produce the universe for the anyway you can't get around a man in the beginning was the word\nSo go on on the big bang yeah yeah so there's there's a number of these materialistic cosmology that are trying to circumvent\nThe clear an obvious implication of the big bang which is that the universe ... the material universe the physical universe had a death in the beginning in time space matter and energy hawking in ten rows approve this with something called the singularity there I'm In the late sixties there's been an additional proof of this called the board goose Lincoln tear him\nAnd the citizens and cosmologists have been going crazy trying to ... should try to find a way to circumvent this conclusion hawking himself worked on circumventing his own proof\nBut he was the originator of this cosmological idea that crosses popularized\nBut it doesn't really work for the reasons I've specified and then there's another version of this where they want a it's called the inflationary cosmology were have one big bang after another big bang after another big bang it was mainly designed to circumvent the problem of the fine tuning of the universe but what what are the odds\nA irony of that whole effort is that the mechanism by which you would get the multiple big banks itself has to be ... exquisitely fine tuned to tend to the\nAnyway there's no evidence for and there's no evidence is you're entirely speculative cosmological models ... that in the multi verse or for greater leaps of faith and we do believe in God\nRight I gave a talk on this the other night here in Southern California and I remember the thing from Alice in wonderland says six impossible things before breakfast to do well the the the the these natural cosmology force you to posit multiple eggs are\nAbstract explanatory entities influence on field ... shut up energy strings multi dimensions of space to explain the very long lived one God would explode and you'll be\nWithin a Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio [noise]\nThat is pretty good here for ... at the American federal rare coin and bullying for years I've been recommending precious metal dealers\nBut I wasn't sure where to turn what I wanted to make a change their mind your own portfolio strategy so I reached out to my good friend Michael ... he's been personally working with ... at American federal for\nYears and I couldn't be happier with Michael's recommendation I was able to speak and work directly with American federals owner ...

nation on God's green earth a great day to consider\nJust how out of touch a lot of the leading\nLights in the Democratic party really are one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nJust think about this for a moment\nOr Elizabeth Warren shows\nTo be in the news [noise]\nAnd to be in the news regarding the results of her DNA tests\nWhich no we're not administered by President Trump I don't even know what that means [noise]\nBut uh the DNA test that she\nUnderwent that showed that she may be\nOne out of one thousand and twenty fourth\nOr as much as one out of sixty fourth a Native American\nNo really ... by the way let's take the best case analysis based upon the DNA tests and everyone should understand that that no one can except these DNA tests because very often they've shown that different companies do different tests and they come out with wildly different results that's even why Elizabeth Warren\nHad several different tests taken here and all of them show like most Americans the overwhelming majority of the European Americans and by the way also the over ... well Ming majority of African Americans there is a little bit of Native American and most people whose families have lived here in the United states for many years and that is true for Elizabeth Warren's family\nBut the best case analysis for her the idea that she is one sixty fourth Native American means that about a hundred and fifty years ago she had one of her sixty four\nGreat great great great grandparents who may have been Cherokee\nAs she says family lore suggested the entire thing ... was a ridiculous claim to begin with and\nWouldn't it be better for her she just backed off of it no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be was she thinking why is this a good idea\nIt makes her look ridiculous and make sure looked like a liberal racist why do I say that\nBecause for goodness sake if you grow up in a situation where you never affiliate with a tribe no one in your whole family within memory is ever affiliated with the tribe you've never gone to Indian events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian history or background\nYou have no connection no affiliation no participation know communal involvement with the\nNative American community and ah then when you get hired at Penn at Harvard you put down that your ethnicity is Native American because that qualifies you as a diversity hire\nI mean the whole thing is sad now is it\nThe end of the world no it's not the end of the world but she is making at the end of her campaign she is blowing herself up and she chose to do this thing this would be a good idea or does she really saying she should get the million dollars that President Trump by the way did not promise here is what that is\nBased on where a that's number three they're under Warren audio Jeremy where where President Trump makes the original offer to Senator Warren he's doing a rally in Montana or over the summer listen I Want\nIf you take the test of the shows your your [noise]\nOkay [noise] and it shows you are an Indian right but the uh the that whole idea\nShows urine Indian means that you would be accepted by some kind of try and there is no time in the country that will accept someone with one sixty fourth Indian blood as an Indian and they do require you to be an enrolled member of any tried to actually show that yes you have a personal history\nThat has involved you or someone in your family or someone in your background\nShe has none of that and so she can't\nCollect the million dollars in the wall Street Journal is wrong and that the um the wall Street Journal and they should tell you what their editorials said and why I think they are wrong and seriously wrong about this it's bad or they basically suggests that Trump would look good if he just paid or the money\nAnd I'm here here's what the what they say in a their editorial they say write the check Donald you'll look gracious and you'll have amusing talking points photograph it will last the entire two thousand twenty campaign\nShe says I'm miss Warren now says Mr Trump should make good on his opposed to write a million dollar check to charity of ms Warren proved she had Native American blood he\nDidn't say she had to prove she has a Native American a bloody said she had to show she was an Indian and venture and if he doesn't do this he's ... what you call in and give her right [laughter] or an Indian better\nI'm as Lindsey Graham actually spoke on this he was willing to uh he's going forward with his own DNA tests and he's going to out Native American Elizabeth Warren here's what Senator Graham had to say\nWas before and if she could be anywhere from one sixty fourth to one thousand Native American you have a challenge I'm going to take a day and it just all of you have I've been told him our grandmother worth far Cherokee Indian it may all be just talk\nBut you got to find out in a couple of weeks 'cause I'm going to take this new or going to take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be revealed here this is my truck moment Mrs Allen and say why are you and I just I'm dying to know why you know I didn't really think much about it because she's less than one tenth of one percent I\nThink I can beat her I think I can beat her to ... us for a million dollars from the president to not want a casino enemy about\nOkay he wants a casino and a million bucks a I good luck with that Lindsey or by the way you can you imagine how are the headlines and some of the more left leaning papers was South Carolina senator says he wants to beat\nHis colleague from Massachusetts\nAre abusing woman again really ... by the way it does this have anything at all to do with feminism are hashtags may too if you think it does you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six looks at one thing that a Senator Warren I think is ... is a\nA really bringing Americans together and a news busters put together a collage showing of the way that major networks including some that are usually reliably liberal reacted to this Elizabeth Warren ploy\nThe Cherokee Nation criticized foreigners announcement saying that are you sort of DNA tests is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nPiano without washing whether that's revelation really they'd ... any point for ... this is the reason it's controversial when she was at Harvard law school and when she was at the University of Pennsylvania she represented herself as Native American shape contributed to a Native American cookbook called powwow challenge [laughter]\nCherokee\nThe Cherokee Nation called the president's attacks interested but it's also criticizing Warren thing she is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage adding a DNA tests any useless current DNA tests do not even thing which whether a person the ancestors were indigenous to North or South America in the video warns\nThat she respects the difference between family history and tribal affiliation\nNot enrolled in and try and only drawn to determine tribal citizenship and [laughter] oh boy\nOh boy is right I mean really what was Elizabeth Warren thinking and what is her side of this\nIs their side of it is not that I see a there was a um Cherokee Nation as secretary of state and yes it is a separate nation officially ah was on CNN with Jake Tapper and she'll costs can junior had this to say\nThe problem with the DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation a member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best I can give you some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have lived there in North and South American maybe in a native peoples of those continents\nI'm irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country that that's the base that's based on a legal definition certainly every tribe has that in common that we have some legal basis for citizenship that we determined consistent with federal trainees\nJust totally unhelpful for any national later to cling to DNA to determine the or to the tablets at their Native American in this country\nAnd by the way it doesn't really established require DNA there is a very famous American and he's a featured character in my book the American miracle name Sam Houston\nAnd Sam Houston was an official member of the Cherokee tribe why not because\nHe was born that way but because he went and they live with the Cherokees and he worked with them and he was adopted by a local chief and he learned the language and he was deeply involved themselves a Senator Warren and your for your time after you lose your presidential race\nIt that's not his motivation and it's not about he cares about her misappropriating culture have just acting badly and making racist attacks\nIt why is it a racist attack\nI don't see that I don't get I think it's an attack on a political opponent and yes the president does a lot of it um\n[noise] let's uh go to Pam and try cities Washington Pam you're on the Michael ...\nMichael who am I I feel that I used to love your show but you become just like the other right wing radio host that now down in worship Trump and um [noise] well well I'm\nAgainst say it's okay if he does is he didn't really mean that he he no way I think it's cute he doesn't lie he misspelled way way way life now hold on how wide\nPam I I Will say that President Trump has told outright lives things that he knows not to be true because he's been told but where is there an outright lie here on this issue\n[noise] I you know and he said find out if you have I don't know exactly what he said\nLet me play ... he had he oh what's her that million dollars less than I Am wanted\nLet me let me play it for you okay I just want to be fair here listen to what President Trump\nSaid here's President Trump's original offered over Elizabeth Warren\nIf you take the test of the shows your your [noise]\nOkay is it shows you're an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world and the country\nWould accept her as an Indian based upon this DNA test that shows that she may have had one great great great great grandfather who was in India that's my only point\nJust want to say that I'm from ... in your color and uh and the previous hour said Trump that brought us down to the gutter he really has and I mean you guys I I'm just so an age limit you\nLet me ask you this okay do you think that\nIs honorable or for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] you know I don't think she should have done that I look at it it was trivial and she shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what Trump calls out women he called and he said Dr forward it doesn't matter and she was lying or not we want and what do you want it that's all he cares about winning and he doesn't care who he dumped on\nOkay look I I Believe that President Trump does sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate in the Senate already on the show\nI I think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who has made accusations of a intimate kind against him\nTwo attackers horse face at who put that in a tweet today\nUm it's probably we probably reached a point in our world where ... ... if you're going to be attacking a female and he can attack or the way President Trump is attacking was with warm but don't attack or looks I think we can agree on that and Pam I appreciate your calling\nMe and carrying enough about the show to actually call even with a complaint\n[noise] the point is that the fact that a Trump [noise] ah ah can ah\nOccasionally makes mistakes I Would never say he can do no wrong but it's wrong to say he can do no rice we will be right back on the show\n[noise] you're listening eligible nice sixty debate [noise]\nNice sixteen\nOriole call the number of confirmed deaths
