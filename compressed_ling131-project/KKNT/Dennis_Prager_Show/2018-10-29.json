R. at AOL dot com [noise]\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer for as I did for Larry Elder last friday [laughter]\nIt was already can continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I wanted to talk to about illegal immigration especially with the caravan approaching I've talked about illegal immigration\nFor over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge of the simple fact\nThat people who cross the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out which one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone the illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as famous place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal then they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you own a home and if someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walks into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is Eric out if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove that the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented\nAs if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said that the left has won the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change or whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit of course and helps to have a media on your side perpetuating these false it's so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the obvious\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work and President Trump and Republicans accused you heard President Obama last hour we had the clip of him of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in cold cages\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration [noise]\nHe has more I mean but would be the right word than anybody I Know President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes but the left the Democrats in the media all from the same thing I Do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believed in open borders but they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms never mind that want anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail they'll their children do not go with them to jail they're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd it all in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nDallas no doubt in my my name is Thirteen and other people who do us harm or among them so again President Trump to Republicans will be on the defense of just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show you crying children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets into our country or a house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right to protect the American people from armed with a from terrorism or as one caller mentioned last hour disease or even for that matter to make sure that people who come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico\nSome of us exist as so obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense I mention it last hour the Democrats won more votes and the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know it\nSo you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of Hispanics old when he ran in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA loss in politics or sixty to forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption most of the ... illegal immigrants coming for jobs as we'd long established but they also take advantage of government handouts that the rest of us are paying for and the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering better give it up\nSo here's a phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats they always choose the real thing\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even even on a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it is clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody [noise]\nWhat do you say to people around the world who've been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and in ... and she bought a national paperwork even have a chance of getting here so they have to follow the rules but those are dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one call a lot of different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nBut even if that were true I told him I bet they work in the short run to stop mass of people coming here don't you wish we had a border now as we will are going to be confronted with these people in short time not to mention these really live safe for murder by their fence\nWe need we need to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming into our country and I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed onto barrel publications like Bush George W. Bush for Paul Ryan\nNo amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior but today to those who say the border wall well work\nThey use the same are addicted logic I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had at the end of last summer when they say the documents commit oh he said the caller a chance for me to have they committed mass murder no it's not like the argument or have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans\nWho cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt your fat illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that wall preventing one Hamas murderer in Israel for mentoring would have said that Israelis life\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals are given safe harbor\nYou come up with phony arguments like illegals will not cooperating with the authorities you've heard this if they know they can be apprehended are sent home\nBut how about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with the Saudis how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes than native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers in ice who had the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes some of the rest of us have to live with long waists of hospitals deteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nSo what's my solution I said I Would give it to you take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you force strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some see CEOs to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would stay for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake please enough of the government sending out the wrong message with bilingual education classes or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by its language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our values\nWell the reality is is that work on the air for jobs\nIn order to find a job\nThey gotta fill out an informant and when they do that and say they are here legally that commit perjury which is a felony or the other thing is is that they routinely make up Social Security numbers or single somewhat the Social Security numbers are set up for Immigration Studies suggest that\nAbout Seventy five percent of the illegal aliens that are here to work [noise] uh had been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a myth my daughter was actually a victim of a\n... by illegal aliens using her Social Security number which were stolen which was a child [laughter] so uh I don't know why the conservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing\nA by by describing what's happening here is entirely when people come here to work [noise]\nYeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that house someone gets into a country we call the legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to the people you want to give the opportunity to [noise]\nHe seems so obvious to me and that's why you have to have the when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states of Murphy illegal immigrants but you changed language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nUp actually taking my call mark I think it's one thing that's changed a big lost all I mean if you're like this caravan of course they want they want they either\nPathway contented only ... the out a solid dog Guatemala decent people what's lost in those countries that pose country just gangs and and search team or what you want to tell\nYou all know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that that they're going to be terrorists among them the going to be people that don't value the ideal so we do in the United states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been said and as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing this some orderly process that's the whole point\nHis argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do it here the rules here the procedures you have to follow them ... President Trump's Republicans are going to lose this one either way right do you call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joins in with that trait\nAnd if you uh do stop them you have an invasion you have people coming into these people aren't coming in for some that maybe some of them\nBut a lot of them we know they're ...

helpful to grow up and down\nOn people and frankly among among the press says well\nOkay I I think he's entirely right the one thing that I Would be careful of Mr Weiss respectfully don't compare Louis Farrakhan the Donald Trump I mean those are gone is an open unapologetic lifelong anti Semite\nHe is that meaning he he clearly is he doesn't even apologize for it anymore and uh he he is identified I don't know anyone\nWho can plausibly say that Louis Farrakhan is not a hater of Jewish people\nAnd Donald Trump is so free of that charge you can charge Trump with lots and lots of stuff but I I tweeted about this it is unequivocal that Donald Trump cares deeply about the state of Israel\nAnd as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said today he adores his Jewish grandchildren\nAnd the idea that the Donald Trump is quote dog whistling or is is some kind of deep anti Semite or that he's responsible for encouraging things like this synagogue attack by as little wife said a guy who said he hated
