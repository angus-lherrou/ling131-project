refuses to stand for the anthem as long held a grudge against Jenkins for his role and redirecting some of the protest energy into more direct action via a deal with the players coalition which Jenkins cofounded\nJenkins who endorses the cause behind the protests agreed to stop the on field protests if the league would invest about a hundred million dollars into quote unquote social justice causes\nFor that read has labeled Jenkins a sellout\nAs the two teams went out on the field before the game Sunday reading Jenkins began to draw a moment caught on camera things got tense enough that reads teammates have to restrain him\nKaepernick quickly chimed in to express his support\nFor Eric read them after the game read made clear to reporters why he has so much animosity for a fellow NFL player who actually agrees with the larger cause\nJenkins he said as a sellout and I Neal colonialist because he co-opted the movement by working with the league to raise money for social justice rather than continuing to protest on the field by the way this proves that guys are like read\nA low with this country\nHe would rather crap on the flag publicly in front of millions then have a

hour I raised in a an interesting question\nAnd now that you can call in I can pursue it I had this experience with my wife was shopping for a few of the first time I've always just driven a car and anyway shopping from SUV and I are very rarely shop for cars because\nFor much of my the last decade side in driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they sold their businesses in any way shape or whatever it is it now as we're having a new experience to haven't had in a while ago in a car dealers him I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with all your Internet I Want to know what to do with the you know with car dealers [noise]\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's about an issue there almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance real foggy for things for four or five the five were young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean ... any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment\nI'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is it all representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but it's it is an oil representative\n\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that is you can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the lines of the of the SUV versus the other ones it's like ... all I could always look it up on the other is in general knowledge or may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know what he's saying if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pockets and find out you need to know\n\nThis is now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do a very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I Am trusting of at the lines are working on a ... seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nThat was a that was one\nAspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even deeper\nThan that is that the\nThere was a there seems to be an absence of passion I again I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales\nFolks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession I didn't have that sense from any of these are salespeople again all the young I didn't have any sense of or if they were passionate about cars\nThat was it was they might as well I've been working at a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people I'm not ... not a character challenge it's just a statement of a change that\nYou know if you haven't seen anybody you know in the law you ever seen a young person in the long term wow boy did you grow you really groom because you haven't seen them so you see if you haven't seen something in a long time you can see a change\nSo this was a change that we saw a gentleman who you are just so many folks are statistical question our our launch working is what is your story shoulder you know\nOkay anyway ah\nWhat was we'll find out\nOh they're not working you know what I'm Sorry folks like giving you rolling information I was given the information\nBut the lines are up about okay these are unfortunate things that I must admit annoying me but you know live with it and you got to live with it and that's the way it works\nThat's what I saw though there was it was in it and and then I translated that into as well\nThey didn't seem you can sense it\nIn in young people specifically addressing men whether it's a very ambitious or enough and I wonder too if in this generation but we have in some ways it created a less ambitious\nYoung male or have theories on that but let me go now to my guess mine would be looking forward to talking to John from Iraq senior editor of the stream the come off or\nThe excellent politically correct guy to immigration and John

I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgrace totally turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist\nSongs and talking about how they're going to transform English us in the U.S in Germany damage I mean that the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees in Germany with the German American button you know\nUm these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're they're just living in kinda crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason\nUh for historical and cultural and political reasons that 'cause they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad dictatorial political culture from Spain\nUh whereas we inherited a kind of an anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and as a result they have been worse government worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great\nLatin American economists her and her and I think his name I turn on the court a ... I think it's ...\nSoto was found out\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from drug lords\nLatin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence\nOf it they were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people they they come in and start working their kids will grow up properly I public assistance\nLarge percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a honey pot full of benefits from the government and you know why the Catholic my own Catholic churches so gung ho about this refugee armada [noise]\nForty percent of the U.S Catholic bishops income comes from the U.S government\nFrom programs to serve immigrants forty percent is government contracts and one out of four five Catholics in America is now an immigrant mostly from Latin America because our bishops had been walling in these scandals\nAnd running gait bath house is labeled a seminary so one out of five to four American Catholics has left the church\nI'm Sorry not one at a four four and a cat for Catholics born in America can leave the church and the only way to replace them without reforming the church is to bring in more cannon fodder for Latin America which also brings in hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government\nYou are made a point to me last time and it it it just shook me up because it makes so much sense if you can feel the church with Americans you have to bring in none of Americans\nWho will last or maybe ten or Twenty years and then they'll get disgusted and they will join a Protestant Church because they don't want to have get bishops bug ... seminarians they don't want to have the way she is that many priests who have boyfriends they they don't want the child abuse running or emphysema [noise]\nIf ... if somebody bags on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room\nYou have a right to shut the door and use whatever forces are required\nTo stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact

you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash you know trash cans with the fire\nIs that the future of America\nTo me politically this is gonna happen\nPresumably right before the incredibly important congressional elections right and I I I I worry given the ... the media\nThat we will just have video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice personal border guards\nAre pushing some mom with a baby and then uh it's it's it seems to me the when the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets that George Soros funded attorney\nYou know that's not to forgive me job that's not the propaganda war that's winning the war I agree but the propaganda war you know me\nI I think one of those ... let me let me just breaking point\nIt seems to me that they win if they get in and the women so you don't get it and I don't\nBecause if they are good I Hope you're right there's no science I you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness\nIf he caves then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying so we realized the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIt it's even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nLine I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I think if he got dance farm if he's yes if you have to learn\nThat that will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fight between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out\nFor it toward otherwise going to turn out this is a

of weeks ago and we got a tremendous response most people were very positive and actually talked about how his experience mirrored their own [noise]\nThe whole theme of his piece was he's a middle aged stay at home dad he's also\nThe greatest living American writer how do I know that because it says right on his website and uh he certainly did do a great job writing that particular column or Neal Pollack it's great to meet you over the phone\nThat hey Michael how are you\nHey I'm doing well I um [noise] I I ... I\nJust wanted to ask you they at the outset eat your piece was actually scary and sad and very honest\nAnd how long how many years did you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it\nSo a long time how do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm sober I can look back on some of the uh who might be have years when I was high and and realize that uh\nThat pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public meltdown even temper tantrums even uh getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also wasn't sleeping normally\nI I was I was kind of ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time thinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume and about the consumers with about trips I could take that would revolve around marijuana and you know it just kind of became\nThe center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you you've been married for a while Ryan\nHas been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I mean I published a capitalist ten bucks I had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for\nYou know pretty much every English language publication except for the New Yorker you know I'd say that it's not like I [noise] I was a um an on ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I I certainly would have a you know live my life with more integrity and getting carried out my ah my business affairs with we made it more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nHow long how long have you been sober\nA my one year anniversary is November left so I'm going to make it I'm pretty sure that I relapsed at them coming before that so I'll just say a year\nOkay well good for you congratulations on that and what\nAdvantages do you see now that your non smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of oracle to want to buy because in some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote almost all my books by all the time and I I Can't although in retrospect there there's a law that there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting hot\nAnd I I think there will be fewer of those but you know I it it it helped me come up with certain flights fancy indeed some jokes\nAre ... and it was a creative stimulant in some ways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends um I'm Better organized um I I I Can't say I'm making more money but I feel like why life is in order professionally in a way that at work which is not as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nWithout it's happening when I was using marijuana you know I'm not I'm not super up all the time and and then when I when I bought 'em out I don't bottom out there's there's no there's no high or low it was like I said so I'm not having the melt down that would characterize a sort of my my addiction cycle\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... speaking with Neal Pollack who wrote about how marijuana almost ruined his life yeah one thing you you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years\nDoes your wife ever share a your enthusiasm for ah read\nNo and in fact you know she was just the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive ... in some ways\nIt's considered a health food um and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism in my family um and obviously had the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me\nUm maybe it should have you know they've always ducking behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym so he you know take a hit so it'd be high wall of working out there that's not the signs of someone who is necessarily healthy but uh you know I just\nI ah I didn't see it she did and she she was so grateful when I finally made the decision to quit\nYou know I ... you use the figures in your in your piece that I I I think they're generally accepted to you from the journal of the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that uh some nine percent of people\nWhoever use marijuana end up getting addicted\nAnd Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers did you first used to wait as a teenager\nI smoked once at a party when I was in high school but you know when I was when I was a teenager and this was you know the Nineteen eighties I was I was sort of a\nGo getter do gooder student council type sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on you know Michael J. Fox is character from Family Guy that was my model like I wouldn't go ... I was going to be successful I was going to be as great American citizens and\nUm and so part didn't really play into it um you know in college I kind of um\nI I went a little uh [noise] I I I'm a member of generation X. and so I you know I I I became kind of a a grouchy pop culture sitting there but I still was doing a lot of drugs or it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I said I really started a consuming it\nSo it was an adult onset addiction\nRain rain I view I'm ever tried to calculate how much money you invested in and buying lead over the years so\nOh I mean it was probably a few thousand dollars you know the the thing is it and you know and and this is a brag it's just a fact you know I there was a time there were I was a ... you know well known writer and people would just give me drugs or or smoke me up and I I'm I'm kind of some\nInherently cheap so I Would look for situation to where I ... I knew I'd be around people who would have it so I wouldn't have to buy but of course I still would sometimes you know when I Lived in LA I had a medical marijuana card out here I drove to Colorado for a week and it's been a hundred two hundred bucks so it didn't bankrupt me in that sense but\nIt you know it's still it was still even on a month where it was really good at ... still caught me at least fifty dollars about a hundred bucks\nAnd I know you you you've written a since you've written this ... sentence obviously\nCausing a graced or have you done so negative reaction from some of your old friends\nAlthough people have been very supportive I got a few people in wonderful go\nYeah I mean generally when someone announces that they're an addict the reaction is that like your baking it or [laughter]\nYou know you're ... it's not you know or or you're not an addict I mean if you have you gone through what if you go through the twelve step program guided there's no way you can know anyone could say that you're not an addict I mean I wouldn't have done it if I was it but uh\nCharacter flaws and then you try to fill the gaps with whatever the addictive substances and he mentioned do a whole list of them yeah alcohol drugs gambling sex eating shopping list goes on and off so yeah I mean that's an absolutely accurate a\nStatement and I I don't think anyone who's ever um\nSuffer from addiction would would disagree with that\nLet's go to Steve in Louisville, Kentucky Steve you're on the show was Neal Pollack\nWell Michael thanks for having me on so new and just listening to talk it seems like we live a very weird life just just in different places um I kind of wonder how many people were out there like us I'm certainly the years\nOf consumption of marijuana for all I can ... the um you know ... has it affected you know you mentioned it seemed like you were a little conflict is\nHas to in order to help your wife or ...\nFor me you know I didn't have or avoid that I was trying to feel a little uh marijuana we just kind of stumbled across to each other but certainly the creative aspect that may be a little bit more on the artistic side of the visual side\nI feel that it's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question was what the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah that's a good question and to address the thing you were saying it's like it's just marijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm\nYou know heroin where you're ... if you get addicted very fast I'm In Philly you can use it for a number of years that's sort of a low level is gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity can act of ironically enough\nThat the Dodgers are back in the world series that actually came at the world series I ... I went to Los Angeles because I'd always dreamed of going all World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it\nAnd I bought a ticket off of some fraudulent third party Web site before I did that I managed to get as high as I possibly could um even though you know there's no reason why you need to get hired and go to the world series but I needed to get hired and do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high\nUm smoking the huge joined it had all this crystallized th ... all over and then I moved from smoking weed with a stranger in in his house in echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally I started screaming at people and I was almost got arrested I got it scored it\nOut of the stadium or by security guards I was in the parking lot sobbing and I just kind of took a look at myself into a side view mirror of a car and I just saw this old man with red rimmed eyes\nCrying but we're a baseball game and I just I thought to myself this isn't good I Can't go on like this and so I didn't quit that day but three weeks later I got a ... and I just took my left off and\nKen Daniel more around haven't voted can can you be around other people who were getting high or use our would you go into the
