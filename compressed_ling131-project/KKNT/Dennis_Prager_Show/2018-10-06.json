I was wondering if he's got a vehicle that are led here it's got to have you with a rare for a Honda here you know how ... and if they were looking for a law and his or her\nAnd looking at trade in or sell her lived at the that was the second part of my life so that both the first part what do you think about what do you recommend it for the small acutely that reliable that\nOkay alright alright where am I doing it on the table or the sums up or thumbs down on the raft for\nAnd many of her I I mean in Eric's given the summers up its mediocre for the three yeah okay so let's go on all four of them the C R B ... salaries a little higher than there are ... are are we just neutral on the sea RV or we sums up on the theory\n[noise] people that own them love them and they only thing is they tend to be under powered cars they only come all the four cylinder okay All right now how about the ... Santa Fe I really like yeah yeah they have to be six they have a lot more power uh\nThe only problem we're finding ... on the hunt dies as we've had a lot of sludge problems and stuff and selling them engines and the GED eyes have some issues but that's going to be able to board water brand Judy I means grass gas directed injection or\nHow current problems fried rice card and we'll get to that somewhere down the road and then I Want to throw it out there as well and you guys had validate the turtles [laughter]\nYou guys [laughter]\nI'm get I'll get even get you guys are going to beat me up on this but why not like the forward edge\nFor that day that that was that on the back burner and it is there anything else that I Am in a\nWhile and his size range she's talking they've got the escape route I happen to like the escape better than any of the three he mentioned okay you didn't hear me say that\nThat's fine that's fine you know he's got to throw you want to chime in if ... recalls [laughter]\nYou're gonna\nHave to shut these guys are going to be there because this is going to make it easier for me my wife you know drives and hatch she bought it without my permission\nFor my family has owned in a in a million years yeah but I got out here\nThe ... it's a ... it's the V. six so um I I I got to drive their cars she's in Italy and I drove it up and down around two or three times she's got eighty eight thousand miles on a four year old car so she's been put some miles on it and I still like to drive it yeah I still while the amenities I like to drive I also like to hunt and I started on both of those thumbs up here\nI'm not Eric sided about the sea RV and the rap for fear of bees are are so under powered that's a problem\nIf you put for all the blood and had to pay someone for Hugo time and it's a hundred degree a hundred and Fifteen air day you're standing in a\nWhile and you're going to be crawling up the hill\nAnd I I like the forward edge and I'll tell you this much they have the edge basics then they got the terrible yeah All right there was two guys that I Know [laughter] I decided to see who could out run who so they went to the bottom of the human rye\nSo they were going to go up to four and a half miles up the pace and this is their story we were neck and neck of the entire way\nSo I couldn't pass him and he couldn't pass me so the four cylinder Chernobyl against the V. six edge it was kind of a draw so I thought I heard I don't\n... [laughter] story [laughter] that was a couple\nOf guys I Know yeah I already but anyway I'm Sal here's the real good advice how many years have you been married\nA rational ... will be thirty\nOkay All right I think you're smart enough to know that it doesn't make any difference what four guys on the radio [laughter] if I were you here's my best advice let her pick question [laughter]\nYou'll pick it for and it turns out to be a big turn to you and us beyond that do not provide certainly dinner limited\nAt got sick and\nParts that are collecting with everybody that bite me I guess doing we were going to trade in her mind that three which has been running fine up to now last week it happened I got a mall league and the radiator care and that didn't do its job they quoted me a\nSix to six or seven hundred dollars to replace it I don't want to replace it 'cause I'm getting ready to buy your car or a small SUV though I think about putting them stop a leak in the radiator and everybody told me that the terrible idea but I'm not going to him that car very law\nOkay we put stop licking traded in 'cause they'll picked up on that I mean that's that's going to be an easy to pick it up and then they're going to do value of the car\nI think depending on the little Blue Book value of that that you ought to put a rave theater yeah yeah I think you put the radio or energy how you spend eighty dollars have a detailed put it on the ... put it on the on Craig's list I think\nThat you should be able to little three ringed notebook with all your maintenance records and that shows that you're an old guy in that shows that you're an all have that shows that Iran ... heads [laughter]\nBut people yeah people loved those cars so you only have two choices we got three choices traded in a way it is ... ... you're going to obviously you're going to make your six hundred back in a heartbeat\nUm and I think just six hundred might have upper and lower hoses and that sounds about aspect or if you're over heated a thermostat or something okay yeah so I say has more to the radiator I think there's no coolest I think there might be effort or hoses and I think the radiator and I think you're going to get your money back on trade and\nGoing to buy that part I Know we're going to go to a different brand and so that now I'm going to step out and say that the three whisker kid sells parts that are not up to the level that I Want to install\nMy my monthly parts bill is easy forty thousand thirty forty thousand dollars and the three whisker kid might get\n'em my total bill there might be fifty two hundred dollars 'cause he have a a baby moon kept kept by need or a can of paint ... bluff you always want the ... yeah yeah [laughter] so I mean we we'll we'll do that but um there is a difference in parts yes they're they're just is a difference\nAnd and I think the difference is there's twenty five percent of the parks out there or the ... just junk\nAnd then there are Seventy five percent is the kind that we all ... you're not going to pick move suspension I might like moving you might like somebody else for an Emmy and I might like a continental belts and you like Goodyear belts whatever his name but the idea is is pretty much that [noise]\nUm we talked with John about his for TPS and now we described the procedure it's kind of technical so he's probably going to need some help but but I don't know that I'd get a third TPS right now I get upset and see if it's if it's available to be set\nAnd then move on from there because how long will it take you to determine that the TPS isn't working like it should\nWhat can you do that in twenty minutes yeah okay and I could too I think I could look over your shoulder\nThat I Do that from here I'm going to talk about you guys as um and and I know this because somebody else sent it to me\nThere was someone who came into your shop\nAnd he had a Ninety nine for Mustang\nDon't correct me I'm working on this by myself as a Ninety nine Ford Mustang and he has a ticket from another repair shop that has a Seventy four hundred dollar estimate\nThat says replace the engine replace ray to replace the coolant censor clean out the offer inside the tank replace the heater hoses evacuating recharge air conditioning and um there's some miscellaneous parts that we have an added to the estimate Seventy four hundred dollars\n[noise] I have it on good authority that you guys to fix this car\nThree hundred you remember this car it's a must yeah you remember the car [laughter] okay so I don't know what color it is but it's a Mustang and it's a Ninety nine okay if you remember it yes it is okay what was the bill\nThat forcing their parents probably about three hundred bucks okay and he's got some other stuff to the little additional once it covers running fine who drove it\nTo make sure that we could go ten twenty thirty miles high there Mr Kurt himself okay and so basically\nIt didn't need an engine that didn't need ... radiator\nIt didn't eat coolant or was cool and part of the repair we did ... what was wrong with it\nHad blown bypass host okay so you put a bypass those on it flushed it out uh-huh what else we did some additional repairs that weren't we didn't do the radiator but not because it was the problem just because the cooling system had gotten old and that was one of the reason I was busted okay but that wasn't\nNeeded to actually make it running okay All right so was the ticket with the raiders still three hundred or a little more than that you know if you're out of the other four hundred and five hundred six hundred [laughter] we we want to do in door handles and everything else more however you know I don't I don't know ... ...\n... if it's three hundred like I'm guessing the radiator on top of that probably hoses and stuff for two or three hundred dollars so I'm going to say six hundred bucks forget the door handles yeah okay\nSo that's why folks that the shops that are on my best car repair shops list that's why we're good is because we have a conscious we know what's right and wrong and we're not going to be an engineer radiator coolant reservoir all the hoses clean this claim that evacuating recharge air conditioning for Seventy four hundred dollars\nA year and I'm not particularly one that looked like somebody from the other shot but actually dumped oil and the top of the reader to cover themselves when the customer decided to pull it out of their shop so oil crossing over into the\nCooling system typically means engine problems and probably had gas disarray and take basket right okay so after you're done you'll know if it comes back with oil and ... and you're going to have to eat some crow on the other hand you up that's what you thought so you clean that out and they should be fine yeah but\nOkay well they they got the oil and the outside of the cat that got to do a better job of covering their own so [laughter]\nSo it's on the outside of the inside inside and outside so that they ...\nThey get\nTheir little sloppy so I'm not going to name them shop but um anyway Kurtz Otto is a place and and you've done that for I'm looking at you curtail you've done that that's how we really got together is the lady with the motor and you put an oil pressures which ended after she had been bit by three other shops that are motor decay\nThat's that's what we do um I I think all all my shops have that happened but this one was brought to me okay let's go to the phones and let's see what we can do and as soon as I get the paper out Jim Jim good morning to you how can we help yeah\nGood morning work well I have a question I'm I'm calling on behalf of my son who revealed his grandfather's Nineteen Seventy six Chevy ... of Silverado K n hear the question with tiny ... he took it into a shop\nThat the uh the landing and apparently a buck forty three degrees from it now it's running love and\nCats are now saying that they need a recruiter spring kept\nUh we're wondering if that's something we should do it's a a three fifty small block engine he hasn't ... under the FM carburetor in the Chevy performance each I distributor\nOkay All right well we like the distributor right yeah okay I may ask some questions\nUm is forty three degrees is it going to run at forty three degrees well let's hope they're talking about a maximum of ban set rpm already here forty three at idol or are you measure and on high rpm that that\nHigh opium okay yeah that sounds normal ... maybe ... thirty eight is where I where the U.S led anything about thirty eight no no no nothing about being an okay because we went too far on the top and we'd have men Rio okay so and I go ahead\nOh so it wasn't he went to the proper things many robot away from the shop we went right back they bought it that way\n[laughter] All right I'm here here's I mean gosh guys ... I'm going to go this myself I don't need your help on this [laughter]\nIt's like you know it is to take the distributor cap off and grab a hold of the road and rocket left and right and if it springs back and it's loose then we're we're sat on the mechanical side that we take a vacuum dumping grab a hold of the stupid nip along the vacuum a advance and pump it ... and we can see the base played move left and right we're done [laughter]\nYeah we're done [laughter] and so you're going to ... now I'm gonna I'm gonna I gotten a number\nOf my head give me a wild guess on the timing that idle\nTime at idle should be up uh somewhere around\nEight to ten degrees I'm with you I'm holding it behind the computer screen what's my fingers that have the thing is he's run an adult Brock he's running and so any of that fact respects don't come into play now but here's the deal\nWe certainly are going to retard the no no no we're not going to go retarded high performance in her car battery our eyes fry it and we're not going to advance the timing because of this high performance because we do set of the curb and then it's got that strictly and let it go where it\nWas yeah that is why it's a little higher than you would expect 'cause it's a performance distributed and that'll be fine but it ain't going to start at forty three degree you know so so you know I I just\nWe don't agree based on looking at it through your eyes gym we don't agree that okay not fancy a distributor is the answer unless these track or something if you're just drive in it\nYeah and ... out there being a jerk going around the hours with tobacco wheel spin like Eric and Jeff do and everybody else is a jerk but not that I'm sitting there at dogs do something like that this morning did you really\nAnd here it was only one tenth yeah a mark I didn't say nothing okay that's good [laughter]\nI'm Jim I I I don't think I think we made ourselves clear we don't agree with the diagnosis because there's too many holes symptoms because the reason we can say we don't agree is because you're given us information assuming the and puts his good the output is good and I don't know how many years years how many years you've got\nWhoa I started at Seventeen marriage All right so a lot of an add it up I Can't do math I what what is it you muted him oh I'm\nSorry sorry has been working to curse just over twenty okay you I'm just under twenty I'm at forty I'm gonna give you forgive me for the only thing we got two hundred and Twenty years of ... three times more times four times twenty no forty forty eight\nHundred a hundred and twenty five hundred Twenty years of experience here and we're we're all solid in our our responses that you don't have um ... if it if it has a problem with the springs or the vacuum or the mechanical he wouldn't have any power to correct he wouldn't have any ...\nAnd ... and if it was hanging up than it would be hard starting with dragged to start or so\nGo more oh like Ford stew [laughter]\nThey\nDon't have that you don't have this stuff for health care right very good thing at a much more negative Donald you betcha six oh two five await zero nine sixty six to ... we're not going to be Jeff but if you call us we're just haven't found that everybody's expands yeah but I don't know anything about a red truck [laughter]\nYou know what we don't want to get in a mess with me I'm All right you don't want to do that because you're not here every week [laughter]\nA cell phone [laughter]\nI was going to sound\nAnd they are the other day a guy came in and he showed me pay more to thirty thousand I'm not going to say who it is because the good of been an independent shop thirty thousand dollars for\nThat that thirty thousand miles service turned into like eleven hundred dollars you had less less flushing objectors let's clean the upper throttle blades less flush the intake manifold let's flushed about and then at the end it sets less flush your wallet\n[laughter] it was one of those so here far better off to tell you what I'll do\nI and I said this before you give me that written portion of their contract\nAnd I'll take the deal you pay me the monthly payment and I'll take care of the ... the here's the deal we have to draw the line we got breakdown and parks failure and then we've gotten maintenance and if you're radiator fails but you didn't do your flush when you should have I'm not covering your radio right that's what the contracts as\nA here's my here's my most egregious thing we had a lady come in with the ... she had an after market warning to just like you guys you call up and you had some little\n...\nSelling you how to fix the car and he wants to send you a radiator from Japan or China or South America or some ... island in the Pacific he wants he wants to tell you how much the labor is and he wants you to reuse the ... and you know can you tell I'm getting kind of mad\nAnd I didn't watch it or if ... if you'd actually yeah they're going to stand on the radio average liberating let's get in trouble county of Kentucky there's that's it that's it so this guy says I'm we're not going to want you to read and I said why not and he goes well she Mr transmission service\nAnd I said so what's that got to do with it goes well the transmission service may have said the radio so I got a broken pack buddy I don't

years of experience and um and all of us have been all the way from engines to oil changes and everything and everything\nWe had a twenty six hour evaporate or the other day on a Chrysler [laughter] wow wouldn't want to say our it was it was the dash from left to ride it was the front seats the console the steering column and then half\nOf the fire wall on the other side [noise]\nWhich one is that on I don't know I was just happy to see it [laughter]\nHow can I say go back to gather I'll tell you what I was really worried about is if the ... I told a technician don't leave this property and he goes to lunch she gets in a car wreck or God Forbid he I mean I mean if you go to the hospital I didn't travel with that I Know he's got a five gallon bucket of boats so I\nSaid you're not allowed to leave the shop and do you get that thing back together All right let's go talk to Jeff because we left them on the other side Jeff thank you for holding as long as you did um how can we help yeah\nWell thank you guys are pretty sure you I'm I've got two thousand eight Ford Explorer a six cylinder\nUh my son tells me I've got a vacuum lake I get a a cut idol I get a flood or and then when I'm going up till they're accelerating the err err on the lower ships from the vents up to the uh um windshield to produce foster\nOkay um what are you guys say go\n... ... he's got a backing late whether the vacuum these cognitive flood or not can be completely separate but he does have a vacuum system problem\nAnd and what we know this because the default is the windshield what we call the top ... so we got windshield center Vinton floor that's the correct terminology boil the water [noise] no I'm just teasing him\nWe know that if you got for a few got center event and and you throw it all up then as if we go to the default position which is the top of the dash now we've got a vacuum legal we've got something in that circuit\nSo it's most commonly a vacuum like as far as the letters concern I agree with you if this vacuum when he was so big it would have a tough time idling and you'd probably hear sucking noise underneath the hood yeah kind of a [noise] an issue that set of chickens in like ... you should ... co check engine light so I'm\nQuestion breaks uh what about what what am I looking for a break [noise]\nWell it depends on your driving but I'll tell you something if you do your oil if you do your tire rotations every other oil changed like you're supposed to they ought to be checked on the brakes\nAnd so that's where you take you get a constant reminder of your brakes\nBut really and truly my wife said eighty eight she's we're not even close to being done on my truck eighty eight but I and I'm I'm not even close to losing a lot of 'em run eighty two hundred thousand al ... and and that's so your answer to is is next time you're going for your change get attire rotation then by the way boys while you got the brakes uncovered\nI Want to know exactly where I'm at most of us are going to give you a thirty second or in my case we're going to give you twenty five percent left fifty percent left\nTo or we use a gun number so you got fifty percent gone the ... it's a man's shops going to make it clear\nTo you should be looking out for when he says you're close to the river so\nThat if I'm not mad I had a\nCar is put on it at the discount place and I looked at the ... like you feed it brake pads they look pretty thick me but I'm just looking you know real quick\nI was the brake pads usually as about as thick as your your mouse pad also so it's about three eighths of an inch very good we along with me on something like that so anyway if if you got if you can see the pat and I'll tell you what\nThe pad better be thicker than the metal behind it yeah yeah okay okay look at the metal backing the pad better be sicker than that I just came up with that is that not really until\nI can I can as real quick\nAlready thank you very much stand Richard Gere up next Richard how can I help you\nGet good morning up I thought maybe that call and but you are the hundred and Twenty years experience you can answer this question for me okay I've got a two thousand to dodge Durango he ate\nAnd I've had in my shop a couple of times in the uh favorite chopping the are compressor kicking out all it's it's kind of do but it's not coming out of thin very little coming out of the ... and so they taught me that it was a computer\nWas setting travel where in stride or the dash and so I thought okay I took it down to that dodge dealer down they're Seventeen the camel's back\nAnd explain that to him and he goes oh yeah we can get in their ... well after I picked it up and up and they didn't do anything shark and about three hundred and fifty bucks\nAnd her lawyer comes out of the fence on the dash\n[laughter] there's so many things that this can be it can be the most which can be their condition

need to go right to the point the point is is that you're having a tough time accelerator pump bad the wells leaking down inside the engine where the carburetors leaking out of the bowl it's been sitting in a long time I got the wrong gasket under the base of the carburetor taking too much in the days feeling vaporize brought all\nI I agree I agree so there's lots of things that this can be

Seventy five to one fifty I can tell you what's wrong with it and there's a possibility I could fix it for that money on yes\nSo it's this isn't a big deal but ... looking at the fuel filters not the way to go we we don't care about that if it will do Seventy miles an hour\nWell that alien Ford made [laughter] I'm just season signing okay if it's Seventy miles an hour there's nothing wrong with the fuel delivery system right okay because that's a high demand so I'm teasing me about it for police except on my ... okay thank you less thank you very much harder to Europe next how can I help\nYou Hi Geri Geri drops from let's go to Rick okay Rick you're up next how can I help you\nWell I think you guys already did help me with one of your callers by saying I couldn't go to your website and maybe signing on as a garage because I I just moved here and I took into place with my family was going to\nBut then they said I Need to embrace and everything so I had to relearn Braves put on but then when I get my car back they to one of my a brand new floor match input in an old tour of one\nThat we're in right\nYeah I went back to them and said you know like this is right and I haven't heard back from or anything so\nOkay what let me comment on this first of all let me explain something the best car repair shop at least on my website it's written this if you have a problem with one of my shops you have to file a nice complying with the better Business Bureau the owner not on your show I understand I understand let me finish [laughter]\nYou have to file a nice ... nice complained to the better Business Bureau for the better Business Bureau tells the shop to make a refund or fix your car and the shop doesn't do either one of those I Will up to five thousand dollars topics your car up to five thousand dollars a refund you the money that the shop didn't kick their butts off my list or I'll fix your car\nSo ... and that's never happened since Nineteen eighty eight it's never happened so best car repair shops is a good place to go but my word is my bond\nSo I've never pay that money came close last year [laughter] ever pay that money the shop owner was dragging his feet a little bit more and I gave him a deadline and said you're either going to pay this customer I Am was uh twenty it was a two thousand dollars a dispute and the last minute he came up with the money and so he's still him\nHe was just that mad at me and but he agreed to that thing so um and as far as your roof format concern I Want to make a construct just your suggestion to you\nI Would go find a match in Paris format that you like it pep boys or Walmart or auto zone or wherever\nAnd I would say to them here's a picture I took it with my phone of the formats that I Would like to replace this with because you lost my driver's side and the ... the set of format as eighty dollars so I'm looking for eighty dollars from you that would eliminate a lot of of of of having an Hawn\nSo at that particular point depending on what he charged you he ought to just pony up baby doll yeah so anyway that's my suggestion to your Rick ... thank you for your compliment but best ... when you go to mark Salem dot com click on the ... best and others I'm Out there of our shops and there's mechanical there's paint and body there's transmission\nAnd there's these little do we have a diesel thing too as well anyway uh you know what I I did that pretty damn good have you got any other color sitting there I Hope the Heinz rope already well we're just going to talk to the end of the hour so unless somebody calls and then the next thirty seconds [noise]\nBeing a master tack it means that the car is divided into categories so if you just passed the suspension category you are ASC certified in suspension correct me if I'm wrong correct if I'm not going to ask you to name all aid because I can never do that you want to try eight\nSeconds right okay go and then repair go suspension breaks automatic transmission manual transmission differential a engine performance\nAir conditioning and electrical an electrical okay All right LA added light duty diesel now okay All right that's a master tech\nYou're going to do all of those yeah you're going to do all of those and pass them and you have to re certify every five years\nIt takes us a pass all eight of those tests because if I'm not mistaken isn't a five six seven hours\nPensions started to fall out of common usage and instead we started to see a defined\nContribution plans and buy that I'm referring to IRAs for one k.'s and such not the defined benefit programs such as a pension\nAnd the problem is that that hit mid career and I know many of you\nWere subject to that to where you went to work you thought you had a pension and then mid career or later you found your pension frozen or you found yourself being given a lump sum option instead\nAnd then of course that the government changes here just a few years ago where tensions are no longer guaranteed that used to be prior to that changing the law that once your pension started you had some guarantees that it would always continue and\nWith longevity with market performance they got in with the pension guarantee fun being\nOverly stretched the where they really didn't have anything left in it the loss had alright well if you can't continue your pension you just can't continue your pension\nAnd so that was when we saw a lot of this and which adversely affected mostly baby boomers having the lump sum options are having their pensions frozen or both depending on how many you had or what your employer decided to and that's really the rail some people's retirement plans know boomers\nInto a certain extent genetics years have had to work their way through this transition\nMeanwhile for the millennials I think they've just grown up accepting the idea that OK it's four one K. is and I are re the job that they get will automatically put them into a four one K. or allow them to make irate contributions or or some kind of contribution when in fact in the automated\nAnd then it's really important because the millennials have the fall when kids come back we're so that's a huge that millennials did the auto enrollment and they all they can they opt out you have a huge group of millennials who have far\nMore saved in previous generations on the other side you had baby boomers who had no access to four one K. so early in their retirement they had possibility of pension\nNo for one k.'s and only a minimal amount that could be put into IRA starting later like in the eighties I Believe so they ... they didn't get to some of those early years that were so important\nIn the same manner that we've seen particularly millennials and and also Gen access\nAnd one of the things we have learned over time working with ... and four one K. is is that if you're able to start early and contribute over a period of time consistently that's the simplest math to go\nIt is you know that's going to be one that will be successful for baby boomers are having to think a little bit outside the box I think that's culturally indicative of how baby boomers are anyway one other thing we had happened with baby boomers is we had that two thousand market crash and then we had the great recession of\nTwo thousand eight well with the baby boomers being older\nWe're finding that it has been\nCloser to retirement with fewer years to make that up so that has also been a challenge for that age group\nNot just a challenge but I think also a lesson that perhaps Jeanette ... and ... also noted and have awareness of you don't want to take a hit to your portfolio as you were just approaching\nRetirement or just entering into retirement something that we've talked about many times a sequence of returns risk\nRight and as you get close to retirement we often hear referred to as a retirement rent is on so your market risk becomes exacerbated by retirement date risk and yes it was in the news a lot in two thousand eight to people who were following it could see that the person was trying to retire in two thousand eight nine ten that was their\nTarget date for retirement when or if that four one K. course real estate to to this big hit\nThe average length of time that a person was having to postpone retirement and keep working much five years people were hearing five years and even today I still come across people every now and that never did fully recover from what happened to the with the crash in two thousand and eight\nLot of boomers are continuing to work in retirement and two thirds according to the surveys say that they planned to were already are are working past age sixty five or just have no plans to retire from work\nAnd I think there's several reasons for that and some just keep working past sixty five\nSimply because they like what they do we have to again look culturally a little bit out this because uh during the time the baby boomers were younger there they were expected to make a difference in the world they were expected to achieve and as a as a generation\nThere was this desire to give back and to help others and so forth\nAnd and I think that was a cultural phenomenon so then we have\nThe baby boom you know the hit bill boomers today they're going\nMore discretionary time so we see a lot of them continuing to work some for financial reasons likely adjust sad but others because for health related reasons meaning\nI don't want to have my brain turned to my shoes on but I've heard some people say to me\nAnd I want to maintain that\nSharpness and so if I keep working then I'm going to be able to stay mentally alert and I will just stay more socially connected and I will be able to continue to be productive and the idea of being doing a complete retirement not appealing to that group of people now so we have some that do financially we have some that do it\nBecause they want to say protective and then we just have others who just like what they do and they just don't want to stop and some will work until they can't work anymore\nI I think also that goes to the the shock of the two thousand a downturn\nIf you use your skill set these days in in this work environment\nAnd this labor market you lose your skill set you may not be able to jump back into the labor force so easily\nCertainly not at the level but you think you would like to be at so how do you maintain your skill set how do you keep up on the technology and other requirements of a job where you keep working\nYou keep working then you can take additional classes and look at how many people when the computers first came out on out into the classes I Know in our area of the senior centers were offering computer classes to get people going\nAnd understanding it\nYeah I'm doing the question above and beyond that is what do you want to do in return what is your retirement dream\nAnd let's dig into that as we continue this conversation we're taking a look at a retirement and how people feel about retirement and very comprehensive survey of different generations outlook for return\nWill

[noise]\n[noise]\n\nNo your wife Margaret ... was certified financial planner believe women have been where no one\nWas for joining us today from ... to ... with Nancy ... from swimming financial services\nAnd if you have follow up questions on anything that we talk about on this program get in touch with Nancy is really easy call for huge heroes six three to eight seven seven oh\nFor a zero six three to eight seven seven to and I know you answer a lot of questions that folks who have ... you can just be you know a little follow up on something that they heard us talking about\nA war you can contact through the website Fleming financial services dot com and we've been running through the idea of\nCore return it looks like there was a very comprehensive survey done is the Eighteenth and your retirement survey we've been talking about the vision for a lot of people but there are also some fears that are associated with retirement\nThe big one out living my savings and investments outliving my money\nThat has been the number one here as long as I can remember I think it's directly related to the demise of pensions uh-huh I remember with both my mom and my dad and they had\nHad separate households each of them I dad had a pension plus his Social Security mom and my ... her husband had a pension and Social Security\nWhich of them were extremely comfortable in retirement neither of them had ever had any kind of interested investing between their Social Security their pensions\nThey committed they lived every bit as comfortably if not more so than when they were working they weren't afraid of running out of money\nBut we entered the next generation of the baby boomers square pensions went away you're needing to save and then turn your savings into income\nTo replace the income that you're voluntarily giving up or maybe not voluntarily if you are you know are forced to retire and right\nAnd that makes for a person really nervous because it's not like a pension were they guarantees that are there so how do we create the type of a retirement plan that is going to alleviate this this biggest fear and I think one of the greatest services for many people on their retirement plan\nIs being able to create this base of where my income is coming from\nWhen is it starting what accounts and my taking from first second third or which ones at the same time and how does that look moving forward\nThis is this has made a lot of people feel a lot\nMore comfortable than a lot more secure\nAnd has really taken away this fear because there's it's it's a solid plan\nAnd they're able to keep you know keep on track of it and keep up with it and monitor just like going in and you're having a great you know your your physical ... gosh your cholesterol is lower your blood pressure by well you don't just say\nOh this is great I don't have to go back you know using created and then you monitor it\nAnd always making sure that as that\nLife changes a family changes your needs change you're still able to come back to this because you've got your plan in place but then you're also going to have a plan\nYou know you got plan a than be be one me to know different and the reason we called their retirement roadmap as they liken it to the old road trips where you you know which way you're going you have your map set out but sometimes there's a detour remember when\nThe highway broke up was eighty nine that was trying to you so you couldn't get take that eighty Ninety nine more from here up into Utah laughed and so you had to have it doesn't mean you weren't going to get to Utah and just meant that you are taking a different route and this is how the same thing with your retirement plan\nWe want to have all the contingencies that built in places and usually retirement\nLife has a number of things that could happen and we just look at each one of them and say All right well what if this one happened\nWhat at that one happened and then how would we proceed\nRight is always nice to have a contingency plan in case of an emergency or in case you just want to do a little sightseeing alone would\nExciting is great right so you've got your plan and then they had people come to me and and come up with again with the travel okay we have this idea we this year one and take whatever special trip how does that look or\nThis year we want to make us or to purchase or this year we want to provide a some kind some money to our grandchild who just just excelling when they go on to college how does this look and so we're able to put that in and and see how it looks and\nVacuum by smart retirement with certified financial planner they've living\nSinclair and do\nSo much for joining us today from my smartly term is taking a look at the retirement surveys is a very complaints of survey on the tournaments\nAnd they asked\nDifferent people in different generations the millennials the ... and the boomers their views on retirement what they think will happen in retirement or what they are actually seeing and retirement here's a big one for many people were to live in retirement\nThis is a big one here in Arizona a lot of people know there's really no better place for the winter\nBut where to live is where do we go when the summer heat yes right so we're just pretty much pass it anymore but where do we go it stays in our mind and you know every year ... it doesn't ever changed as it is always\nDid like can we really the mountains can we get to the shore what can we do to get out of this desert heat in the summertime\nFrankly I found that there's quite a few people that like to buy some type of RV or travel trailer and then you can use that you take your house with you so to see you didn't stay there\nWhile you decide where to go each summer and go someplace different weather my ... love doing that yeah super popular here yeah some people feel stuck if they just buy a house in northern Arizona\nThey only at one place to go well beyond the ... wonder less hits and so they want to go out or they\nThey do a time share and then they're like oh well I've been to the times your mother I get out of it now\nYes and that's the mindset of people who who do that in that\nOr at least for people to come see me that's a big thing where we talk about okay when will you buy this and how and so forth and that's not everybody some people really want that second home and so when you really want the second home or maybe you're you're going to do are being and you eventually find a place that you like\nWe want you to go ahead and stay in the place where you think you might want to move\nFor a period of time it's one thing to go and visit for a couple of weeks and get away from work but once you're there for a long time then you don't have the backdrop of distress of work then what does that feel like is the pace of life comfortable for you are there enough activities for you to do on the next on an extended basis\nWhere you live is important and and I think in Arizona we do kind of the river snow bird ... get out of it you there are folks though from Chicago in Boston in Buffalo maybe it works for you maybe done\nMaybe you find that you want to be back around to the familiar setting that you're in some people try and um move overseas\nOr they're they're looking to move to a place that is less expensive\nSo that they can control their expenses in return\nLess expensive is a big one and of course smaller towns are less expensive but then you turn around and say what is there to do in a smaller town anymore to as a statement on our society people are also looking for an area that has a low crime rate\n... ... so that's a big thing um and so I've had people actually by elsewhere I had a couple who really really for the longest time not that they were going to retire and then they were going to go ahead and buy back in the area where they had grown up\nAnd but when they went back and they didn't they hadn't been back there a lot so when they went back and bought their house and it was in the mid west of town was just so much smaller many of the people were older and some of their health wasn't so good and they just found that\nIt was boring to be there for an extended period of time and so they ended up having to sell the home they bought and they weren't able to really make any money on that they might have had to give it out\nAnd so we really you know things like that happening your retirement dollars are important because you're you're you've stated what you're going to have any sort of fixed it so that was a bit discouraging for them and they realized that they should have actually gone back there and just stayed for a few months or\nEven for a season for two or three or four years\nBefore they actually made the commitment to buy the house\nOr another as access to a health care and and my parents went through this they actually had moved away to northern Arizona up in the mountains that place up in the mountains they lived there they they liked it up there it was great but they were not near a health care facilities\nTo the nearest town was about twenty five miles away\nUm and at a certain point their health started to deteriorate to the point where they needed to be around doctors more they moved back to the Phoenix area they were close to their doctors closed to hospitals and so forth\nAnd uh the final years of their life that was more important than being out on the mountainside\nIt becomes important your parents aren't the only one that has said that to me so it began this really alright magnifies different stages of life\nAnd the different needs that you have at the different stages of life so for example um you probably that's suppose that you wanted to do you know go out and buy some land out in the country and build a house while you're probably not going to do that in your retirement years you're probably going to do that when you're young and\nThen you liked the idea of maybe raising the children outwards fresh and you can have that fruit trees and things like that\nBut when you're older the idea of taking care of a large piece of property may not be so appealing because you may not have the energy or\nIt helps to maintain a large piece of property so then we see people selling the large home are selling the home that had ... downsizing just the opposite of what you would have done early in life when you were trying to get away from the little apartment\nAnd into the bigger house so each stage has its particular and unique needs and you just feel differently at any given stage of life so this idea of having um someplace ... except we all have in common not having a desire to be in the heat\nFor four or five solid month so regardless of your age I think a lot of people will agree with that one um so how is how is that are going to be worked into your plan\nAnother important point I'm for many people anymore retirement does not mean the end of work\nFor many people they plan to continue working in retirement more than half\nFifty six percent man to work after they return or maybe it changes maybe it's not full time work maybe it's part time work maybe it's I'm working as a volunteer paid or unpaid whatever it may be but a lot of people are going to keep working well\nIt's funny because when he first started ... I can easily ask people when you plan to retire and they meant they plan to retire and not work anymore\nAnd the last so many years I Would ask that question okay when you plan to retire and I learned that definition is a different the definition of retirement today means and giving up that job where I punch the time clock and then giving up a job in corporate America\nWhere it's just really difficult and I'm entering retirement mini retiring from that job\nSo I often have to say All right when do you plan to stop working when you plan to start having her and then come because we have half of people leaving that job but still going into a work environment where they are working for themselves are working for a friend or a small company or whatever it is they choose to do\nAnd that's now being referred to as a semi retirement and so\nSometimes I'll get the volunteer well yeah I'm retiring here but I well I guess what I should say is I Am getting semi retired\nWell and actually that's a transitional phase you go from working fulltime corporate or whatever it may be um to whatever the definition of retirement is where you're still working a ... that can be a big transition phase\nIt's a huge transition I'm I recently had a gentleman retire super involved in his work and very very much\nJust good at what he did but just too many hours\nAnd the first time I saw him after he retired and he did stop for next day I Do not thing transition and ... I had he is not the first man to tell me that that was really really rough and so the first time I saw a couple of weeks after that he didn't look quite\nSo but he says yeah this trend is just been harassed and he said I don't know what to do that by the time we hit a month or two months out he was just in glowing with health and energy and looked super happy in one of the ones\nWho ah when they hadn't decided he and his wife had decided part of their planning would be to have some type of an RV\nOr fifth wheel and they were taking time to go up in the mountains and it was so refreshing and relaxing or them that was a very important part of their retirement lifestyle we're planning then and now they're track to where they were going to go up and you know you can buy those um national senior passes anymore\nAnd they raised the price of something like Seventy or eighty dollars which is a one\nTime the for your whole life yes nominal for such a bargain and so they were in the process of there and buy one of those they tried to get on line but they was going to take too long so he said I was told when I get to the national forest\nI'm going to buy one there and they were going to do that you know the corner there the Grand Canyon and Bryce and diet just and several weeks they're looking super refreshed in super happy made my heart happy to see that\nTheir joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as we think of\nNo bill you should do recently the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why age ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's
