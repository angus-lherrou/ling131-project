it's it's um it's unbelievably rare unbelievably rare\nItself for uh people it's varying degrees of challenge but that's that's the way it is that's the reason I have a happiness hours the reason I wrote a book on happiness is the reason I lecture on it\n'cause if you can bring people to understand certain things than you can increase their happiness and if nothing else at least have them act happier because that's a moral obligation not to inflict bad moods upon other people [noise]\nSo today's subject is a as a life change or if you take it seriously\nWe determine how others see us\n\nYeah if you get that people think that some objective reality determines how they are seen by others but the truth is your behavior determines how you are seen by others\n[noise]\nAnd I'll give you an example you you may recall the the show with a remarkable woman Gail McWilliams who is blind\nAnd who if you meet her\nYou don't think about her blindness you just think about Gail Gail is is charming and Gail is full of life\nAnd that's in other words she's not when you when you deal with her you're not thinking the whole time she's blind you're thinking the whole time she scale\nThere are blind people with whom you would think the whole time that well I'm I'm dealing with a blind person\n\nThere are people who have I'm giving you some pretty dramatic ones and and the issue here is not blame or anything like that is just to tell you the truth about how you are perceived and I'm going to give you other examples all of them are sensitive by the way everyone was sensitive example [noise]\nAnother one is ... parents who lose a child\n\nThat can become and I'm not blaming or anything else but I'm just describing the reality that can become their identity\nThere so and so uh she lost her son she lost a daughter he lost a daughter she lost to some or that is part of their by auto biography but it is not the defining element in how they are perceived\nBecause that's not what they radiate\nWhen they meet you\nWhat ever it is you or the one who determines how others see you\n\nBut it's also true we'll give you another example for minorities whatever the minority might be racial\nOr sexual or\nA a\nReligious you determined\nBy and large certainly in the United states and the United states you determine how you are perceived\nIf you are a racial minority and you are\nOr your self perception is as a primarily a victim of racism you will be regarded\nAs overwhelmingly a member of that group rather than as John or Susan ... take too common American names they're probably not that common now frankly\nYou want to look up the most common names I should learn what they are and use them now what's the most common birth name of it last a little bit for girls and boys\nThis is this is a big big deal\nYou you are a ... you are in a religious minority\nYou you are the one who sets the agenda on how the majority will regard you\nKnow people and minorities don't think that way they think that that's how they're perceived the whole time I suspect that there are are we haven't we have the names there the link or they're going to need to go I mean it\nWas the main but it's okay it's okay you that you know the amount of them I Know I Know that are here we are baby ... dot com\nAnd the answer is for ... nuisance K air we go for I don't believe that Liam\nLiam is the number one baby main for boys this past year\n... you don't believe it or why would they make it up\n[laughter] who has the lead magenta [laughter]\nPeople break up the cause they ever ... but ... it's very now number two I Do believe Noah\nWhat one\nWhen I'm In it now the female number one is Emma I Believe that number two was Olivia\n\nVery very nice and what is there we go number forty\nIs savannah how many savannah is the you know\nAnyway All right so that's what I'll do now from our I'm OK Liam or ever\nThey go by the way to John even on the list\n...\nJak is yeah I Know but I don't know but it's no joke it's amazing with Susan on the list\nThat's you've got to go to Nineteen sixty because Susan ... may\n... she'll through [laughter]\nBen is on the other hand you have to go to the nineteenth century\n[laughter] you\nKnow it's not there are no young ones died anyway you on the one who sets it you know I I have been since I was in my twenties I have often been in places where I was the only Jew and I realized very early on it is up to me\nTo make everybody relaxed\n'cause they ... it was great it was a great revelation to me\nThat ... the obligation ironically 'cause I I I Believe Americans of goodwill and couldn't care less your religious and ethnic racial background doesn't matter you want if you're gay you set the agenda whether do they see you as\nLiam how's\nThat act or as\nA gay guy you set that agenda\nDo they see us primarily black or Hispanic or in my case as a Jew or do they see you as Dennis that doesn't\nDeny that you're a Jew doesn't deny if you're a black and doesn't deny if you were gay doesn't deny you if you want every minority group here in it doesn't deny it but you don't wear it any more than you where I Am blind or you where I have lost the\nChild is almost impossible for me to overstate the importance of this subject because we have it all backwards we think that that's the task of the majority to make the minority person or the person who's different\nBut it's not talk to people it's not talked\nAnd so people walk around in this society thinking that others have these a pre existing beliefs about them because they're X or y 'cause they're\nEven a lesbian blind lost the kid sat\nYou determine whether that's your identity that's the point of view it's a term it it uh do you determine that by the way you behave\nYou were if they see the interesting thing is you may be preoccupied with that aspect of your life but it's your choice about whether others are preoccupied with that aspect of your life\nAll right I think that that even makes things clearer ball right Minneapolis, Minnesota and the famous Susan of Minneapolis\nCame down is I Love this topic because as a high school teacher\nOr I Am working to impart the idea all the time to my students that they each have a plan and their advertising their ground all the time through their behavior for now and then I'll have a student

don't know cause you should not feel guilty anyway you are ... ... is that correct yes correct or Iraq take it away my brother was on your mind well\nI I've learned a lot of things from that is on um one of them I grew up in a in an environment and culture unfortunately in which\nIt was always agreement a person for most whether you like that or not and um and clarity we're not caught among adults and so um\nI I'm I'm Wondering and I listen to your I pick up a few things here and there but I'm Wondering if you have a question or a way to ah when you got a strong opinions are differing views with people\nHow how to achieve clarity\nOn what it all back to the other adults right well\nYou have to say first of all it's a very important question am I I Will work on a more elaborate answer a butt off the top of my head\nFirst of all you must be clear ironically I'm using the term you have to be clear that what you are seeking is clarity\nEven though you may want to win an argument you have to sincerely seek clarity you can desire to win after that but your primary aim must be where do we differ\nThat's that's the ... the most important whether it is with a spouse a friend or or a political foe where is it that we differ let's try to establish that then we can argue on on who was right\nBut first at least let's figure this out when I have done that with the Cold War is about half the time the conversation and did something like this to the truth is we don't really defer that much at all do we\nKnow that interesting and then other times it just becomes clear if somebody says for example that\nUh uh I ... it's a good example my last column was at ease Donald Trump or a massage must\nAll I saw was clarity I had no desire to defend him not defend him it was not the issue it was written after the election so nobody could charge me with trying to influence votes I just wanted clarity on the word\n... if right and and I think that I provided the venue before you answer the question or answered the charge that this man or any manage a massage and missed let's try to define the terms\nAnd it turns out that sexually object to find women doesn't make you a massage I missed it makes you a heterosexual\nJust as sexually object to find men if you are a man makes you a homosexual not a man hater\nThat is the way male sexual nature works it objects defies the object of its attraction\nAnd here's the great punch line it is possible to respect women and objectify them at the same time\nOf the vote in in the Bronx was analogous incidentally three hundred

I don't have an answer to that in fact the only thing you could do is a ... it's really short of acknowledge one I always say the elephant in the room to look\nObviously we really differ on these matters but it's very important to me that we we just continue to feel good about each other in every way possible and be loving and if you are on board with that I'm On board with that and and

got that wrong OK okay fair enough so you're in America you're married to in a region yeah okay that's not exactly detective work on my part but I was just curious anyway thank you for calling go ahead\nFor a while or is not there is there not there is there enough so they were there were so many issues that you raise here was so we'll take that one first\nThey're not only not offended on Christians perhaps it is not possible in their view to offend Christians there is as you probably know a famous or infamous art work quote unquote with a crucifix in the jar of the year in of the so called artist\nNow uh as I tweeted out last week if you put a uh if if you put a ... in urine or you would be an Islamophobia if you put a tour in Europe I mean you would be an anti Semite if you put a crucifixion urine you're an artist\nAnd and I tweeted that very exact the word for word what I just said for that crowd is not only not possible to offend Christians to the best of your ability you should [noise]\nSo uh is the fact that this is ultimately a war against the Judeo Christian civilization that the west is built I Am convinced that that is the ultimate ... of the left\nThey hate the idea of a Bible based value society they're frightened by it and they hate it now the second issue is the use of the terms God and Jesus Christ it depends on the context so I Would say for example\nIf somebody says God did you see that home run I Do not believe they're violating the commandment against using God's name and paying\nA lot of people do and I don't and I explained what I think\nThe commandment really means because I Know that she grew very well and the Hebrew vet commandment is do not carry God's name in vain not to do not take God's name and fame and the people but I Believe carry God's name and vein of the people who in the name of God do evil\nBecause that is the only one of the ten commandments that caught says he will not forgive\nIt so it cannot be that it is about oh God that I have a hard day at work today or Jesus Christ I just really hurt my finger I I I it's hard to believe that God will forgive murder but he won't forgive that\nSo it has to be really bad since that's what set is said God will not forgive\nThose who violate that amendment and it is doing evil in God's name\nThat is that's the worst evil atheist evil is evil\nReligious evil is the most evil the Islamic to or doing evil in in their God's name are doing more harm to God and religion than any atheist group that has ever existed\nOkay that was a very important thing and you should all watch my my to eleven videos at ... university on the ten commandments and read my little book on it which is based on those videos the ten commandments\nAh it it uh I Believe that it will affect the way you see life which is why they should be okay and now Steve in ... Ohio hello Steve Dennis Prager\nThere how are you there I Am really well thank you\nThank you for taking my call I've always wanted to ask you this as quick as I can point for foreign you remember the Rolling Stone article about the girl who was yeah it was totally fabricated made up right\nWell\nI feel that nobody touches on the subject that the way they adopted our kids from kindergarten through college for the left or the liberal society should own culture and our colleges\nLet me let me react to that because we don't have a lot of time and that is a very big topic a I don't believe there's a rape cultured college needed to you but your point is excellent\nThe left his so saturated the university's with sex deliberately so or robbed America's children of ...\nThe ... and the structural realm and that's what emissions is about innocence is almost all about sexual knowledge\nAnd then complain about the sexual those Asian apply for college they put men and women together in dormitories\nThey have them share rooms share showers\nThey have a six week I'd ever university\nThey have demonstration of sex toys during six week and other times and then these dishonest human beings have the audacity\nTo complain about the sex drenched you'd miss that permeates our our universities they have created all why wasn't there a rape culture when their rules when I went to

most precious of all liberties [noise]\nThat is religious liberty\nAnd there's a case not here in the United states thank God but in hockey son\nDeserves some attention it seems to me [noise]\nWe were talking before because of Nikki Haley made a very profound point in fact maybe that's worth playing again [noise]\nA a Greg if we can because Nikki Haley's focus the Al Smith dinner and her you murder has gotten a lot of attention but she also sent a serious message\nAnd the message was that one of the things that has to happen\nIn American politics is stopping the idea that if you disagree with somebody over a political issue that person with whom you disagree is necessarily evil that is not true I Do not believe that the Democrats are in general\nEvil and maybe some but I Can't even\nThink of any off hand who who's an evil Democrat don't call me on your nominations for an evil that we have a lot of ... deserve to lose actually I Hope that all of them lose this time they want all lose because we have a two party system in this country but the point about this\nIs it there's a difference between evil and foolishness or even corruption and\nHere's what a Nikki Haley had to say about there's the Al Smith dinner and she said it so well that well let's just have her say it herself\nWe've had some last and I can find at ourselves and our political rivals that really they want to share something I Believe is important\nTo say at a lot when I take the high school students and a college student\nAnd are toxic political environment\nAt her some people in both parties\nDescribed their economy\nAs enemies are evil\nAnd South Sudan or rape is routinely use as a weapon\nIn Syria where the dictator uses chemical weapons to murder innocent shelter\nAnd North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier was tortured to that\nWould have in the last ten years I've seen truly evil\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\nOpponents are not even\n[noise] we are to laugh with the political system that allows them to resolve our differences peacefully\nThat we are all Americans and we are stronger and health care one way or United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that and particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb she's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what does or crime well here is the other way it's described in the wall Street Journal\nUm it it it turns out that are troubles began and again this is eight years ago with a squabble over a cup of water on a sweltering summer day in Punjab\nTo Muslim women accused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother a mother of five and the fact they accused her of polluting the cop that they were all drinking from on this hot day because she drank from it and she's not a Muslim\nSo in the midst of this argument allegedly ms baby told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani law\nTo talk about blasphemy is blasphemy so all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to cross examine witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten\nShe lives in a windowless cell there have been international efforts to free her\nAnd um [noise]\nIt it's just unbelievable they're already people who have died in her case or shortly after the span villagers accused ms ... blasphemy and they had her imprisoned\nThe following year court sentenced to death she lives in a windowless cells where she cooks for herself for fear of poisoning by prison staff or a fellow inmates against is bankrupt a standing up for his bb requires courage and ... and then two thousand eleven as a year after she was\nCondemned the governor of Punjab governor Solomon tough fear\nOf visited her in prison to try to show some sympathy for her and right after that visit and his expression of support for a sea of bb his bodyguard killed him two months later\nA gunman killed Shabaab ... that's another a Christian politician who also opposed Pakistan's blasphemy law\nIt's an unbelievable thing this is a nuclear power now why am I talking about this right now not only because there was attention to her case and there's a new president uh puppies Don ... who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star\nAnd maybe just maybe he will show some mercy on this poor woman the problem is that President con\nSupports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed for saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um does your ... incident I uh I have been troubled by some voices on the right who want to say that to show the\nAt one time and his wife had been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week in the Washington Post\nHe was no Islamist he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom\nIronically the the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently\nWas done domestic show he is sad I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well are we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power and as a very important ally the United states over this one episode\nAnd\nIt's it's a remarkably important that we move forward we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one of the things that the Democrats do wrong as they want to make every last thing about Trump\nAnd or do I think that Trump made a mistake or comparing well saying that they he should be innocent until proven guilty it's like Brett Kavanaugh comparing\nThe potential murder to the uh legit at I Believe imagined a solved by a Seventeen year old high school guy who ... ... and ... and it was halted that culminated in groping\nTo compare that to a brutal murder and dismembered men and torturing a guy in cutting off his fingers and and then slicing of his body to transport out of the country [noise]\nThis is not comparable and it's also not comparable because this was done in the name of government I'll tell you what scares me most about the show the story is that stupidity if sometimes more frightening than arrogance or pure evil\nAnd how stupid do have to be if you were planning to murder some journalists to try to do it in the consulate in a foreign power\nWhat do you think is going to happen how can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get caught they wanted to send a message but that's evil to send a message to murder and torture is hideous in as evil and that's wrong\nThat you would think so a school's everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that\nGirls go into girls restrooms voice go into boys\nAnd if you've got a student that's struggling with issues you could accommodate that you can allow him to use a teacher's restroom a single use their facility but you never allow them into facilities or the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia is being thrown out the window\nBecause of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOkay as so Pasha Thomas who by the way is African American not that it matters but uh\nAnd it's usually you'd think that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who's doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children [noise] um what what happens next here ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education\nThat has since been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously looking into whether the\nSchool district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy [noise]\nOkay uh so uh it in the best case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother in Decatur, Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that\nAnd to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working it is causing harm like what happened to\nPass his daughter there are better solutions but the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the ... the cater school district that here\nOkay I'm speaking to match they matched sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who um I'd give heart and\nSoul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skill to this cause but everybody's in a position to give a donation and it's really important because right now\nEven with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington DC\nOr religious

orange you\nWe have we've had some incredible wins from the Baker jak Philips to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently cheap Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one point two million dollar settlement after he was fired by the city of Atlanta for writing a book about his Christian beliefs okay\nBe part of this and take part in it um maybe there's not that much we can do right now to save
