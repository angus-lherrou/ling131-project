effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress and how your kill max formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium or we're\nTalking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list many of them is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI'm not hurt a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that he's involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if there was a low levels of magnesium your heart\nBeat two very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd then this this was associated with a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nSo so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said he drank so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes you ride any do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the uh after you drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nThough the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually take into account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is including arthritic pain\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of various I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older he's they're linked there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happened is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spun the nickel museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired tired and tired mhm and that's it's a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more arrests or whatever\nRight that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of museum\nAnd that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting on life you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah in your body that actually starting to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and is

the year which is exactly why you should be doing everything you can\nTo protect yourself no matter what time of year it is\nSo what's the best way to protect yourself from these nasty viruses the colds and the flu will here today to share his health secret\nFor shielding against viruses colds and the flu is Dr Michael Pincus documenting gives his great to see it again Chris it's great to be here you know most of you probably know the doctor and it gives us a nationally recognized authority on both natural and alternative health he's also a very successful chiropractor he's been ... by top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns to Dr biggest what is this how secret that you've been talking about\nWell what the secret is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C.\nVitamin C. or I Will um vitamin C is is not really new though no vitamin C. does not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell\nAnd unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends in the bottom line is with out enough fight him and see and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies diabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be shorten by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contained to sixty five milligrams of vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three to four thousand yeah and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of\nOrange juice so because of lack of vitamin C. they were getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick a little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well\nThe number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just saw any energy I don't feel like myself I'm hurting yeah and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we've got to do these tasks sending through the scanner\nAnd the problem is is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd it was interesting the human body is one of only a few males who do not make our own vitamin C.\nAlright the other ones there aren't any pigs primates and the fruit bat when you look at the rest of the animals out there you don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure you don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness\nAll the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nYeah belt produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick\nAnd tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it yeah right\nBut you know I think most people myself included thinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so\nWe're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the\nMelodies that were suffering from is that you know what it is actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my supersede twenty two formula\nAnd as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down if you have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... your body needs different forms of it\nAnd I put it all into one vitamin formula\nNow and you said that was how much vitamin C. and your supersede Tony to foreigners Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what what are some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're gonna experiences energy vitamin C. produces energy and the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is it okay if I read an email to sure sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay I'll listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped\nIt he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days he said no another thing that happened is I became more alert and I now have a clear head off from vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nI Want to let your listeners know that if you want to get a free book about vitamin C. and try Dr ... super see twenty two formula absolutely risk free there is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C\nI mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I didn't go to the supermarket before\nI got here [laughter] okay and I brought some vitamin C. and I went and bought these and I'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this\nThis particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in it so it right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C. that in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients All right\nSo this one has a vitamin C. well just one type of ... right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... they'll cellulose has grown up newspaper\nRight the next one is uh vegetables Derek acid now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form\nA and the next one is a sort of like a silica sand sand like the beach\nSorry so here's another one try this one here okay so we have national brand

greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Miller leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system or energy that's just one vitamin C. wow\nNow earlier you you talked

University has\nSaid that there's a lover of justice for everybody but Jews should be welcome to study in Israel\nAnd university are supposed to question or learn how many people with those terrorists that are met affected are negative way the Supreme Court of Israel needs to be controlled it has proven decades\nThat it is the farthest that court in the world and we need the rain or there and we

and we hope not the last what follows before I speak to David is an abbreviated resume of our guests today\nDavid ... with his MSW as a community organizer by profession but it's much much more well he's best known as a writer investigative journalist and an accomplished analyst of Mideast each of the middle east issues particularly controversial once\nMr dean is reported for news outlets suggest CNN Radio\nMakoto showing Philadelphia Inquirer did you supposed to the world Jewish review the Jewish world review and many others\nIn Nineteen eighty seven David but dean establish the Israel resource news agency with office is the bit to grown international press center in Jerusalem most notably he serves as director of the center for Near East policy research\nToday we'll discuss his work investigating unreal the United nations relief and works agency the organization that has served the agents\nOf the Palestinian cause perhaps more than any other\nDavid thank you for joining us today\nIt's on like court in a frog just outside of your ... very\nGood thanks [noise] uh let's begin with a simple question understanding a ... is part of the problem more than it is the solution in addressing the Palestinian issue could you elaborate and explain why an agency the United nations would be considered\nIn essence an adversary of Israel\nSure what the scholars can you say a lot of Nineteen forty eight looking on purpose to keep the flame war going into the national purpose\nThe personal conceptual idea what was coming from Iraq will Swedish diplomats who was trying to dismantle before it got started a trickle back of his head and convince them to stop this activity for twenty first Nineteen uh she'll sit there in the seventeenth in forty eight\nAnd I'm In his memory long before we started 'cause I deal with the counter to get rid of the law return with the right of return with a permanent\nDagger in the back of Israel or even in Nineteen fifty eight to keep it going to keep the the the American people will look for the forty eight re idea illusion but plan would be the problem is that it would take their own struggle in forty eight\nSo to say we want an Arab countries where they are ... today\nAnd not only five million barrels register as refugees book and go for the gold eighty three percent of the people living in ... one going for a million they refused to any they're not allowed to have any uh improving in their lives\nAnd if I don't think anybody United Nations but either way\nIf it poses dictated by the donor countries\nAnd the one of the country six eight for them to our country has until recently the largest automation war the United states now President Trump pulled the plug however however the the the countries in the u._k.\nUm in Germany Saudi Arabia have\nCome in its place but again what we're hearing are the naval to uncovered and wait and see different here is policy research we've we've all their school books we kill them they're filling it with the film at schools go near solo camps everything\nThey're on our website is real behind that news dot com and when you show\nA system going created to basically foster not injured I don't think it takes me at all it's just a matter of a commentary on kind of a war war war machine amongst with children cows and ... thousand children with training a similar\nTo march on their homes for forty eight for firing bombs on those loans to kites and uh and balloons and then by trying to cross the border a same in the other and\nTo our children well motivated to sacrifice their lives and get get themselves killed as many as possible so that you will see a little into the middle of stuff for a little little harbored\nAs they show their uh their determination and of course the world the western world doesn't understand a people that will put their showed it on the on the front lines but recommendations for the listeners that I guess I look at our website\nWhich showed all Israel behind the names are out and I strongly recommend that you look at the films of Hitler Youth that were that were discovered by ... by William Shirer who authorized involving Third Reich and it was an officer in American intelligence\nAt the end of the war in the short films of the youth as they were being trained so if you want to understand but I Do understand the Hitler Youth and the man\nIs not something coming out of the un all the way or the or the Arab countries only it's coming out of the western nations that refuse to treat and consider a cut back or conditioning friends\nOkay David I've looked at a intimately with you a website as I've spent time looking at the website from the United nations in ...\nUh and it's remarkable the juxtaposition hum of uh of what's seen um we have a commercial break coming up quite quickly but let me just ask you this you brought up the subject of the the schools in such\nA they'd been studies conducted by your Senate for news policy research which examined hundreds of school textbooks um which basically or had been underwritten by the United nations\nCould you tell us something about these jihadi propaganda that they seem to serve\nWhereas ... can go to the United nations school books written by the Palestinian authority with the funding of five western countries and the support that the active support us in every other western country\nAugust ... the problem with the pillow\nAnd and and on the regular at a recognition of how to pay a little or nothing similar eighty eight which has continued until President Trump unilateral unconditional against the law allowing a terrorist operation to operate without any opposition and get anyone to care about this and he was us or anywhere else has been very difficult\nOkay or if I wanted to see just a quick sampling of what the school books include where could one look\nIsrael be fined news dot com easy upper right hand corner you see the latest school looks the same goes all over it and as you as a strong on the right side of the intro behind the news um you'll see it after all and you see I mean they're staged a push towards his articles locally and\nLook on the search engine Palestinian education is exactly what we got\nAnd this is the tragedy is waking people up to this reality because it's not something people want to see people under the illusion of the peace process\nOr the peace process for point of view for us but he was a great thing for a lot of income it's a lot of accessibility to the markets of the Arab world and many Israelis have become very wealthy for however the the in terms of the ultimate goal of the pillow and the Arab League they haven't changed a little bit libertarian changes starts\nAbsolutely and you know thank

agency's Palestinian refugees is five point four million it was actually in the Palestinian peace it\nCame out last year which they claim to be six million I think can be really targeting that six million number\nA number of course is much less and the reason is because the UN is you'll explain a counts all descendants whatever after ... might exist the way beyond Nineteen forty nine my question to you David is is\nUm is Israel's somewhat it's fault for a lack of ... the PR undertaking this virtually absent in light of the numerous social media platforms available these days who is the world simply disinterested who aren't interested in hearing these really perspective\nNumber one the world was interested\nTo see I don't think they're also falls\nAt three in the wild promotional who in the private field and the private sealed on the other side has been taken over by grooms were very very sophisticated\nAnd all my problem is with what I what I I haven't I work with experts have come to the last ... and they can't even call them the British Parliament and and the one thing they all ask us we're humans we show\nThat I show you what we're trying for our wages that old but I explained to you that show being taught in English and I don't know where you're finished watching the show I don't know that they're going to the elderly and that's one of the problems we're facing in other words there should\nBe a there should be in the media organization and we need to try and what's going on and you know\nI Want to get just I compare to what happened with this Little America will be a little bit as well as following in the sixties mhm well I I mean it just didn't know it did not get involved and that was the biggest problem we faced and ... and and this and until Saturday an enemy of of\nWashington but no longer motivate Jackson valley amendments to this to a halt all kinds of trade and benefit from the Soviet Union didn't take off\nSo we have a problem of Jewish people who sit back and they're watching the ball game and not really getting involved in the ... actual material however they don't pick up the ball and do something with it and I've been covering tonight then you go out and and we we're we're totally finance prime but\nPrivately and you can see it on our website we look for donations I was able to get one guy one guy can to put up with money plus but they're experts to the un this week the Israeli government indoors but it was very nice but I didn't want anybody to me as really government because you have to show that coming from private initiative and the crime of\nSelling the or the so the reporter came and the within three quarter of an enemy speaking and he said well he talks but you said how is it\nBut you guys can support the uh in the ... the extermination of Israel at the same time your business deals going on and some of the Arab the interlocking into one of the leaders of the pillow in Jerusalem he says you don't understand first to them because they don't kill though\nAnd he must be getting some kind of the Marx Brothers or the serious but that's not something that people are people in the west can understand that the person had a bifurcated personality\nBut should this week we had to really just coming partial we have the big personality dish my L. uh stars who makes a cameo appearance with one neighbor and received the angels are the same kind of it's called it's called an animal and it is and and and they really act\nBut understand that this the the two sides of the of the ... what we're dealing with here and we've seen in the pillow and very very clearly David I end the Jewish support\nWhat they call the peace process all the money making good because if you support that pay a little maybe go there's Nineteen eighty nine I wrote a paper that they were twenty four organizations\nAnd human rights groups are entering the U.S that will get grants if you support the regular today there's a hundred and eighty organizations like that my colleague Jared ... excuse me as an organizational and monitor you want to get sick of watch what they're doing and uh they're appealing to the American Jewish what I call it a triple trauma syndrome\nOr the people who are on your shoulders nations who are today because I'm sixty and eighty\nAnd they have in there and the traumas and their background in the civil rights\n... McCarthyism and I'm\nDavid allow me to say this I think the fall is also that Israel's on September thirteenth Nineteen Ninety three\n... will happen to what we did is would that feeble hang she did was offered by ... being what happened is we made the enemy kosher we basically said that Arafat below which tells you in fact we actually allowed him to\nChange the payload to the ... to give it some kind of cosmetic touch whatever we made them ... shows with us a little too we made them ... with the Y. agreement we made them kosher two thousand we meet every single time we meet and pretend that this is a Bible piece partner\nIsrael is at fault because rather than send a message\nTo the adversaries an implacable enemy that wants to kill Jews as you rightly say we say no no I ... a bone there must be the boss is a peace park near the fault he's hours there was a failure on the part of Israel and strong advocates of Israel to see what ... what I just said\nWhen I was in that one has to look in the context here obviously you know you're seeing someone who's been a very loaded and plenty of this process and investigator this process so you're right in the open door but let me let's go over the context\nWhen Ronald Reagan and I hate shopping shut the pillow down his throat\nAnd became an advocate of American policy\nSo nice summer Ninety to Ninety three hours after being in the stream into power the American government made a dictator\nAnd they said this is what's going to you're going to take the pillow as a partner and they made it look like it was a you know how to make a decision that was not it was done and when and when ... when Israel was in ... when the explosions doesn't go people are happening but very fine whatever recently passed away Robert ... Cohen\nShe rabbi higher and higher for the only Rob I live close to Sharon you want to see our Sean and Sean pulled out a document of all the American dictates\nGet rid of and she was a guy is a matter of fact he showed the less ... come kind of see what secretary of state I wandered she was out of Gaza know or else on August twenty eight Nineteen Ninety three is understanding two thousand\n... and you know\nI understand that he is free market dictates and now we have an American president I'm not pro or con because I'm not I'm not there you guys are in the American electorate over there we\nHave an American president who's really took banned in the Reagan policy that Reagan in ... which again with Reagan and finished with Obama and now if you aren't responsible I Want to be very clear about something\nIf the state department or the American or the or the congressman or a way that's the sort of gets ten Fifteen twenty letters\nAre saying it's according to the the idea that the pillow should not you should not be in a stroke and should be respected that gets attention a friend of mine just retired from the U.S Congress from that\nThose are kind of separated my age sixty eight and a retired I said okay how does Congress work he said and it's very clear it was on the hill for forty two years he says if we get a letter in Congress from ten to\n... from ten people of course people going to take it seriously nets are saying\nThat the people who hear this program tonight or this afternoon or whatever it happens to be makes it clear\nTo Congress couldn't couldn't couldn't go to the White House et cetera but that the that the way it is a little bit of a big issue right now as to whether or not Congress should we report about the crossing the thirty schoolbooks than being held back from the state department look on looking I'm looking at what's left of it and she said oh the government accountability\nOffice report which is supposed to come out it hasn't\nBecause he said the Bartman doesn't happen but Lori on ... the better it is an American the bronco she also has really living looks on people getting involved\nDavid ... hold on a second as David we're already going to make sure hold on a menu running of the\nTimes you've got two phone calls when I asked you questions I just want to be a combination I I'd like a short answer from you\nOr you mentioned to you know the Reagan betrayal and everything else uh obviously the pro Israel community was euphoric who with a with Trump's\nUh um election and the fact that he chose the foreign policy team that seems to understand Israel yet today these really press reports whether rightly or wrongly reports and perhaps ... or\nSomething just to test what the reaction would be the uh the uh the Trump is willing to possibly suggest who is willing to put together a peace initiative which would suggest in East Jerusalem actually be recognized as the capital of the future Palestinian state as an incentive to get up to the peace treaty or to the larger\nMission Germany could live with their according David in my investigation\nAnd Nineteen Ninety five when the Jerusalem a damage the ACLU's was watered down in front of a which would allow for Israel to become become part of Israel\nAnd allow for another country to come in in other words you know some of the capital for Israel and water out so they wouldn't recognize Jerusalem as the IRS was part of Israel now there's these sloppy ways we have a very sloppy away\nIt wasn't Jewish organization that they were furious and then she gets it was good that they look at the embassy well where is the man from Georgia organizations around the world from your listenership that America should recognize Jerusalem as\nPart of Israel that's right and we'll get superficial\nAnd they're super ... of ... and and so they can with what Trump is doing is following the policy of the American Jews better drink or two yeah and they let us found asking you what do you object and because of the fact that the American ... look at this moment you know the embassy of Robert ...\nWhat it is and go to every single time that I'd be appeared on this radio program which is every other Sunday I mentioned in I remind people that despite the fact that we're thrilled to Trump ... is president the United states government still does not recognize the sovereignty of um Jerusalem in Israel I've mentioned it\nRemind me here in China and out\nEvery single time as as evidenced by the fact that my two sons were born in Jerusalem and their passports they are born in Jerusalem doesn't say born in Israel I'm In\nMy man I'm like I'm very pleased to hear that but again make sure that ... twenty people write to I'd like to the state department into end and every congressperson in in I'm In Arizona I'm sure that it was reasonable rate on Congress would like to hear from you\nAnd in fact I've never failed to bring it up when I have a guest who is pro Israel who himself doesn't bring it up a that said let me just turn to the phones so we have mark in Scottsdale was the question for you David Mark\nYeah David about a year ago today we lost a great call how doctors the Carol so I Would like to dedicate this show Dr Carroll and\nHis family are there are a bit in there and I think everybody should think about Dr Carroll at what he did for

market strategies are so important and why should not expose your retirement to the risk of the market\nJust reminds me of something you know here in the valley of the sun we have all these beautiful hiking trails around been some can get pretty rocky and steep the other day I was watching some kids climb up on a tall rock and had a steep face\nAnd they got up to the top they weren't even worried about falling they had no thought of how they were going to get down there was just no apparent concern for potential bodily harm\nBecause I watch them it dawned on me how risking their Bali health because they were young they had no concern\nAnd it's very similar to risky money and retirement they both have consequences for example when we're young we have no problem going up those hills in rocks slipping and sliding then coming back down a little thoughts of danger consequences\nAnd along the way getting some bumps and bruises it's just easier to heal up from it when you're young\nOnce you get older though we may still go hiking but it's probably with a bit more cautious and\nThe reason for this as simple as we get older the ability for our bodies to absorb physical punishment it's decreased and the time it takes to recover his increased\nIf you think about it the same is true for our money when we're young we can absorb the bumps and bruises you could absorb a huge losses any retirement money you know because of the time period available to recover was much longer\nHowever when you're in retirement or close to retirement\nThere's little to no time to recover from those losses\nThe no market strategies I work with allow you to see the beauty without the danger you can still get to participate in the fun without any of the market risk would you like to be crash
