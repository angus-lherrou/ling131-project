O'Reilly walked back to the dentist Prager show\nThanks for in the book that I appreciate it [noise]\nI think you've done a a memorial service in writing this and I was I think to be honest it was somewhat of a gamble on your part because so much has been written about the Holocaust and about the Nazis and so so I'll ask you then what prompted you to do this\nEvil I'm seeing a rise and evil in America I'm\nTalking about people walking into schools gunning down students\nThousands shot in Chicago by drug gangs clerics um abusing shouldering a this just small pure evil across the board and um well what about those stories I came to the conclusion that Americans are numb\nAnd I'm not deceitful and and I you know we issued statements visited with no wrongdoing and it was a shame that uh what happened happened but we went right over to bill O'Riley dot com and we have a news agency over there a half hour of analysis every day it's fabulously successful and I don't have to work for anybody\nAnd I liked that Prager\nI don't have to work for anybody I'm working for myself and I\nThat I think is the big a regulation in my life that I Am so reliable\nLoyal is just through the best ... you're working as a best selling book in the country and you're not on Fox I mean it gives so I'm saying if it proves you're ongoing appeal art now let's get back to the book you were mentioning the Odessa issue uh with regards to Nazis\nOr getting a scape patches in Latin America and the middle east did Odessa actually exist\nYes no I don't know whether they call themselves their desks or not but the set up a was um that the they used the two letters S. S. because of a of Hitler\nAnd what they did was they have this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you please shut up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted a cash\nA and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the the organization had rat line what Martin garden I call a rat line from Germany to Italy gentle way Italy where they got these ss guys down there put 'em on boats and then they went where they went most of them to Argentina where the ... government was bribed\nTo allow them in and to keep them they're protected so the red cross out of Switzerland to help the ss so did the uh beginning CIA\nAnd soda elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic so all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in a book and then the track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat and they had to be badgered\nInto tracking down Eichmann in manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's no surprises all across the book individual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil says been me much three since I was in high school so I I asked the Holocaust survivor men went through outfits\nThe rabbi Leon ... passed away and I I was with him for many many years and I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does she how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their sadism\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the the one thing that I truly remember from my interview and he said they were monsters with human faces do you subscribe to that theory\n[noise] capsule literally means as his people didn't go to hell university and they and they warn people who were uh in prison for violent crimes they were farmers shopkeepers lawyers\nWho before World War two live normal lives you saw him in the cafes she waived Adam [noise] they're all of a sudden the war starts when they sign up they get a black uniform in a dead set in ... to put on her cap\nThey walk into our with another camps and they brutalized people to the extent that modern civilization has never seen they kill babies they gas women they do the most heinous evil things that anyone could imagine and then after the war they go back to the towns\nAnd they take up their farming again it's unbelievable and that's why I wanted to tell everyone reads the book and every one that I Do these interviews with that evil exists in every person\nAnd you have to fight it you have to actively fight it or it can envelop you and if there's anything from killing the ss that's it\n\nQuiet because I'm I'm thinking of because of money for you to think about that [noise] ah so let me tell you something that I still audiences have my whole life the difference between my religious education in a regular secular education\nI was taught that my biggest problem in life is Dennis Prager in secular life there's talk that their biggest problem is America and that's a very big difference when you learn to like yourself or your word to fight your society\n[noise] Americans are being misled\nPrimarily for political reasons\nAbout the true nature of evil I'm going to give you an example that everybody will be able to respond to and it's very short [noise] Kavanaugh hearings were ultra disturbing to me and millions of Americans because we saw an attempt to destroy a human being and his family\nOkay now I don't know what happened I don't know\nChristine Ford I listen to her I never disparaged her\nBut I don't know what happened and

sixty pages where no matter\nEverybody Prager here welcome\nOr welcome back to I Hope it's walking back to his show\nAnd I have been having the\nPure tremendously interesting interviews\nAnd in ... first\nAmongst those interviews has been my reading to you\nFrom a column and then I Will go to a second call them with the Washington Post they have a feminist column\nIn the Washington Post where women were feminist or one I think in particular the feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them on the plane last night\nAnd I I shared some of them we've you know somewhat the coach\nI think that these are so important to understand the damage\nThat feminism and image if each make believe world ... oil is events that emanates from the west or make believe socialism is make believe and feminism is make believe you ... them is make believe patrol make believe\nFor whatever reason and it's all psychological it ... it it's there's no other explanation there was a\nBeep beep beep uh on happiness maladaptive miss\nTo reality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who develop them to have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse\nOr is the chances of making the world's worst or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea [noise]\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation but overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is what character respects the characteristic of the left\nRemember from the boat to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen\nShe writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing remains deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a metal leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have the feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nBut but it is interesting that there's no mention in any of the columns by her or older women riding in this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so little east to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the the word marriage does not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken but cheap there is no mention of of marriage so she wants to which way you show loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing\nTemporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what she described that I Know what I ascribe a two\nAnd then she strikes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch he said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that lie became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then why even not only put in bold for myself but underline what it was time to part\nWays I was comfortable giving him a platonic code but\nIt was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if the manager of the driver CDs of patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy well and then she wonders why she has never been so lonely in her life\nBecause what the feminist like Old West is within the make believe world\nReality it is is awful\nThen they have an imaginary world were things will be better so she says if the ... the man is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flags that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every movie makes fun of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make we shouldn't let the battle\nWhy of consent translate into boring sex see this as they say this to say that they want their cake and eat it is like it's still tried they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and relief not personal appetite implying conquest you're going to move personal appetite from sex all it's going to be used care healing and relief sounds like a visit to a social worker or therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy a different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October fifth do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise] so she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told a friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh Detroit the title but listen to this again\nI told a friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships and method oblique can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman their children left his two children that party they do want to grow up I Want to be open\nTo love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships inevitably can bring why don't you say that about anything else I'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds\nThat working for a living can bring I Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it negatively can bring\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart the children they do not want to grow up\nGrowing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms and all that stuff they are snowflakes some of them are even my snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups\nDoes it amazing thing she admits this like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post how lonely she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI now I continue reading at that\nMoment it's so difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of theaters feel stuck in the same dilemma really that's not true\nLeftist leaders are stuck in this dilemma conservatives haven't mature understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is a pain in life this is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over ... little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be up to an army first\nOh by the way just to remind her the among my this is the rational bibles but that's my five volume commentary on the first five volumes\nIt's been so successful the we're going on the fourth printing of ... is the first volume was on the second book\nYes yes I don't want to wait wait don't allow me forgive me I just want to understand you wouldn't want to argue with you watch what I'm saying you you you you would not seek to remarry because you don't want to be hurt and you don't want to hurt someone else\nThat event yet and I don't I don't trust to my self and making that decision\nOh okay that's a separate okay that's\nRight that's different but first of all this woman is is is is middle aged oil ... you know forty to fifty\nUh and uh she she never even mentions that she just talks about relationships where am I think that she would do better if she actually saw to get married but I wasn't at all the basis of my critique the basis of my critique was\nThat she's ... she's very lonely she doesn't like the idea is that a man just to is it not assertive and then if you use assertive then he's obviously not someone she feel safe with so no wonder she's lonely\nI think part of it is what I heard again I don't know who their background but\nI don't know what I saw it as someone who may have had for both of them may be more strong feminist position and now they're kind of struggling with well I found myself in this dichotomy you know I have faith that strong\nWill cut right through it yes I agree with you and and now I agree with you know you have a person\nRight but at no point the she challenged feminism\n\nBut it may be her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with this particular person maybe they're the evolution as well I mean I'm a Democrat I so I have to be left progressive\nUm positions but I think when it comes to this and my relationships and kind of my sense of\nOh no you know I I notice they're scared to do this again that's like human\nEither calming or whatever I don't feel that they

sustains and benefits this great nation it's the American family [noise]\nAnd yeah there are new numbers\nThat reinforce some other recent numbers\nIndicate that the American family at least as we've understood it\nIt now turns out that ah if you look at the number of birds that have an outside marriage [noise]\nIn the United states we are beyond forty per se\nAnd were perhaps approaching a day or the statistician say\nNot so long from now where the majority of children will be born a into on wedded families now there are a couple of reasons why this situation is dire\nAnd there and a couple of other reasons why it may not be quite as dire as we would suppose\nBut let me first uh give you some of the background of that is put together through a new report from yep you got to the United nations the United nothing and it also puts America's problems in the context of the rest of the world if you believe it's no problem at all\nThat we have almost half of the children born in the United states born into a non married couple or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six our phone number ... Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling cultural signaling cultural and economic shifts\nThat are here to stay according to a major new report from the United nations forty percent of all births in the U.S now with her outside of wedlock that is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy\nWould then means to put it in context is that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has grown up for a hundred percent\nWhy would that be\nThis report was issued by un FDA that as the United nations population fund it's the largest international provider\nOf sexual and reproductive health services says the number is even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage the eat eat you\nReport says likely sees more births out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare so said the senior advisor in economics for the un FBI his name is Michael ... and in an interview\nHe said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs in tax incentives given where\nParents support beyond what a partner can provide\nAnd is he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe that you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock set a good thing using developmentally the government can do a better job than parents or even the government can do a better job\nThan some parents by providing these services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n[noise] look the problems with a single parent families are fairly obvious\nBut one of the things worth noting here with these numbers the reason that then I'm indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nMaybe a bit overstated is at least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it is unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married\nIt's not a small numbers at least twenty five percent at least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage end up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection of and it it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage by we what are the benefits of marriage\nWas one of those things if you spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand immediately it's an extra pair of hands and extra pair of eyes\nIt's a extra loved that can be provided to the child and if you have one person who was also going to be responsible for trying to provide an income\nWell what happens to the child or two children and this is not\nTo blame a single mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes with single mothers but it's very\nVery difficult and single fathers same thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that there should be brought up as an ideal or isn't acceptable ideal\nI think it's very destructive and if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood of being involved in poverty\nCriminality self destructive activities like opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with a child is increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household\n\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and somebody can say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the stunning things and this from the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... since the decision that basically authorize gay marriage for every state in the union\nLess than one percent or have been same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number\nAnd that's shockingly low because a lot of people it assumed though there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples that have been waiting to get married still less than one percent the the highest rate for gay marriage in the country was built a shot San Francisco Seattle a second\nBut even in San Francisco their dream about one point for nine percent of all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and in the e or predominantly to unmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says\nThe data suggests that societal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce of changed\nSaid Kelly Jones the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research is it a good thing is they've changed\nI I I don't believe that it is in other words it was a fairly common in American Life to have what were called shots done weddings where\nA couple actually concedes the baby before they're married not recommended but they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married so the baby as well coming into a married home of course that's more desirable\nAnd and by getting married you were making a commitment to that child into each other\n\nJust someone down the idea that in most cases in of course I understand there are exceptions there are some times spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for a child but in most cases\nIt's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father\n\nLet's go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio Andrew you're on the show\nThanks for taking my call you back um\nSo um for me um I have a wonderful husband and um I I think that parents have to be mentally crafts and they have to be physically present\nOkay the idea that they get married later find good glad to see that but what about all those couples and and we know this is couples who are cohabiting\nAre much less likely to last long term than couples that are actually married and there's a wealth of data that makes that clear let's go to Bob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the Michael ...\nI think instead of trying to go back to the cash that society we should adapt to these new trends\nAnd find new ways of helping these kids ... and I just want to say it is you know back in you know maybe a hundred years ago uh you know that much richer so high\nThat often a parent would die\nIn the trial would or maybe you have to wait what their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives\nShow I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded to these tranche\nBut what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends are it sounds very open minded and terrific [noise]\nWhat does it mean that we need government programs horse\nThat would that would be to kids living in a single parents that George Bush\nAnd look at what kind of ... thinking of you want the government to send babysitter zeroes damage government day care centers\nI think we're going to get care shortage would be one way I think manners where you do you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these these children and help them out\nOkay do I let me just mention something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what they're sometimes families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nI I Know you're gonna wish but uh I I I'm going to say the ... where she cut defense spending because it's just\nIt's just not necessary and we should also leash characters on the rich\nOK well of course when a sandwich I hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion in most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs and the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information um\nThere is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that the blue the lid off the welfare system and the way the welfare system as it had been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of wedlock\nBirth and they're Democrats civil written about that than you'll Patrick moynahan [noise] who was a moderate Democrat rose about the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are\nGovernment wars out of wedlock birth of course
