T. E.\nThey've been around a long time feels been around a long time he's been around since the automatic transmission first came out so it's important to have that kind of skill level because as you you have to have fundamentals before you can work on a new electronics\nSo if you have a car question or if you have a transmission question or if you want someone to drive with you and you can demonstrate the problem\nThen automatic transmission exchange if you live in Phoenix that's where you need to go Susan good morning to you how can I help yeah\nHi can you hear me yes ma'am I Am I\nIn in ... and a meeting in Illinois I live with my any doubt in\nMy life and\nYour door locks\n\nWow where\nYou can you um [noise] I I've never heard of that before never um does that happen every time you drive it and you stop\nAnd the [noise]\nOkay [noise] um ... do you have a garage that you go to or would you like me they suggest one\nYeah I don't care what part of town do you live in I mean okay\n[noise] um I may I may take you up to thirty eighth avenue in Indian school here's the good news thirtieth avenue name is ... Larry ... H. A. R. K. E. R. S. Parker's auto and you need a season guy and you need to demonstrate it to them\nSo he's going to sit in the car with you and he's going to say take refer right then the more likely it's going to want to switch places we we'd have to drive and see what it is now I don't know if if we left the door open on this ... die if the door locks which stay open if we're driving down the road and we opened up a door\nWould the door locks flash on us I don't know the answer to that like a\nDark dark switch her last or something that well in that case the dome that would be on have you ever paid attention as you're don't like stay on\nNow that I mean they haven't been doing that not on any\nOkay is it inside the drivers door\n[laughter] okay All right\nOkay yeah but the good news is is that you can actually take somebody for a ride and let him listen to that\nBecause the only two things in the door that move is the electric motor that rules the window up and down\nAnd then we have this solemn noise that simply goes out and in and that active each your door locks and it activates the watch in the door but it also let it activates the button that tells you whether it's locked drawing locked\nUm it does it have anything to do with when you excel or age or do you celebrate\nIt I'm like\nOkay so you have an audio noise as well\nYeah I don't know I don't know I really [noise] okay\nAh yeah ... that we've never had that question before and I've never fix that kind of car before but I Am so new to the right place Larry ... I'd like you to call them and make an appointment tell them you have this noise\nAnd you do you like someone to take from driving you say to them I'm not going to have your technician for two hours I can demonstrate this by just driving around the block or maybe a mile down the road and back\nSometimes take our technicians and they'll bring back the next day so [laughter] but the good news is Susan as you can make it happen\nAnd probably only twenty percent of the people can make it happen so it's intermittent but if you could make it happen there should be an easy one now\nI Would like very much if you would have the shop to fix the call me so that I could learn from the repair\nOn on the idea that that may be I mean\nYou know I don't know the answer to that but I don't think so now if I give you the phone number would that help yeah\nYeah okay\nOkay well the last look up behind you Larry her grilling here I got\nIt right here at six so to\nTo seven eight\nFive five five eight\nLooks like they're ah just Monday through friday seven thirty five thirty\nI\nWell good luck to you Susanna thank you very much um Abdul how are you today how can I help you\nSound very good thank you\nI mean\nYeah we're we're having problems with the echo ourselves I'm going to turn off the three microphones real quick and and I'm just going to give you mine let's let's try it again I Do try to get\nTo that [noise] 'kay\n\nOkay huh oh an actual\nAlright [noise] hold on a minute Helen go ahead I'm Sorry when when is annoys president\n\nSo he's driving along and he's got a steady throttle does and it doesn't happen when you accelerate but it happens when you back off the throttle\nOkay oh it was only when it's in reverse okay in reverse [noise]\nI don't know what something be Robin when he says it's only the first time so it's almost like the dry chef dislike unloading okay I've got a huge joints are cherry are bearing okay or something like that where it's more it's unloading the\nDrive shaft and and and if it's got a bad joint than the first time in the mornings going to make that joined kind of be squeaky like an old guy getting out of bed he's kind of squeaky than this during the days go on everything is fine yeah so um do you have a shop that works on your bans\nOn\nGay oh it's brand new\nIt's\nOK my suggestion would be this take it to the dealer and you write a note and hang it from the rear view mirror so you can talk to the tech mission\nAnd I would say I would have the note and say I haven't noise it only happens is the first time in the morning and it's when I back up and it can be described as a squeak or a clunker a vibration it'll only happen is that\n\nAll right well so you're going to say that and and then you're going to say please don't start this car and back it up until a technician has a chance to do it because I left it overnight now if the technicians just got your car then he's going to be really glad that you communicate it to him how to make it happen\nAnd what to watch [noise] I'm In my\nMind a good luck to you and uh so do we got him taking care of and we've got an oyster first thing in the morning um and that happens a lot um but you're right I think it is a drive shaft issue and what about this brand new car and he said it was a full address mhm all ... or something\nYeah he I think he said it was a jail jail he asked for like I\nSaid as finding says that how far will try and stay that yeah okay well let's go to the phone who got bill Jim Jim good morning to you how can I help you\nIn the morning where Maria I'm good I'm good\nRiver every every once in a number of like\nOne of the whole or in any shot on the under ... how does that ruin it on cable they only make five twenty and a synthetic\n... on a regular editor area you're talking about a\nKid that that's a bad idea I'm OK here let me just give you an example put your hands together like you're praying to your wife for forgiveness for coming home life now rubbing together as hard as you can push on okay that's called friction\nSo if you're on the west side and you want tires or if you need tires or if you want to explore early ... you know tires and you don't get made him then as soon as tired and all those services to place I Would suggest you try\nSo six oh two five oh wait zero nine sixty six oh two five await zero nine sixty last hour we're talking about vibrations and when you when you get a caller getting ... says oh I'm Sorry sorry thank you for remind sorry Nick good morning how can we help you\nHey morning so I'm I've got to have you found them by ... can you hear me\nYes sir Yes sir I picked out has lived on a ...\nAnd I was hearing rooms and what we know is under the age during whale okay I live with them online\nAnd why video and it was due to a ... a controller\nFor barely make a waiter elder blend or that there are several may more tech [noise]\nSo I had a ... he had a little bit early you take it off later how it'll come to you again okay so I did I took it out I'm going out and and\nNow I'm back here and there are only there were only ...\nOkay well then\nThe hard part is is there's a diagnostic procedures that you kind of missed out and then when he took it apart I don't think you have the skills to know if the hinges bad if the motors bad if there's something that's bent or some heat related because the duck or if you're working with this plastic\nFence so it's not uncommon for us to have a problem with the door opening and closing\nAnd then we take a little grinder and they're kind of clean up the area that's just that's what's the word I'm looking for malformed this formed\nWarm yet the farm thank you for that so so those are the kinds of things that that we do when we go in there it's not uncommon for us to find half of a cheeseburger it's not uncommon for us to find any linkage that's bad\nIt's not uncommon for us to find distorted plastic [noise]\nUm there's lots of things now think of this is why okay you have the two coming in and then at the stock of the why the vertical portion of the letter why that's where the blend orders that\nSo cold is on the left hot is on the right so if you want all cold on the left than you shut off the the caught on the right so the door swings right to shut off hot air if you want a blended amount and the door goes to the middle [noise]\nBut there was a potentially amateur in the middle and it didn't sound like you can find the middle so it's but you're right\nBut there is also sometimes a process ... closed the door that's what I'm saying like a calibration procedure to where you show where the limits are okay this is the limit\nThis is the limit marriage arranged right now it may be it may just be going all the way to hot it sees a resistance for can't go any further than that shuts the motor down and it but he can't see anything in the middle of that so it goes all the cold and then stops in all the ... it doesn't recognize the in between\nMost of the time if not all the time when we do that ... programming and and let ... blend or see it's parameter we learn to\nRelearn we're doing it with a scanner doesn't have a ... right but if you want you can go to YouTube university and ask them for a really learn um procedure four year old five accurate now sometimes in the older cars and and I'm being silly here so forgive me but sometimes you hop\nIn and you turn the key on and then you go air conditioning and then you go to heat you count the five you waited you wave a dead duck over your head yong thorn twice you open the door and shut it and I'm making fun of the process but it's it's that way\nSo they're reeling processes that way there are General Motors out there with the re learn process for the ... yeah and we have to we have to open the door and have a hit and then the computer can see oh the ... just went up\nAnd then the movement of the door just stopped so I Know that's the parameters to the right so the door goes to the left ... and all of a sudden it hits but there's no increase in amped draw so the computer goes well it's not open all the way are shut all the way so those are the things that we use when we look at a scanner [noise]\nHow long did it take you to get that blend or out\nWell I think about what it's about time with it I mean it just it's a painting and get a get in there and stuff that I doubt on uh\nYeah and I I'm In front of our okay how I'm impressed\nThat you did that because frankly on a one to ten scale most of the blend doors and the cars that we work on would take his skill level of six seven eight nine ten\nSo I'm surprised that you tried that but I'm impressed that you got it out and got an end because that's that's pretty cool so your skills are a tad above than most people that we deal with so anyway or not\nThey're not AOL I didn't get\nThat [laughter] yeah yeah yeah\nI understand [noise] All right well good luck to you Nick thank you very much and we we deal with blend or a lot and the symptoms typically are\n\nStuck hold him in case I taught for ... yeah for for ...\nFor ... for a floor dash defrost um noises clicking noises\nAnd I think people don't you know not everyone understands that there's multiple you know you get out the temperature door can blend or you know all that different modes ... or ...\nYear exactly right that's why we have to kind of use words that they can relate to someone we start talking about the they said the air blows out of the wrong place will be for us as windshield center event is what we usually use and for rent is is the heat for heating up to your feet\nAnd in my truck you can put cold air to your feet as well so ... it's more important for us to have that kind of community suddenly communication level in order to say to them what the words the air coming from and it can be a temperature\nWhat's really kind of causes dust our industry to really struggle is we have now the husband can pick thirty two and the wife can pick a hundred and five\nAnd so we have two people in the car that have picked to temperatures that are wildly different\nAnd that gets to be a real big problem because within the the computer has a tough time we've got a caller gill who would that be who you Randy Randy good morning to you how can I help you\nYou're born in a town hall or a I've been working on cars in the sixties so I've been all about everything a but this is why shouldn't they have it on the line and look for ... on them and for maintaining cook here we are the issues you\nOr I was making sure that my daughter was mean hating her now in in sixty keen on so not a game and so she's you know whatever their job is not taking into a\nPlace that you know ... go okay California and uh she drove out to see me I'm In Arizona and see if I\nHad a wing she came out see me when he was getting ready to leave I said well we just chat with the services have did a tear your heart rates are all sorts of Iraq and everything like that\nSo I don't think\nAny of the oil was somebody might have just told us that\nOf course you betcha yeah\nSo so do you look at it and then I went I I'm not sure where it is so high that they can pull it but I did speak again one when we were had sold out and he would\nTune in your heart\nNow where we're at oil that was as they are actually on the topic a little one ad oil and the oil and correct yes okay it was\nA saying in in ... ... of of the ... mark yeah yes ... ...\n... ... the difference yes and and just so that everybody knows not everybody has a ... for the low end up for the high we have a checkerboard we have a variety of ways to denote add in full but yours has a a hole in the ... so yes and it sounds like you have a court more than you should have\nRight now when\nI was ... or she just kind of like well\nOkay I was a huge increase a credit card or ... you can in a damaged ...\nOr you can get along and brought me a number of other correct\nIt get some of those things most of us would disagree with but when you're right there's no good can come out of court over and one of the things that does happen sometimes as as we start phone when the oil\nAnd so we get too close to the crank shaft and all of a sudden the oil turns to a farming area in the ... the the the oil and in the old days too much oil would blow seals and stuff like that but what the newer cars were stuck on a pretty hard with the ... system\nAnd and and sometimes what happens is they want you to ... I'm going to give me an example that that seems to be the popular one is turn the key to the opposition and then throw out all the engines off by the way throttle to the floor two or three times\nAnd that's common to want it could very well be that there's a reset button on your steering wheel there is a canceled button for your cruise control there's a variety of reasons but almost always there's going to be a process and your owner's manual\nYes so on our dodge as we have the gas pedal and say you turn it to them\nNot mentioned starting on Hillary sunk the gas pedal three times that and give a process that on my Toyota Camry eat actually used you just turn it on not the engine on that just turning accessories on and then turn it to like triple A.\nAnd then turn the engine off and then turn it off or on and then often it's a process like that but I have it written down that that's how my Toyota is and I can get myself\nOkay Chevrolet Chavez three the three pedal sang hum as well so um and does that help you out\nHere to there okay thank you very much and kill you said we had somebody else yes John John good morning how can we help you to the\nGood lord I got a pretty entertaining when we are\nYeah well we had to bail out and out of jail to get him here but I but I have to get him back right after the show anyway well thank you for that thank you very much I've\nBeen listening to your friends on you know you can you help out a lot of money for a minute\n... thank you thank you relax I\nWant you know it's got a hundred miles um [noise] so it was had a a kind of low level um hold on a political rhetoric direction directing\nA direct port injection or actually it's not port it's direct injection and we're going to send the fuel into the cylinder as opposed to into the ... to be mixed with their so worship or worst brand fuel right into the end of the owner\nRay ... when I was I I Will too and I I ... up\nAnd then you get a little while and I I don't know where to hear that that would that look at their own\nSo I'm I don't let me give you ended up that to me\nWell if you want to make two guesses I'll guess just like YouTube university I Would clean I buy some mass Airflow censor cleaner and clean the mass Airflow censor but I Want to tell you if you get aggressive with it or you don't follow the directions than you break that little wire you just cost yourself two or three hundred dollars\nSo there is a process now I Would also clean the throttle blades\nAnd that's going to be with the engine off you get somebody to hold the trial wide open you get this long screwdriver with the red tape to the end of it you spray that was from car cleaner and you just kind of polish around the borders\nAnd clean the area around the throttle blades one of those two thing I think you have about Seventy five percent chance of being able to pull that off\nOkay I can I give you draw\nFrom just a second 'cause I'm up against or break so please hold on I'll meet you back here in about two and a half three minutes okay so I'm ...

going to go back to John because John had a a a new VW eleven VW in at a hundred and Fifteen thousand miles on it\nAnd he was talking about recognition for direct fuel injection and all explained that in a minute but you had another question John ...\nYeah yeah it's kind of just to follow up on your side out of ... do you mean I don't know whether or do you go and do you like it or not having it all as far as like you know and to prevent a oil ... says\nThere's nothing you can do here here's a car and well here's the answer okay this is a technical answer so you know I'm I'm I'm betting you can follow [noise]\nWe're gonna run oil down the intake valve stem we need to lubricate is about ... opens and closes okay we typically had the injector pointing right at the back of the valve\nSo the valve kept as the injector sprayed it sprayed fuel on the back side of the valve they live album up and we get fuel an air war when they took the injector out of the intake around her and they put it directly into the cylinder what are we going to do with all that oil that comes down that ...\nWhat are we going to do to get on there and that's it and and there's been times we've pulled heads off where it's plug solid being tighter intake port is plug solid and you get out your hammer and you're on your beat the hell out of it\nSo the idea is no one knows what to do and there's no fixed what to do now some of the guys are saying that they're using the heavier oil which leaves less film on the back side of it\nBut I suppose that you could probably find something to put into the air system here's the problem they had their system is good idea because the air is going to be delivered by the intake valve\nWas so if you want to put some kind of heavy duty chemical and we use it to wash the back of the vow here's the problem though\nIn K em it's entirely possible now when you took the coils off of the top of the spark plug you know there's a little rubber boots that connects the coil to the spark plug\nMhm okay those go bad a lot and when you do spark plugs you should always do the boots but it's typically an engine miss and it's not going to kill all for all six of your of your engines of your cylinders on your engine\nNow this is important we don't want to chase our tail\nSo it's not important what you did before we're not going to verify your work we're going to start with fuel and the spark and so all all that we need to know is an industry is a cranks over at the normal speed but it doesn't catch or start and it has gasoline in it\nThose are the things we want to hear now at the end of the day when we fix it then we can answer all those why questions why didn't do this and why after I did that but once we fix it then we'll deal with that and how many miles around your C R B\nA\nK well it could be a crank censor camp censor it could be a fuel bumping put a fuel pump and\nGetting out\nNow no fun already yeah yeah it is and how did you replace the fuel pump relay\nNo okay did you replace just pump or did you do the whole sending you know the whole the whole journey than okay good good All right well look in their owner's manual see if there's a few ... chances are looked just like the air conditioning relate sometimes you can switch the air conditioning really what the field bump relaying if it starts and runs then you kinda know what to do\nOkay thank you very much when you're walking my Dick you're up next how can I help\nYou okay you have a\nMemory or I'm trying to get the ... to order wonder wonder who you know if you're an adult that

capable of suggesting other shops in this environment because I I don't have their permission but if you brought that shop to a vet car to us\nWe would then check it out and we would deliver to this wholesaler who we've used a lot\nAnd he pulls rabbits out of his hats right ... I mean there's been cars that we've been able to give him specific symptoms like that dodge and he said look at the candle at\nUh the wire harness that goes to the transmission and if there's a little shocked in there and take that out and plug it in and we did that in that fixed it\nDo you remember that um we added\nIt was an noise in the murders that's only talking about no adults or I was ... there was some kind of a of a ... tale that you unplug the harness and you put this pink tail end and then you plug it in I thought that was something but he's he's very capable he's very capable on the old cars [noise]\nUm I wouldn't have any problem with given him anything from the fifties or sixties at all now what years your old car moving\nI recorded it okay I I still think he has the capability but he also has this capability to say I don't know and so you bring it to you bring it to us well we're going to do is we are going to build up straight through\nParents or whatever he charges you you're going to get shops flies environmental charges and some sales tax now you have orange going through both of us you have it through my shopping you have a through him\nSo you're not going to go to him but I'm Still in the food chain so I'm Still there for you but yeah if you bring it in and talked to Alan are handy my daughter my son and there'll be able to help\nYa okay All right ... ... that are just by\nJust well obviously Monday Mornings and friday afternoons or kind of hectic but in any other time should be fine\nOkay I didn't learn much You're welcome all in a way to hang on ... alright pick was at a forty nine forty ... okay\nI missed that ... well a hole in jeeps okay we'll use I missed that ah\nI'm over land because I'm going to write this down\nAnd make sure I'm right um anyway thank you very much ...\nMile election he has him call us first to make sure that they did this is something that you can work on yeah Dick why don't you do that um have you got your pencil handy Dick\nJirga or do okay for eight zero five nine eight one two three four I named all my kids within a so I could remember their names Allen Andy and either one of us can help you out and they and they're going to get your phone number for you rather than we ask you for right now okay\nAfter all right thank you very much I Love you about Ronny Europe next how can we help you\nThere I I oh I Am hearing ourself\n[noise] ah I Know we're not having that had I guess okay\nUm I I've got like ... on and on and tell us how ... and had a um I wouldn't want my ... a sporadic it's not not tied to\nA ... and I write our mind but every one of the oil my auto body on how to handle a rather than normal right up you know how good it said it is to say on a lark\nAnd everything going on and on and buy ... get oh now I own a bar and I and I ... I haven't haven't been doing that primaries are not\n... on up uh like like usual as they say like LA and raising is even having having here\nOkay no you're wrong I'm so I'm Wondering is this great mass killing yours is ... in the ass\nNo cause you to have an abs light on if you had a problem with one of the wheels owners I Am quite sure you have a bad master cylinder what you're describing is is that the master ... by passing\nAnd which I'm going to change everything you said and said at times when I drive this the pedal gets from at different places sometimes very close to the floor and when it's normal it's only got a ... inch and a half a play on the top end so intermittently the stopping point of my brake pedal changes\nAnd it's a master Soner has fluent in at more than likely it's leaking out of the back of it but it's it's it's connected to a booster so you're not going to see that but if it's leaking out of the back of it which they typically do than the diaphragm of the break boosters going to take a beating\nAnd so we need to make sure that we used to get the the the brake foot out of there or put a master stoner booster a combination in there [noise]\nSo yeah you can you can do all kinds of stuff to it if you want but the easiest thing to do is\nGo around the back of some grocery store and make some really hard panic stops get out and look in the front tires skid should be about is twice as long as the back tire skid so you have to do is look at the skid marks and if you're hitting on all four corners then it's going to be a master Soner bypassing\nYea which is the right\nNo it's not going to go down it's the ... which is on the cell under ... okay yeah they had no influence not going to be going down the cup which is about the size of a quarter no size of a nickel hit it has a a rubber lift all the way around it and when you push it\nIt doesn't contain the flu it in front of it so it's leaking past the lip\nThat's why it's changing its location that's why sometimes it's from the top sometimes that doesn't get from it till the bottom and I would imagine that your masters donors are very old master soldier\nHow hard it was on fire so what do you want [laughter] that's\n... ... s a hot hot that act on it and that's the only order I haven't had real any of that ad on today but no no they they just like some\nYeah yeah no abs which would chat or your brakes you'd hear chatter and you'd feel of chatter with your paddle and then if you took hard right turn left turn and stopped you'd also have the chatter and the pedal\nAnd if there was anything serious with your abs like then you'd have a trouble code and their abs light would come on and it's typically a yellow light and basically the same to you I'm disabled ... cars I see a problem I'm going to give you conventional breaks\nBut it's not very often or I don't know if I've ever seen in abs problems caused the pedal change in firmness that you're describing\nAll righty thank you very much Ronnie and Huck cheer up next how how can I help you\nI I I don't want to go\nIn and then\nWhen I when I ...\nAnd I take a lot I like that and it was like oh\nHowever when we're looking to anything that's really big it's it's always difficult to be perfect about it so that it's not it is possible to prepare enough to where you're avoiding any\nMeat yeah what I Want to say goal altering mistakes you know by ... by putting it in and figuring it out and keeping track\nAnd I think a lot of bad is making sure that you have some sort of a plan in place which we talk about all the time um you for example have gone through retirement multiple times\nRight in ... in helping people through right when\nFrom you know when they're getting ready to quit work all the way through and it couldn't some instances we've gone from that point in time all the way through the estate planning process and so\nThat's a big beginning to you know what we call it a self completing retirement plan they got all the way through their retirement and completed it\nYeah but a lot of times folks make mistakes along the way to run to talk about that today um try and make sure you have some idea of how much money you're going to need and return them and some of the ins and outs of your pension how prepared are you why are you doing all this stuff\nIs trying to prepare in the first place [noise] um you know a lot of folks have been doing some some things are maybe saving some money away\nTrying to get ready for retirement that's good but guess what there's a heck of a lot more to it than just than just that\nAnd it's interesting because of why they're very vital it's kind of interesting the number of times that I feel as if I asked you this question All right you're getting ready to retire what do you think your leak will look like when you're retired\nAnd screwed question\nA lot of people and people lot of times will say I don't know [noise] so recently I spoke with someone and they're\nHad about three people that will be retiring shortly that's been really fun to see the excitement in Montana money's been offered to do his retirement data set for next year but his players said hey can you\nGo part time for six months and he said you know\nI'm a little nervous about going from this full time to nothing he said so I think I'm going to go ahead and did a part time\nFor six months so I can get a Jesse says I think it'll be three days a week that'll give me two days right can figure out what retirement is going to feel like and look like it's really when you're working all day you can't think about anything else because having a Saturday while you're working is not the same as having six Saturdays and one Sunday yeah\nWell that's the truth isn't it it is yes it is so it's important to put these why didn't place with what your day will look like and what activities you're interested in doing people off and have a cup of ideas well I Want to volunteer or I Know that I Want to go hiking\nI Want to spend more time at the gym I have fitness ideas um I'm going to go out and help with the grandkids but you know that's those are some things but kind of what does it feel like what's it going to look like because none of those activities will take every single day so how do we structure what\nWhat it will see like how can you in and trying to visualize a starting point and the change of course because you're that you're going to have a starting point\nAnd you also have to figure out how much money you're going to need more term I mean like I said we we hopefully you've been saving some money along the way saving some assets you build up a no stake okay you got a nest egg\nYou got a pile of assets a boy and hopefully it's a it's a nice big pile of assets good for you congratulations what next\nWithout what next yes absolutely what next is that um reminds me of the story that I heard I heard you did you ever watch South Park the the cartoon a cartoon South Park I've seen it yeah yeah I had I don't watch it when we but I have seen it yeah I had\nSome family members that wash it off and on and so I had to recently and some and um because I it was like a business meeting and so they brought in the south park episode where you have that care I think his name's tweak so for those years South Park fans forgive me if I got the name wrong\nAnd he was really concerned it because he had his underpants that were being stolen and he couldn't figure out why and just so he was getting his jarring one after another day after day these underpants are disappearing so he invited as friends over and he said hey why don't you guys come over\nLet's see if we can figure out why my underpants keep disappearing and who is taking them so they come over\nAnd his last fares there and sure enough\nI known comes in takes out last year of underpants longer problem to many people realize is stealing underwear case you were wondering it isn't really the laundry eating it yes and so they stare at this moment say why did you take my underpants addicts\nI lost their underpants and the known says oh it's part of the business plan and he said\nI don't know what you're talking about so the known invites them and they go along to where the businesses and they go in and they were astonished because there's no ... everywhere there's part of underpants everywhere there's tiles on Carter's piles in boxes and they're all different sizes and they're all different colors\nAnd their flabbergasted so they asked him why are you collecting all these underpants\nShrugs and he goes and gets the man in charge you calls attention puts a flight up and he says phase one is collections\nAnd so they're collecting all of these underpants are accumulating all these ...\nSlide to question mark slight three profit [laughter]\nWhen I heard this I did I chocolate like this and I thought okay how many of us do this with our retirement plan were working so we know accumulate and we're accumulating an accumulating accumulating\nFly to question marks lived three ... successful retirement\nDoing whatever we want and then you lash the couple on the beach the flash on the cruise ship or the couple is what their grandchildren are doing\nTheir volunteer work and some foreign country but how do we feel when slide number two yeah what's happening enjoy what is happening there and just so this is this is the part that comes into their retirement plan I and I had this reinforced recently where\nI had a couple in and because they wanted to fill in flight number two you know the question mark slide and as we were working this through one member said one of the ... said to me\nThis has been really interesting [noise] I really thought that all you did was turned sixty five\nGet your Medicare just get your Social Security at sixty six and you just go on and off and that's what's fun if that's why slide number ... who is a question mark there's a couple of things we know happens when we start Social Security and we know that we're going to start Medicare\nBut other than that is it it doesn't just happen automatically there is a process that takes place in slight number two probably will expand into several more slights what we do want to fill in the question mark inhabit replaced with something far more tangible\nAbsolutely boy that's a that's a funny story but it does apply to a and I never thought that a ... stealing underwear would apply to retirement planning but somehow it did\nYes well you just have to look outside the box and the next time your underpants are missing ... really know that it's not the washing machines followed suit I haven't yet you know I have no idea what creatures are we're doing a stock plan but at least we now know where the underpants are going\nTo the grim ones do the Sox I think I'm not sure it will take a quick break and when we come back we will dig into this idea of mistakes\nThe

I think maybe the biggest\nMistake in retirement is not putting together a written plan\nI Would totally agree in fact that is such\nAn issue that it comes up in retirement survey after retirement survey and we find that very few have it quantify caught quantified written down as sort of floating around and\nBe ready for retirement is more than just accumulate as we said what are known story earlier\nThe gleaming leading the party as a s a outlook and don't get me wrong you cannot get to the next days without accumulating that is true but you've got to get to the next phase which and it involving planning for the expected the unexpected\nAnd being able to attain a successful retirement and one of the secrets of having a well defined written strategy we want retirement income needs in fact I have a\nSeven I just spoke again what yesterday who's retiring a little bit earlier than planning and I said okay now have you written out exactly what your retirement income needs are because you know when you're working you're living differently mhm well not exactly I said okay well let's get that Britain down so that we know exactly when and where and how\nWe're going to start their retirement income so we want your retirement strategy written down and we're also want to find out what your expectations are from your account and where do you have your predictable income\nComing from and we're still seeing that there's a big need there for people to be working on that we had five\nFactors are retirement road map sometimes a person might have one of them down and usually if they had one Dennis usually that they put their state went together so that's a pretty good way to get your will or your trust in those but there's other pieces that will go into it\nBut you need to include um factoring in front inflation factoring in where the income is being derived and when you're taking money and how much from which account and what's\nThe best way to do that tax why so got tax planning\nWe've got long term care needs none of us wants to become old and frail but the alternative is to die so one or the other is going to happen but if we live a long time inevitably we become older right may become more frail and we want to have some contingency plans factored in\nWe find that if these\nThings happen and expected thing I mean we do we have things happen unexpected oh there's no way we can predict the future we might be delaying retirement because the option camps that we might be continuing to\nBe offered a part time job we might end up retiring sooner if there

Sinclair and do\nSo much for joining us returning looked at\nSome return mistakes you don't want to make sure we were reading them for the rest of your life really once you're in retirement you want to make mistakes because it's harder to overcome\nThose mistakes here's one that I think\nA lot of people were going to be looking at in the next few years there saying I'll just keep working in retirement\nI have a lot of people who set up a plan of which they're going to work for a specified period of time\nNow if you said that you're planning you know you're retiring early this part isn't really for you because it is as long as you're staying on track and you're in the numbers work and you projected forward in earlier retirement and usually earlier means\nPrior to Medicare agent for sixty five because\nMany people have to work until Medicare age because of the issues with being able to buy insurance just can't go buy insurance but above and\nBeyond Medicare there are several good reason why you might want to keep working one is a Social Security\nYou could maximize your Social Security and you're talking about maybe two people if it's a couple so that gives you a little bit more flexibility there the other is maybe you want to keep working what are you going to do with your days\nOh for a lot of people they associate a certain identity with their work\nI have people who love their work and want to keep working I have other people who really like\nIs their coworkers are like the person that they're working for and is planning to workforce testify period of time to work in ... we find that most people when we say work\nIndefinitely I see a lot of people who say they want to do that we kind of see Seventy is the most common cut off aid for people planning to workout under the age of sixty six and then I still have a few people who say who in interpreting definitely is probably being eight to age Seventy five\nBut for those working past sixty five often it's the desire to roll the Social Security checks out but let's suppose that it's\nThat it's a lifestyle but sometimes is ideal\nWell back fire we have\nOf the people who work past the age of sixty five doing it to make ends meet and that means there's another half that doesn't have to do that\nBecause we don't have pensions we see people working longer and they replaced the pension with a paycheck right mhm right we actually only have one in five Americans age sixty five and over actually employed so only twenty percent so if you are working passive defied you are in the minority\nTo those numbers don't add up to ... they don't do they do there's something off there a lot of people are saying I'm Out do keep working in reality though what one in five actually do\nThey actually do right end of the so that there are several reasons obviously if you are health starts to go south where we find people and sometimes people just\nYou know they they say at six yeah I think I'll work until sixty eight will say oh wait until Seventy but somehow along the way the idea of working till sixty seven sixty eight they change their mind\nLike I you know I'm really tired of this routine I think I Will go ahead and not work until sixty eight or Seventy so and whether it's a health issue whether it's and it may not be a major health issue people just sometimes just may say I'm I'm just tired of punching a time clock\nOr maybe a spouse's health issue\nIt could or couldn't be espousing hey why don't you stop working so we can go do some things yeah it also could be that everything else is going fine but something changes where you are working so less oppose you could keep working\nWhat happens if your boss her supervisor is changed and you get a bus or a supervisor that there's not a good working relationship with or what about if where you're working some of the people like working with retire or perhaps you're where you're working expand\nAnd they hire new people and what happens then if the new people that you're working with\nOur do not have the same work environment that you had you know two years ago so you're not in a warm fuzzy work environment you know work environment that that's not a pleasant so I said so I'll have people say have my work environment changed\nI not going to stick to this plan because the lifestyle I thought it would have while I Would still be working 'cause a lot of people work\nFor the income and also for the social outlet and once you reach the stage where you don't have to do this anymore but you do it because you like it\nIf you don't like it anymore you don't have to do it so we so I Do see people expecting that if they continue to work in their retirement years they expect it to be pleasant and to contribute to their lifestyle like it had in the past\nI guess part of this in avoiding mistake here is if you're planning on continuing working what is your backup plan in case you can't prove whatever reason\nYeah can't or don't maybe they downsized so there's layoffs maybe there's buyouts and so you with the company do all these buyouts and so you're not going to be included in the buyout\nUm and then I still have people who have that happen and maybe they still want to go back and um get hired part time if your skill level is strong your eyes you'll be able to get rehired but if you let your skill level fall off so it's not up to date that will make it more difficult\nIt's amazing and I tell people we go ahead and expects them best\nBut we plan or assume for the worst is that's how we say prepared now to\nHave some contingency plans in place\nThat there's a lot of people who don't have a backup plan if that is that they they just do one point plan I'm going to keep working and if that falls apart where is your backup\nPlan who where is it yeah yeah that's that's a scary\nThought mhm I'm a lot of folks had been saving for retirement and as you said earlier a lot of folks will say that they have been saved enough\nFor a lot of folks there they're aiming for a number so you know I was just say in it but this is a pretty common on the run across a million dollars million dollar nest egg is what I Need for my retirement\nI hear that a lot sure followed by five hundred thousand so some power baby boomers the net thing be to being between five hundred and eighty million\nHe'll like and that's where the comfort level is\nAnd I find that that number early based upon what they've done so far of course and then what other sources of income they might have either how high their Social Security check as if they both have been working about checks are high ah or if there's a there's another pension or perhaps there's going to be an inheritance\nOkay let me run some numbers for you here just so you have some realistic idea and I must say that you can get a seven percent rate of return on what you're saving away because you're going to grow your money\nUm how much do you need to be saving to get to the million dollar nest egg by age sixty five\nWell you'd have to say three hundred eighty one dollars a month if you start at age twenty five\nWhat are we seeing the size of a low level of magnesium impact\nTestosterone and can we get enough magnesium in a multi vitamin\nWell you're not going to get it in a multi vitamin the only one that has it now is a purity man's perfect multi and it's important to have all these cope factors and I'm looking at the science here on my desk and this is pretty exciting now one of the things they show is yes guys we can go out and exercise and boost their testosterone levels\nWhat's interesting if we can't get out and exercise every day they did this study with magnesium and you know\nIt actually increase testosterone levels even for the guys who are sedentary so\nYeah you know it's really important to see how all of this works\nAnd here it is international journal and Raul a cheap there is a relationship between magnesium and testosterone and also our bodies strict there say here it is international journal endocrinology again magnesium exerts a positive influence\nOn ... anabolic hormone status which means\nAre testosterone here it is in the journal and magnesium research by the way magnesium has its own journal the only nutrient known to have its own journal and and it says here found a relationship between magnesium and total testosterone that's\nThat just published last year so we know that the relationship is been here the problem is\nHow do we communicate it because it's so important to get it in the context of a of a multi vitamin magnesium doesn't really work without vitamin B. six and one of the little secrets and of course we're going to get to be sick with your ... of course in a great multi vitamin it's critically important\nAnd you're going to get these other coal factor so you're getting the picture guys\nWe need these coal factors to really make it happen force and bore on this little man you need about three milligrams there's five milligrams a day and then purity new men's salty and eat it you need the five milligram so that you can get\nA boost in of course testosterone it's showing its here in the fellowship of American society of experimental biology\nThink levels helping maintain\nHealthy testosterone levels so we know all of this is important and we know how to even double it it says here and one of the journals so it's important\nFor all of us to learn all these co factors\nZinc and vitamin D and bore on\nAnd make ... we can't tell you how powerful is is\nIt's the first time ever and by the way the same cats are a little catch to it there's a little asterisk there that we don't get enough sink in our diet you have to eat about five foods to get a marginal amount\nAnd think does it get its Zorba very well well again are a little friend vitamin B. six is going to help boost the absorption four or five times so that we get enough of it\nAnd once it's there it gets bound up by a binding protein and you need some selenium to release it of course in the context of a great multi vitamin like purity product to men's perfect multi you have the selenium you have the zinc you have the basics\nThat magnesium ... man is perfect loyalty from purity products\nI'm Talking about some of those ... the ... perfect multi ... these people get the vitamin C. the two thousand units of vitamin D we talked about the money that bigger doses magnesium you're talking about losing\nAll the key by them is the key minerals and there's also a team for healthy bones you don't forget the or the high quality beach will for energy is well you you eat and put a ... or so there's\nThis ... like the ultimate multi vitamin just ferment promotes heart healthy\nImmune help brain function prostate function even healthy testosterone bill recap some of these cutting edge ingredients that I just mentioned why would the guy really supplement with anything else ...\nWell I think for me I think this is certainly it's more convenient certainly you don't want to have thirty forty bottles of dietary supplements on your breakfast table certainly this is the way to save money 'cause I I think it costs quite a bit of money just to assemble all this had to take it every day\nBut the whole point is is that we don't want to take any short cuts we want the right forms that are in this study is that I decided we want the right doses we want to make sure that you're getting the cutting edge of everything you don't ... I I if you went into a health food store ten years ago\nAnd you then fast forward it today you would see that most multi vitamins at the same list of ingredients that science changes but\nThe companies don't upgrade their formula it we've got new information we didn't know all this before we\nDidn't know about magnesium and testosterone a lot of this information coming out in the last two or three years and then of course it was impossible to do we need it with the co factors we need the dosage well for the first time just like you said\nThis is a breakthrough we're able to deliver all of these nutrients and help guys and you know you need that magnesium helps relax muscles\nHelps you get some sleep does so many wonderful things that your mood so you need the testosterone that's the big thing for the guys right\nWhat do you didn't stop there you also did these three performance factors men's perfect multi which is awesome\nFirst United the three hundred milligrams of magnesium we talked about for the guilty testosterone support so that's a big deal that huge mix you included the nitric oxide boosters promoters spectra blend the support show the nitric oxide levels for healthy micro circulation guys love bet benefit the number three\nYou have key ... new dreams like sweaty him\n... bill elaborate on these three performance factors you included the purity men's multi\nHad I think you can recall and maybe our audience can recall that we've talked about nitric oxide before it's a ... little gas that's released in our arteries that white and in some and it does it just when we need it than we've talked about this before so\nParity products now combines a wonderful blend of fruits and vegetables extracts all put in to\nBoost nitric oxide levels and of course\nThat nitric oxide signal as it ripple through your blood vessels and they ... and then ... it says single and it makes sure that we got enough blood supply just when we need it wow in addition to that magnesium

excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the\nPast year or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you just a little bit about how I got into this because I think it would give them information about how the people\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D we're going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D to when we follow doctor's advice and our government's advice and we've started putting on the phone blocking thing out of the fun and had\nTremendous effect on that light a Monday levels in our blood\nSo I started a non profit the vitamin D helpful on there you can read more information and you can possibly remember all about vitamin D\nAnd I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then\nWithin the last year so I realized that to work and fully to optimally work vitamin D you need a number of coke factory\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it in the sink and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation can learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said I'm by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't pocket on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish oil\nAnd let me ask you a question here because I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin industries might have been deep it'd be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with might have been de\n... that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's the headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just gonna read off a\nList of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they\nThese sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek are Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time
