too much of it\nThough I think most of the you know my views on the civil war and that my credentials as Lincoln than a union man are fairly well established\nBut then I realized the tweets weren't about being upset with Trump they were about NBC getting it one hundred and eighty degrees wrong\nFully wrong Trump did not mention Robert elite as NBC reported he was referencing Ulysses S grant for heaven's sakes\nGrant was the man who defeated Lee and Lee surrendered to here's what Trump actually said Robert elite was a great general and Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia he couldn't beat Robert elite ... grant figured it out and grant is a great general and grant came from right here\nIt was a rally in Ohio and Trump was extorting inventor rating grant I mean why not just said Trump was praising Hitler when he in fact was praising Churchill\nNBC retracted and apologized ultimately\nBut two things are going on here so don't let the press tell you fake news is invented or non existent first and the media seemed to have some kind of F seven macro or something a knee jerk code to do anything and everything to make every in any story about Donald Trump negative\nYou could see that with Leslie stall last night on sixty minutes as well that's just the media's disposition as one financial analyst put it on television today in another context\nI eat why the media is so hard on do on on Donald Trump for our Saudi Arabia relations when it was so easy on Brock Obama for what he did with her on the analysts said quote what you have to understand\nRock Obama could do no wrong and Donald Trump can do no right\nYep that about sums it up\nBut the ... second thing going on here is what we've spoken about in the past the willful terrible understanding of American history that we teach and that whole generations have now taken on\nI mean how this happened is very likely a knee jerk anti Trump sentiment and the thinking that Lee\nWho Trump was referring it ... and the idea that it was Lee who Trump was referring to\nWhen he was speaking of quota general who was incredible and drink a little too much close quote I'm sure nobody in school learns about Ulysses ... anymore and much less that he drank too much but he was known for that is a famous story of Lincoln saying I don't know\nWhat he drinks but find out what brand and give it to all my general ...\nIf they do learn about cramped at all they learn that he was a scandal laws to president\nAnd that is fully over ... blown that's the progressive reading of Ulysses Grant who was actually a great president so

between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty four ths Native American\nLess than the average European American but that's not really the point on this Elizabeth Warren story it really isn't the point is did she use that\nDid she used that to get her appointment to the law school faculty at Harvard which did promote her minority status it's worth asking and worth knowing and I have\nTo tell you looking at a resume it's not the standard resume for a teaching position at Harvard law school\nAny lawyer in this audience will know what I'm Talking about she has a bachelors
