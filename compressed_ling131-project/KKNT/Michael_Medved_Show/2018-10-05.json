was the same as my father's rage I grew up in a house of rage my parents were both alcoholics\nOkay I'm ... I'm very sorry to hear that but what does that have to do Brett Kavanaugh\nWell I Would not describe myself as abused exactly I Would say that I was often terrified terror I can tell he was an awful

composer the music he did absolutely everything on the new version of a star is born\nBut the question is did he do it well that's the subject of this update from Holly weird [noise]\nAnd I'll tell you what's weird about this film is people hear a star is born [noise] and you think oh yeah that was Barbara Streisand film\nThat had the song evergreen in it not a very good film that one a or a much better film with Judy Garland and James Mason from Nineteen fifty four or an even better film a from back in the Nineteen thirties a film with Frederic march in Janet gainer\nYep this is Hollywood fourth version of a star is born\nAnd you know what this version starring I'm Bradley Cooper who again directed and co producer and co wrote did everything for the film\nStarring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is oh surely the best of the series so far it's all about\nA a a very very popular successful\nCountry rock performer or in the film is named Jackson, Maine has played by Bradley Cooper\nYou stuff for example ... percent I heard it below ... percent now I mean it's incredible but we need folks who understand what it takes to make an economy grow and those are the people we currently have in place right now\nOkay so what happens if I'm In the ... the a disaster happens for conservatives and the Democrats take over the house of representatives and they immediately focus on trying to wipe out the tax cuts what happens the prosperity\nIt's going to go away I mean there's there's no other question I mean they have to point blank has\nA you know we've heard Nancy Pelosi said as we heard it looked to warrant they look for Bernie Sanders said as we heard Chuck Schumer say this bright but come on wherever they take the house over but first thing they're going to do is working on repealing the tax cuts\nHas made which really made the United states go from one of the most competitive countries across the globe to the most competitive country again back to be the envy of old craze partners across the country what are the wonderful trade deals that now are are now happening across the board look at the new NAFTA for example the U.S MCA as presidents calling it\nMisses now John sorry and making manufacturing for example\nBe alive and come back and true here in the United states have ... million my factory jobs being created and President Obama era number so that could not be nuts that may actually it was done in this country\nYeah and and what is bizarre here is a again they not only one to raise taxes and they want to kill Medicare in effect because when they're talking about one third of all the Democrats in the house or co sponsoring a Medicare for all bill\nRight what happens to our whole Medicare system if you get into a situation where you're giving Medicare to people who are sixteen and twenty five and thirty a instead of reserving it for the senior citizens who actually paid for it\nI mean I go visit Mrs ... this is one of the biggest things that we have to talk about uh nobody is actually talked about to thank you for bringing up this Medicare for all the expected costs for that is thirty seven trillion dollars\nThat was really an ... billion trillion so thirty seven thousand billion dollars I\nMean it's it's it's absolutely over ten years right so so there's no way to that sustainable with can end up happening is Medicare for all can be medicine for nothing right as far as I'm concerned is going to be the same thing that happened with Obamacare you're basically setting up a stun\nGun input on it because they can get not survive that way we're going to eventually go back exactly where the Democrats want to go which is a single payer system period\nOkay right now the these congressional races are are so close\nI I Do want people to get involved and you can get involved by going to tax cuts work dot com it's a great source of information and engagement and getting engaged is the crucial thing one of the points that people have made is that\nOne of the impact of this whole ... thing is a lot of Republicans who are kind of sitting back and enjoying some of the economic good news and some of the good news on foreign policy we're just taking it easy they weren't particularly excited or worried about this election time to get excited don't you think\nAbout Michael absolutely I mean one of the things you've been around obviously a while and then re election season called the October surprise I think the October surprise here is that the Democrats are price themselves how this whole thing Kavanaugh thing blew up in their faith\nUm and and we're going to say that enthusiasm gap for example the past week alone I think we've seen that not\nOnly in the state by state level but across the country have closed up almost entirely\nAnd so you know people are very upset with what went on there and at the end the you know obviously this entire election Michael we weren't work hard I like the big choice election right and voters are going to have to make that big choice are gonna have to vote for Republicans\nCan build on this economic opportunity right and can improve the lives of nearly every single American or they can vote for the Democrats who have promise to raise our taxes and throw really sad and in our ears and this morning that caught the choice really frankly it's clear\nI Am and again it and be especially clear because what you are voting for your voting for people like Maxine Waters would become a committee chair in the house if the Democratic takeover Maxine\nWaters the committee chair\nAnd and Jerry Nadler of New York he would be head of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already promised to try to impeach Brett Kavanaugh um look but we we're about to win I think this weekend a big victory on\nOther Brett Kavanaugh matter if it's crucial that we follow through and use this momentum to win a big victory in November and jump creators network is helping with that go to tax cuts work dot com\nBecause if you want to protect small business if you want to protect some of the advances some of the deregulation of some of the reforms and the new energy that

he spelled it about advice to his young boys love and I think they were each to Lebanon Thirteen\nOr ... and the advice he's giving them a in light of all the Kevin ...\nUm I'd like to revisit that in the subsequent hours and perhaps ah unload on that a little bit later\nBut I'm going to do something I don't think I've ever done which is I'm going to yield my opening monologue to a liberal Republican Susan Collins who today ensured that Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as the Supreme Court justice tomorrow she gave\nA great speech I was rushing to put the show together when it was announced that she was coming on and I stopped everything to watch it\nAnd uh this was this was the senator on this was the vote none of us were sure of not only did she say she'll be voting for judge Kavanaugh to join the Supreme Court tomorrow but that speech she gave today on the Senate floor\nMakes you almost want to say believe this woman to this is someone by the way who has an AC rating an American Conservative Union rating or forty five already activists on Twitter are saying follow her restaurants give her no time alone give her no peace and her\nUh in her social\nAnd our social life is is a terrible thing about our politics because it's all war all the time it's Marxist it's a Lewinsky we're going to talk about marks a little later today as well\nBut uh are you before to the gym two women from Maine\n\nMr President I understand both viewpoint ...\nComplicated further by the accent that Senate confirmation process just not a cry but\nFinally getting men a legal principle that you trust that presumption of innocence and fairness do beer on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nIn value waiting any given claim but best contact we will be ill served in the long run\nIf we banned and that's her son and I'm In a sense and fairness Ken thing so it may be\nWe must always remember that it is when passions are most\nIn plain that fair that is most in jeopardy\nThe presumption of innocence is relevant be invites they can send function when any accusation kept her from a nominees otherwise ...\nRead her I worry that part in a ... son could lead to a lack of
