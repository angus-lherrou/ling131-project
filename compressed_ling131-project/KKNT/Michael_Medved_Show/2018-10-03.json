today\nA statement on the floor of the Senate from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe gets to say when the Senate votes and he says\nIt's going to vote this week [noise]\nMost people think that probably means friday it could mean Saturday\nUh but uh you can be sure that every single senator will show up and we'll be counted\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen\nSeventy six and remarkably enough uh at the FBI seems to be close to completing its investigation a a an update over at the hill\nSays the FBI of said to be wrapping up its investigation of the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what do they found well we don't exactly know nor\nAs the Republicans repeated again and again when they were resisting the idea of this extra FBI investigation\nWill they come up and say well we found that he's guilty as sin or we found that he is as wide as the driven snow or or I shouldn't say why was\nInnocent as the driven snow or because I ... it's very very tough when\nVirtually all of the principles in this debate are white uh it's it's very tough to find some means of Maine is a racial issue but of course Democrats have been trying and trying and trying if I'm\nSteve Gomez the former FBI special agent he's\nA was special agent in charge of Los Angeles which is one of the most important\nBureau ah offices and the country he said it wasn't unusual\nThat the FBI was not going to be interviewing Ford\nThey were not going to be interviewing Christine Blasey Ford they're not going to be interviewing\nA judge Kavanaugh again I mean after all each of them spent hours\nIn front of the Senate Judiciary committee plus they have both been extensively interviewed by the staff of the Judiciary Committee apparently\nThe um and and this by the way I think is a syndicated that judge Kavanaugh spent more\nHours over thirty total speaking to the staff of the Judiciary Committee than any other nominee for the Supreme Court or for all of the others combined and with more questions asked\nI think it's safe to say that he is the the first nominee where where his drinking\nIn a high school and college has become a serious issue by the way that was not the subject of the the FBI background investigation apparently they are speaking to Deborah Ramirez who had made those comments about his freshman\nYear at Yale in the basement of Lawrence hall\nAnd ensure let let me speak personally for just a moment because as people know listen to this show I went to Yale once upon a time and uh\nI did my first year of the law school and so this was before judge Kavanaugh or was anywhere close to the campus in New haven\nBut I ... at places like that are very tradition bound the culture doesn't change that dramatically\n[noise] and the idea that\nDrinking is a very big deal for a lot of people in college I think that's true I mean breaking news and once they're they're old Yale songs including the ... song which is very well known it became a smash hit\nAre all about drinking there are\nThere there are lots of ah lots of references and this goes back to songs dating to the nineteenth century\nAnd I I Will say that does that mean that everybody gets drunk all the time no I I I was thinking about it and I I didn't drink and college sorry\nUm I Wish I could say I didn't look I turned out okay and where at least I think I did um [noise] but no I um I I did not imbibe I didn't like the taste of beer at that time and a and most of the people that I knew\nSort of and I write about this and right turns when I talk a little bit about my years ago\nAnd part of what happened is in the late sixties there was a transition and people who have been very obsessed with beer became very obsessed with pot\nWhich I thought it was more obnoxious I mean really more obnoxious because people made us so squeezed by religious thing of it with him flashing strobe\n... oh man oh wow this is so amazing\nAnd I I don't really think that anybody know not Brett Kavanaugh are not members of the cage the not not anybody or had the idea that drinking beer was a path to light and\nUh I Know I don't think that was the case so maybe at the University of North Carolina they've just published and this is part of the very needed role of a free press there's a website That's published some photos including photos of Christine Blasey Ford\nDuring her years in Chapel Hill and University of North Carolina\nAnd showing her as something of a party girl of there is a statement discovered now in the New York times today the New York times\nNot just Fox News is the New York times is covering the allegations by her former live in boyfriend\nWho says that all of this stuff about how she was traumatized they were dating for ... years they knew each other casualty averse to they were dating for six years between Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he says a number of unpleasant things about a doctor ... Ford now is that off limits well he's do\n... questioning her credibility for instance on the stuff that she was afraid of flying and that's why she couldn't make it to the hearings to testify earlier when it was very obvious to everybody that well this is nonsense they they asked her\nRitual Miller asked her about her flying and she said oh no I'm not really afraid of flying so why did you tell that to the committee and doesn't this go to the issue of credibility\nI owe all of this stuff\nIt seems to me that if you are going to come forward\nAbout something that happened too long ago from what you feel you have never ever ever recovered\nWell do you have to expect that there will be some pushback and um [noise] the the way the New York times highlights their story ah Christine Blasey Ford's credibility under new attack by Senate Republicans\nBut a includes the following the former boyfriend told the Judiciary Committee that she witnessed personally Dr Blass Z helping a friend prepare for a possible polygraph examination contradicting her testimony under oath\nDr Blass he a psychology professor from California who also goes by are married name Ford was asked during the hearing whether she'd ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test she answered never\nBut the former boyfriend whose name was redacted from a copy of the sworn statement provided\nTo the Judiciary Committee\nSaid that when they were together in the late Nineteen Ninety she saw Dr Blass use her understanding of psychology\nTo assist her roommate of the time Monica el Micheline before interviews for possible position positions with the FBI or the U.S attorney's office that might require her to take a lie detector test\nQuote I witnessed Dr Ford helped Micheline prepare for a potential polygraph exam demands and the statement Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs works and helped Micheline become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nMeanwhile ms may clean who is a former FBI agent denied the assertion today she says I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam might have taken it anytime okay\nSo here's a disagreement\nDo we know who to believe here know do we know who to believe between a doctor fours and judge Kavanaugh well we're going to find out\nA little bit more about the other witnesses and yes she identified it was Dr Ford who came up with the names bee Jay's mice and um [noise] a Kaiser Leland Kaiser her good friend who says she's never met Brett Kavanaugh\nHis allegations against him of a sexual assault they're opposed to him because he has a constitutional is conservative listen\nAt exchanges with firefighters Irish Setter close our with others that I thought one of our lives [noise] um he was clearly a poet Trent uh aggressive angry\nMajor wonder about is should've building\nIn my case yes to me it was the have you that was not a suitable for a person who would be a judge on any court much less than ... ... when a judge Kavanaugh with all partisan lift weights\nIn ... she will be on everything I think that was the disqualifying moment didn't show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing\nWas angry with Rand thing he was an ... I was astonished his his ran I mean he's a judge she just sitting\nCircuit court judge is supposed to be nonpartisan that part is enraged not the most fun judicial thing you can do when he was shooting he were unfairly to these still supposed to behave as a judge is as an enemy shouldn't be disqualifying show no judicial temperament\nBut we know one thing he does not had the temperament to be a job\nFor the Supreme Court I've never argued a part of the Supreme Court but I've written amicus brief and I said I've sat in the Supreme Court\nHow can he say credibly on the court and claim to be impartial with temperamental like that\nIn in the later it came in full of heart isn't venom keenly yelling he went down and get on the table that was like in filling out the NATO Supreme Court justice he showed a lack of judicial temperament\nThat I wouldn't want my case to be heard invite them I don't think anyone in America for public under Democrats would want someone as biased and its uncontrolled in his range I can hold and that has raged\nTemperament is just so I think he's going to be resentful [noise] I think that out of everything we can talk about the FBI investigation but even if they clearly I think that the cell phone to a whole [noise]\nCan't come out of and be a responsible terrorists out of the Supreme Court with angry Henry Hey\nBy the way let let me mention the name here the name is Justice Clarence Thomas adjustments last homeless was also angry when he testified before\nThe Senate Judiciary committee back in Nineteen Ninety One remember he accused them of\nA high tech lynching and he was angry and he was right to be angry and I think Brett Kavanaugh's\nRight to be angry there's what Orrin Hatch wrote today it's a terrific piece\nHe says we're starting to see arguments like the following even if judge Kavanaugh's innocent what he said of the hearing and how we said it is qualified this is rich says Senator Hatch\nTheory occur in the first place only because of democratic do publicity that occur only because Senate Democrats sat on ms Ford's allegations for six weeks rather than referring them to the committee investigators as they should have done immediately\nIt occurred only because ms Ford's lawyer's recommended to news for by Senate Democrats refused to tell their own client of our invitation to testify privately in California as she said she preferred\nThe judge cap Kavanaugh had the temerity to defend themselves vigorously is now being counted as a strike against him\nI think for many Americans is to his credit we will be right back [noise]\nNice to see me\nOreo con majority leader Mitch McConnell says the ongoing debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has reached a fever pitch about the truth\nIt's all about about the far less power to bring down the road ...\nBut in a man shirt\nOpening the Senate today McConnell accused downs of bullying tactics and said they have prompted he quote mudslide erroneous speculation about Kavanaugh meanwhile Senator Lindsey Graham a saint Kavanaugh has been treated like quote crap the south Carolina Republican defended President Trump's comments about Kavanaugh's accuser at a rally last night\nMission to that end of life and I would tell him not at all [noise]\nBut in the world you can actually kill somebody\nTo get him to show Graham has been a vocal member of the Senate Judiciary committee and has supported Kavanaugh throughout the confirmation process and senator said prosecutor Rachel Mitchell whose friends Maricopa County did a great job questioning Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford\nGrand says he does not agree with Trump's approach but still that his comments about Ford to be factual\nAnd stay news Arizona secretary

go oh okay it looks like it is legal here's your Bible back it's almost like this or had in the sand kind of environment where we don't understand our religious liberties in this country any more\nI yeah and what's strange year as I'm sure a lot of the people on the left to say oh it's terrible to bring a Bible to school would absolutely defend any child who wanted to bring a Koran to school for or wanted to bring the communist manifesto whatever they want to bring\nRight absolutely and we get that question off and why why don't you champion that we're we're Christian ministry we champion bringing the Bible the Old Testament New Testament to schools for Christian kids to read on their own or with others and invariably this as a lunch setting typically we're a little Thirteen fourteen year old girl or boy\nHas four or five friends around the table and they're reading the book at John or something from the Old Testament it's completely right I mean you think of I mean Michael what's so frustrating to think of the impact of the Bible on western civilization\nAnd here in this country people are wrongly saying teachers school administrators wrongly saying hey what are you doing with that that's illegal here that sounds like something from the old Soviet Union\nNo no it does entirely and see what what I ah I see from the materials that you prepared for this you\nAre emphasizing for kids they shouldn't be brandishing the bibles in front of people and saying unless you read this book with me you're going to go to hell or or I I hate you unless you come in and joined me in my face\nI you you're also emphasizing the kids who bring their bibles to school to try to bear witness you know winning and kind and a friendly way\nAbsolutely I mean one of the things I often ask friends who you know have difficulty believing in who Jesus was I say you know what what the missing in his resume he was a person who exposed\nReally espouse love joy piece goodness kindness mercy and those are the value of traits that we like to teach the kids to express to their friends and two people at the school that they bring their Bible to one of the great stories last year we had a girl who was a little shy little embarrassed to do this but she did it\nAnd to her surprise all twenty eight kids in her classroom at a public school all brought bibles but they didn't even know each other we're Christians with the whole class was\nAnd she was astounded and that's the kind of thing we're hearing across the country that you know three or four or five or even the whole class will end up bringing their Bible to school and they're going wow we never knew\nAnd I think Michael part of the problem here in our culture today for the left in the progressive to talk about the you know the harm of shaming which is good that's a good message they sure do a lotta shaming for people of faith\nTo the point where these kids are embarrassed or feel they can't bring their bibles to school or talk about God and that's not good in that environment for us to be in today everybody should bring their ideas their thoughts their opinions and their faith end of the public square\nAnd again it's can only enrich a at the exchange of ideas which is supposed to be part of education I take a gym daily a focus of the family you would have no objection if some other kids on bring the Bible to school day which is tomorrow\nOr if some kids wanted to bring in all up ... Christopher Hitchens' book God is not great or some other atheist quote classic effect and child one of the counter bring the Bible to school day was that kind of book you'd have no objection to that would you\nOf course that people should you know go and work on their own thing but for us we appreciate the fact that over five hundred thousand kids last year\nA did bring their Bible to school on that first day of our cars that first Thursday of of October and it's great you know Iran Emanuel for example who made that comment a few weeks ago saying I Know it's politically incorrect but what we need and in our public square is more faith and family\nAnd we could ... or I'm a manual send him one way to do and you know what I'm saying a marriage you know how America\nInto I'm saying okay here's one way to do it let's let kids and encourage kids to participate and bring your Bible to school and that's that's one way kids can be proud of those attributes those moral convictions that are good for our nation there's nothing to be fearful\nAbout people who want to love their neighbor\nAnd one would hope not um how did you pick October is the time to do this\nYou know it was just today there's so many special days going on now that was a day but it was available it's easy to remember the first Thursday of October every year and again this is our fifth year of doing it started with a thousand kids or the next year was a hundred and two fifty two hundred fifty thousand it last year five hundred and fifty two thousand so\nAre we are grateful for the participation and people can go to the bring your Bible dot org website we have lots of assist\nA sheets there that even the legal assistant sheet that they can print off so they can take to school that day and there's affirmation for teachers for parents for everybody to better understand what bring your Bible is all about\nWell I I think it's terrific and congratulations on it and I hope people find out more about it\nI like the fact that it's in October coming this year right after the Jewish high holy days and the whole holiday season uh we're supposed to be gaining perspective and that's the idea though to bring your Bible website\nAnd you can find out much more about it we will be right back\nOn them I ...

is exactly what he said on the point quote\nThis whole two week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit\nFueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the twenty sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on be half of the Clintons and millions of dollars of money from outside left wing opposition groups close quote\nIs this not eminently true that people are taking their revenge from twenty sixteen out on Kavanaugh as they have taken it out on everything Donald Trump has done of course it is and if you don't agree with me you have to concede it certainly a possibility\nBut when Brett Kavanaugh most definitively did not do\nWhich was blaming the Clintons themselves or himself the lies that he did but as Mark Twain said all I can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still time it's choose\nThe other lie with currency is from old friends of Kavanaugh said he he lied about his drinking\nWe have no knowledge whatever that he lied\nOne of his old friends said Brett was a heavy beer drinker guess what\nGuess what breasts Brett had said the exact same thing he said it in his testimony\nWhat he said was that he never drank too a blackout he was asked about that and he denied it and nobody not one person not friend or foe of his has countered that or said they know or new differently\nAnother lie Orrin Hatch put it well in the wall Street Journal today quote the New York times and others have gathered testimonials from classmates who say they heard the judge slurring his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption as if this were proof that he blacked out from drinking\nBut of course judge Kavanaugh never denied that he ... his words or that he ever staggered\nHe said he never blacked out\nEven AT T totaling Mormon knows the difference\nWhat's going on here is obvious\nHaving failed to bring down judge Kavanaugh with unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuses opponents are now trying to call into question his character and defending himself from those allegations it's the ultimate set up job if the initial charge just don't work will destroy him when he defends himself\nThe good the good judge is damned no matter what he does close quote thank you Orrin Hatch last week\nIt was about the need for the FBI to do a seventh background check on Brett Kavanaugh the first six having revealed to no problem\nNow as predicted the goalposts shift again but remember before we even get there this was all the Democrats fault\nThey held the Ford allegations for six weeks and in a way that would not allow for private question of Dr Ford or Mr Kavanaugh\nAnd all that could have been done as could have been done a further FBI background check on this very allegation before the case was closed during the six weeks that Dianne Feinstein held onto it this was all their time line this is their timeline now\nAnd they seemed to be in control\nNow it seems as more and more holes and Dr forwards story revealed themselves\nLike likely lying about polygraph experience after a lot of other shifting stores\nIn other words after her credibility becomes more and more of a problem it's all about Brett Kavanaugh's anger now staying or he showed last week and how it portrays a good quote unquote judicial temperament I Want to be careful here\nBut this crowd and I wish I could use another C word or for that matter a B word and an F. word\nAgain I give you Orrin Hatch quote we're told that a man who reacts with understandable and indignation when he has falsely accused cannot be a dispassionate arbiter of disputes involving third parties but we don't need to guess about how judge Kavanaugh behaves when he's actually on the bench\nHe has had a twelve year track record\nOn the second highest bench in the land and here's what the American Bar association a liberal organization had to say about him after interviewing him and more than one hundred fellow Joe judges and lawyers who have appeared before him quote lawyers and judges overwhelmingly praised judge Kavanaugh's judicial temperament\nClose quote does anyone remember what the liberal and famed defense attorney Robert Bennett said Brett Kavanaugh\nHe said if his nomination were denied it would be a double crime first because Kavanaugh has lived in exemplary life and career and second because it would deprive the Supreme Court of a great jurists\nWell the left and until I find a democratic stands up against all this nonsense and challenges their own house the entire democratic the entire Democratic Party wants to deprive not just the court\nBut a human being and his family the value of their good name I mean let's take it back a second as Ann Coulter put it Kevin ... is evidently abound or a brawl or in a drunk\nAnd yet he still managed with all that and all those problems to graduate top of his class go to Yale then Yale Law school and worked in the highest positions in government\nI mean all of his handling this Hemingway has nothing on this guy\nHe should be our president to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln after being told Ulysses Grant was a drunk let's find out what Kavanaugh's drank what brand of beer it was and let's send a barrel of it to every college student in America\nAll of this comes now\nTo a sense of proportion\nA smart Washington insider emailed me today and he said quote I Want to say with everyone else that we're breaking down barriers going over the guard rails and ways never seen before but is it so different and kind and nature what was done to Robert Bork he asked me\nYes yes and yes I said I've never seen anything like this book was attacked viciously an unfairly for his beliefs he was one of the most respected legal scholars of our time has law review articles from the Nineteen seventies were taught in almost all law schools I Believe\nBut it was his beliefs and philosophy that were twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools bread is being attacked with the worst thing you can say about a man short of murder it is a personal not a philosophical or political attack\nPork could survive the political and philosophical attack because he had the support of those who knew his philosophy and believed in it and agreed with him Brett will have a much harder time first the kids you can tell your kids Ted Kennedy is wrong about my views on abortion\nTelling your kids you're being accused of sexual abuse and rape is a different thing and immediate immediately and their childhood\nKevin ... is a coach and teacher and not wrong that if he has not confirmed those careers are over already there are protests at Harvard about him being able\nAnd for bears standing for the national anthem if you don't stand for the national anthem you will be conveyed the status of a sacrifice is sacrificing hero\nThese are just part of the new rules we have to play by and we're told we need to play by evidently these are the rules given to us by the liberals and the leftist sin corporate America as much as if you try to take the Democrats seriously they are absurd\nAnd yes of course they are sarcastic that's the point to take the Democrats right now seriously you have to be absurd you have to have a moral compass that points towards dripping sarcasm\nNone of this can be taken seriously none of it they caused this they created the timeline\nThey violated their own time lines they brought forward allegations that are fully an substantially um unsubstantiated and then they go after the people\nWho simply agree with the modern norms and by modern I mean five hundred year old norms of innocence until guilt the requiring of witnesses\nAnd some level of probable cause and if you're not gonna find probable cause\nWe will go after the people who say there's no probable cause like Rachel Mitchell you know she came out\nWith her report two days ago and she said she found\nLousy for Christine Blasey Ford incredible incredible\nCredible not believable seems now we have a lot of evidence on that don't weigh seems now particularly on the questions Rachel Mitchell Astor we have a lot of that evidence\nSo ... what are they doing to Rachel Mitchell now you're almost knew it was coming didn't ya ya almost knew it was coming they're now going after Rachel Mitchell\nGoing after it so much could you have found\nA more sober and a more judicious and the more polite person to ask\nQuestions of a sensitized insensitive witness in a highly contentious and sensitive moment could you uh found someone more deferential and more polite then Rachel Mitchell\nIn fact the immediate conservative\nProblem with her was that she wasn't hard enough I don't know if people remember that far back\nTo six days ago that was the immediate\nProblem turns out she knew what she was doing in her critics didn't so now she has new critic\nWho says she violated her duty as
