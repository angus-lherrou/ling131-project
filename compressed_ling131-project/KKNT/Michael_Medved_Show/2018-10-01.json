here in my part of Texas down the road and used them into 'em or dust\nIs our final word together today but we're together all day tomorrow and then Michael is back on Wednesday Thursday and friday Mark Davis is Michael from six sixty am the answer\nMalice Fort Worth and we've had a great opportunity to play a lot of audio and talked to a lot of oil and never knows I've shared assault or two or three so let's so let's welcome in another angle because with all eyes on the United States Senate everything is going to come down to the vote before the full Senate\nWill Lisa Murkowski knew what will Susan Collins do stuff for the world will Jeff Flake do moment by moment and this week contains\nQuestions about how long the FBI probes going to take her there was bus I mentioned earlier they wrap this thing up tomorrow that seems quite a bit the development from the White House today was they've essentially said look\nWe're not limiting the scope of this in any way examine what ever it is you want to examine\nJust so long as you're done\nBy friday and so there is a global jar reliably from the Democratic side saying wait a minute why does this artificial uh a limitation on the scope and timing of the investigation ... woman in your buddy Jeff Flake who who established is no longer than a week\nAnd and no further than the scope of what we've been testifying about so far but in a in an environment where the goalposts are always moving and the terms are always changing let us heading into the United States Senate the state of Louisiana has been very very well represented\nOf late a junior Senator John Kennedy is on the Judiciary Committee you've seen a lot of empty senior center is Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana who joined us right now what a pleasure daddy's or well to Michael med show\nTheir mark thank you for having me\nEnormous pleasure thanks for being here let me ask you the thirty thousand foot question first and then we'll we'll start to dig deep uh how\nHow does how do you spend the weekend how did last week strike you and where do you see this drama right now Monday October first\nWas so angry last week the way the Senate Democrats sacrificed doctor for its confidentiality the way they abuse the approval process where instead of allowing a confidential vetting they deliberately put out this letter afterwards\nI was furious so I went home and enjoy my anniversary and didn't think about it at all [laughter]\nIf you are a smart man you're a good senator and a very smart man and it was probably a very mentally healthy thing to do good for your health and good for the marriage so now we're all uh how many years may\nI ask twenty nine well congratulations to both of us happy wife happy life is good for user so now we're back at it and I've been listening\nTo from Chuck Schumer to Mitch McConnell to John Cornyn whoever comes after him and it seems like we're all just sort of biding time waiting to see what the FBI fine what do you think they're going to find\nI think they're going to find exactly what has already been found that Dr Ford made obviously Dr Ford had some terrible experience and she has made allegations but all four people home she says should know about it do not know about it she has a backup statement well they weren't really involved so maybe they didn't know about it\nBut at some point in our system of life not just government and other law but life\nIs for people say something didn't happen to one person says did you go with the four\nParticularly when a man toll reputation is on line or a woman's reputation or anybody's reputation it's not about male female it's about fairness and for people said it didn't happen when she said should know that it did you just got to go with the four and so I think they'll be out\nThere and and I think there'll be a vote for Kavanaugh and I think it'll be approved\nBill Cassidy what does your great state of Louisiana is there any inside buzz in the hallways about what the heck happened in that tight space with though with Jeff Flake and Chris Coons as they walked out of the hearing room the other day\nNo I don't know that I'm uh in fact I Know they're on sixty minutes last night but I just saw them and I didn't look at it um you know I saw on the screen it was muted neither none muted or because the reality is that for people said it didn't happen and there were four people alleged to be witnesses and by the way\nBy the way it's like it's like having lived his life and so it's a sterling character I'm a bad that it doesn't fit a pattern either\nAnd and the Dems are trying to come up with things that would suggest there is a pattern of wrongdoing but frankly none of when Michael ... is your is your spokesperson you know you got you you know you got ten and grew to go after somebody\nYou have the code of the day it was muted and I didn't uh new to\nHim Senate once we get another lesson in life from Senator Bill Cassidy so you have a break my piece is pretty interesting and and it seems to be that if if we got FBI probes on our mind and things we want the FBI to look at it everybody wants to investigate everything\nYou have an idea or two about something that might be investigated and not by be collusion that actually exists among Democrats to smear judge Kevin I'm\nTotally so Democrats are trying to make out like that for some sort of organic uprising of people coming out the say the judge Kavanaugh was not\nNot not credible even though the for people that they said were there set it didn't happen\nBut it's clearly is a tactic strategy with tactics\nOr would you smear him you create doubt you create down there for you to weigh they want to take back the Senate they being ... Democrats at which point they would block a future Trump appointee by the way there's already a website for the woman Coney Barrett that was nominated it's stop\nI'm I'm\nA considered I'm Sorry I considered it stopped Coney Barrett dot com and it says Web site coming soon so if Trump\nComes up with another appointee and Kavanaugh for that reason I got a point and they already are preparing now this has collusion this is a strategy and its fooling them and if they're trying to fool the American people that just have FBI going after people wait a second was this part of a strategy that\nYou seek out someone to testify against\nJudge Kavanaugh did you deliberately not released a letter until after you knew you sacrifice Dr forest confidentiality that you do it as part of a tired I think is part of a strategy to smear judge Kavanaugh in public as opposed to have a ... let's find out\nMark you know what I mean here of the American people or they're trying to see the American people that should be turned up that should be you know if you will I cast upon it\nIndia by all means if we if we got questions everybody wants to be asking all these questions we got a couple of questions we liked to have asked ourselves hey I've got a couple of our main couple of minutes let me get greedy when he was real cash that he was also on the Finance Committee big day of the White House I don't know about you as a conservative DNA and me means that terrorists are not usually my favorite thing\nBut don't go there there's maybe on the list of stuff that Trump's made me a believer I mean here's candidate here's Mexico saying okay we're ready to play nice now how did they strike you\nKnow I think the president said he ran said he wanted to redo NAFTA may read it and after that is one more promises he made that he is subsequently kept I think NAFTA has worked well for American workers in my state we have a positive balance of trade with Mexico and with Canada\nUm ah you told me or for taxes you go along the border with Mexico there's so much prosperity where they want was not\nIt's created a lot of jobs for a lot of folks in my state and across the country but it didn't need to be done and the president has already done it and he's going to take care of the American worker as well\nOh I have a trade with Mexico and Canada I think it's a good thing\nHow's your what's your um crystal ball in the midterms\n[noise] you know if the if the people are focusing upon the economy and upon the fact that President the president made promises kept promises\nThat I think Republicans will do okay if we're focused on things that are peripheral or which of course Democrats are trying to keep a focus on things that are not in a pocket book not in a kitchen table then them around a tougher time\nSo I'm hoping the American people are focusing on my gosh my life a lot better now than it was three years ago when I go with the pain that brought me a better life\nAnd finally back into the halls of the U.S Senate I don't know if you have a chance to run into a minute Joe Manchin Joe Donnelly Heidi Heitkamp believe strike you as the kind of people they voted for Gorsuch all three of them who might ultimately they're looking for a reason to get some cover to vote for Kavanaugh said that they don't get killed in their own home states\nI think you just I think if you're just being fair if\nYou're just being fair you're going to say everybody Dr Ford says should be a witness either don't remember or that it didn't happen\nI think the FBI will find the same thing so I'm hoping donnelley I kept others will say they were going to vote on the behalf of fairness shouldn't be about electoral politics it's you know what is fair to a fellow American\nAnd this will be fair to a fellow American um after both Ford and Kevin all been treated unfairly by Senate Democrats so I'm hoping they vote for fairness\nSenator and Dr Bill Cassidy of Louisiana thank you sir appreciate you being on the program a much appreciate your time have a wonderful day\nHow do you mark you bet\nSaturday ... or ... senior center from a it's kind of funny Louisiana some real turn over last few years 'cause he's been around since I think the twenty fourteen elections and John Kennedy's on the Judiciary Committee just been around since the last election hey speaking of Senate news\nDo polling news polling\nNews it we we talk about these these states where Trump won big and and where you might have some folks who might really want to go ahead and vote for cabinet and we mentioned Manchin of West Virginia and Hi Kevin North Dakota Darlene Indiana going through the head of Claire McCaskill right now in Missouri isn't a statistical dead heat\nI don't they are not at all I don't know\nWhat was then I I think I think we are probably you know but but but I think we are but I think we've gotten to the un I think we finally have gotten to the root of our issue ... ...\n... ... to get there in Iraq that name\nWho said that ... maybe it's a bad cell or something but not not at all I've I've I buy support President Trump's nominees because I Want justices that will interpret the constitution as written I have a feeling that if you oppose President Trump's nominees that's much during this whole thing is you just don't\nWant him on the court and it's not only did it\nGood I'm Sorry you're not getting wrapped I wouldn't mind being on a cooler up under the under these conditions and I go on that list I don't know K waiting at the reactor wherever we want\nWell so he was okay so so the ... so the the couple of moments where he got a little too snarky look those outweigh the proper indignation that he should 'cause I think a couple of moments ago you said you understood how somebody might react pretty emotionally if they're being falsely accused of I mean you seem to have some empathy for that\nThere's no evidence to support Dr Ford story none so what I'm getting from you as you don't want to get the judge to have it on the court because of like thirty seconds of of conversation with two senators is\nNot fair I don't really know if you've got a three way race should carry it is\nWell I think is where I think his record is fantastic on racial issues in women's issues because people of every race in both sexes deserve a constitution that's respected and ultimately I think we really just kind of disagree politically on the court and I think that's what's driving everything but I Know this time of your awesome I'm Glad you're on the show God Bless you and I'm Glad you're here today\n... none of my time for all things are men do related even when the filling guys are here\nLet's see what would you do hear this visceral we can

got ... and there was sounds like a or a person at the country yes certainly won't name\nThat's your perception um\nThat she had already made I guarantee you I write I guarantee you write\nI'm guessing that uh most people didn't anticipate that Trump is going to get a second Supreme Court nomination so if all this ideologically driven why wasn't there fought Gorsuch so much harder and wouldn't\nWant to show that that that's that's a very good question that's a that's a good question here here's a here's here's a very good answer\nHere's here's the very good answer to that question Gorsuch was replacing Scalia that's conservative frisk for conservatives are in the Anthony Kennedy vacancy Kennedy is a guy who had liberal views every once in a while so you take a guy who you know every once in a while we'll give you a gay marriage ruining her\nEvery once in a while I'll give you something else at the left or use is a sacrament\nAnd you replace him with a constitutional list

credible very intelligent people\nAnd she said the only thing I could imagine happen if neither of strikes me as a liar should I ask a question about whether he ever blacked out drinking or not why why you might change to focus on the possibility that she next remembering or she's making\nHer memory that didn't happen you yes slightly less than I Do the possibility of what corporate Charlotte

you think it's not about your perception or mine or your politics her mind if somebody makes a charge that will\nRuin a guy's life we got to have evidence and if we don't have evidence to charge goes away that's the only way to conduct our society you know this is true you know as long as our\nBlackout from drinking\nThe slightest idea and I don't care I don't know why does\nMatter you know you have a rookie drink or you have a seven year old is not enough to be drinking\nBut hires but even that wouldn't be evidence that the charges true bill you're you're just you're controlling yourself in

S. C. fighters or in which a something that was missed by many\nUh that was said by calling McGregor a during one of his press conferences and I thought to be good to start the show off today with the Ryan who was right in the center of that a few weeks ago so a ... why don't you fill us in on\nHow the world of column McGregor and UFC yes this guy who decided to destroy a bus or I think six months ago one of his competitors as he tried to get some media attention but beyond that uh he called one of his opponents a ah terrorists snitch what was he talking about\n[laughter] well Carter was referring to chew scandals so he's going to be fighting this other powerhouse named Cokie um it was last time I can't pronounce we'll call him come on and on Saturday and there's all this hype around it and\n... real scandals are are up being in the world of us see\nI'm due to some reporting out their first Connors opponent and his circle including his manager and other fighters managed by his manager I have a lot of ties to the dictator of Chechnya who is pro Russian but also with your hot if they do all sorts of business together\nAnd a dictator kind of use is is that what you see to maintain popularity and show how\nCool and and tough and masculine he is\nSo that's one thing that corner briefly mentioned but then the other thing he mentioned was at this press conference he is doing the face off but his opponent and he yells to the manager is appointment or his name is Ali ... she goes you're telling you terrorist terrorists snitch\nAnd no one really knew what he was talking about except for a few months I've been following this story and the story that Eliot Tel Aviv a most powerful manager and us the number of the ... hot cold called el foot girl famous for having these camps across the United states\nAnd being more cultures than your typical Islamist terrorist group\nAnd she flipped on them and was a spy for the NYPD an FBI or he also seemed to be a bit of a double agent because\nA white PT FBI let him loose when they found out that he was lying to them also so he was kind of playing both sides\nTo get the money and some of the money he was actually giving to grow in order to buy favor and the people that he was doing business with\nAnd and why did why is this such a a scandal in the uh uh USC I mean what what is calling McGregor and others or care about the ... what is it to them what\nPart of it was just causing media sensation 'em out or had these like Trump like sound bites me calling the manager of your opponent of terrorists Mitch\nBut everyone that looks up his background that no one knows about I'm a counter sampling for PR makes sense but you also was probably genuinely outrage mean his opponent is\nDoing all this business with a caterer Chechnya hottest\nAnd there's a lot of people doing that and basically a quarter of a dictator is you see as a as a prop as a propaganda proper him um and then also just anger at the fact that his alley abilities guy was a criminal for for ... he was arrested\nOr let him out once he agreed to become a confidential informant\nAnd we still don't know how much information he supplied or really went on there but he overseas travel for food grow and was basically stealing taxpayers' money at at some point or the feds and the and why he realized that this guy was not trustworthy and they caught him loose\nAnd at that point when he got cut loose they tried to deport him and failed and that's where he talked to a former boss of line and came forward as a confidential informant wanting to sell his story and that's how I came across um and then he decided not to talk anymore but by that point the story was already out\nYeah and I think you know in a world today where we're trying to get the left to wake up to supposedly ideas that are supposed to be their principals be women's rights me at the free speech um be to the independence of the folks to do what they want including not only fighting but uh\nUh you know anything that is related to entertainment that really isn't isn't allowed in most Muslim majority countries like Saudi Arabia Iran especially those that are Syria\nOr Islamic seats or you know HBO had a special in which they did interview that dictator and I can't remember if it was Brian gumbo lower ah who was the ... the special and I was just sort of amazed that they asked him about\nWhat his position was on gay rights for example and uh he talked about the fact that they need to be killed and ah over that was sixty minutes I think it was HBO though\nAnd ... and yet while that was a little blip for a few days it was news on CNN and elsewhere then it went back to being ignored and now we're finding like you're saying that this is the tentacles of radical Islam\nSpread when they started getting into the entertainment industry any industry for that matter are and what do you think is in the past possibly to awakening people to why this case should be a teaching moment\nWell it's a fascinating spy story when you look at his background I have a website about your lot else to grow up because it's something I specialize and and the name of that website it's ... dot com which is if you ... you are a files dot com\nAnd there's a section ... first hand testimony to include alley abilities as manager\nAnd what information older reporters as well as myself have dug up on them\nAnd it's it's a crazy spy story and it changes because there's contradictory details because he just lied to everybody and it's classified information so it's hard to really get the full story but what I've been amazed by\nHow the U.S these bans in response to the upper over this vast vast majority have rejected the Islamophobia narrative there's really only a tiny minority on Twitter and social media are saying this was all Islamophobia stopped going after the guy because\nHe and cubby McCotter is fighting are Muslims I've only seen a few tweets about that and they're usually incoherent and and hard to understand and everyone else's\nTheir minds are being blown and all of a sudden you have all these people interested in [noise] grow through this intersection because it's really just like the most fascinating hottest group if that's the right word because they're a big threat but\nThey're also really weird and then more and more fans of you see a recovering outraged at the fact that there are all these ties between the big fighters and dictator of Chechnya and there's other reporters that outlined ties to other tyrannical government that they are helping to enrich [noise]\nHow they really tried to steer jihadism they try to add some marches influence into it and they also do this with Christianity as well but it was more fruitful in the Muslim world\nAnd they really try to amp up the hatred and then directed against Israel the United states\nThere were cards from the cage that came out that show that they had agents inside these groups that instead of dismantling them tried to basically take control of them and the dictator of Chechnya being a ... I think it's such proof of that because he's loyal to ...\nHe's being at your hardest\nAnd the only way that makes sense as a prudent wants to use your auditory his own purposes and you can't do it himself so he found a puppet\nAnd you talk to our families in Damascus and Aleppo in elsewhere and they'll tell you that a number of the jihad is on the Sunni side fighting with ISIS surgeon but most or otherwise\nFlowed right in the Assad regime let them come right into fight with ISIS because the more radicalized and food and was able to get rid of some of his radical Islamism Michael Weiss actually at the Daily Beast has a significant report about the the significant thousands of ISIS fighters that came from Chechnya\nAnd ultimately I think that speaks to the fact that um you know these guys in order to maintain tyranny and dictatorship beard and Russia being in Chechnya or Syria or will often fuel radicalization in order to legitimize dictatorship\nYeah for them for especially for those are the Cold War mine said there's no such thing really as a terrorist group or any independent military force it's all proxy so to them\nOr any type of force out there must either be conquered or controlled and it's all part of the bigger battle is just about the psychology of say\nA group like all over the Taliban are just independent radicals it's no you're always hold onto it for an hour and that's how the Russians things and one of the interesting things that happened that I think that you still has really figure it out\nIs that it's always theory was actually in Russian controlled territory of Pakistan in somewhere like Nineteen Ninety seven and was arrested and despite his name in it all the data bases as a top terrorists\nThey claim that they identified and recognize them and we all know what went on but he was held for several months and then just mysteriously released\nAnd then that's when bin Laden declared a war on America and made America the primary focus a key factor that later comes out and\nSays look I Know what went on because I Know what your case you the people that were all holdings always Uri and there was some sort of deal struck there was something going on and then to factor ended up getting poisoned and dying so\nHe obviously was saying that wasn't too fond of\nIn the last minute we have a Ryan do you think there's any hope for conservatives as far as the culture war goes and I know there's the domestic issues that we're going to talk about uh the cabinet appointments and others\nBut you know we look at and I may we look at W. W. E. and Saudi Arabia and yet the left through senior underground in others seem to continue to dominate the deflection there's a piece written about uh Thirty years after\nUm [noise] I'm On blasphemy laws since Nineteen Seventy nine or when uh the famous cartoonist who wrote the sea panic versus the author who wrote the sea versus basically now they say the the piece was called we're all ayatollah because the left doesn't want to criticize Islam no different than the ayatollah do\nThe conservatives have any chance and the culture war [noise]\nUh I don't think so and what they learn how to become cooler and and more attractive and not come off like\nPreaching fire British or to be honest with you the more the great got cell type build a quick audience\nIf they're funny and there are a little bit edgy and they don't come off uptight\nThan look at the current branch and things like that um will you know I can see why\nThanks a lot Ryan it's always great to have you God Bless them

his ground and now we have a deal\nOr we have a deal and it was good for the market as we saw today sparking some rally in the morning and um we saw auto manufacturers increase obviously are going up
