truly hate it gets lost in the shop it just gets it just becomes well\nI I think you're entirely correct and it's an extraordinarily important point it's the old story of crying wolf\nAnd it's why

they duct in in the van they were writing in and then finally they were able to drive a little bit out of harm's way\nI Do you know what amazes me about this poll is that is it's very much fits in with a I've gone back and looked at every deadly attack on a Jewish target\nIn the United states since Nineteen Seventy seven or so for the last forty years and but bless Italy there aren't that many of them\nAnd [noise] but most of the people who died in those attacks\nWere a Christian people who are caught in the crossfire or or even in the crossfire because mostly no one was firing back they were Christian people who were in some cases just wrongly targeted there was a ... a beautiful guy very devout a Christian and the son of a minister\nWho in April thirteenth two thousand fourteen he was killed by an anti Semite who was attacking the Jewish community center he just brought his grandson there and the grandson was killed two for a singing audition they were doing a program that the Jewish community center\nYeah well that's precisely what were we were worried about was them getting caught in the crossfire\nAlso to Michael I immediately thought of it because at first we didn't know who is doing the shooting right and so I thought okay what's that date\nOctober twenty seven twenty eight in the day before on friday and my Middle East politics class at grow City College we just finished teaching the Yom Kippur war of Nineteen Seventy three which it ended I think almost forty five years ago that day on Saturday\nSo I I immediately thought to myself I Wonder if this is a a radical she hottest attack and unfortunately it wasn't\nHad not had nothing to do with that but this was just some loan wacko\n... a Nazi apparently a who and I and and the worst thing about something like this is I don't know what you could even do to stop it other than\nBetter surveillance possibly I don't know who would do the survey and what I Would say this people listening\nIf you know somebody on Facebook or on social media who's posting vile hateful things like this and it was bragging about his weapons collection and and who's talking about maybe going down to the to the

Michael midday dot com\nAnd I should also noticed Brian did that uh the battle of New Orleans and the miraculous details concerning that battle also feature in my book the American miracle yeah the\nAh President Trump is restored Andrew Jackson's portrait to the White House and he clearly admires president Jackson I could President Trump for this moment in his presidency with all of its challenges could he learn something from Jackson's example\nI think so because Jackson was like LBJ LBJ was Jackson more where he said okay what do you need to get it done because you got to get what I Want done he heard a lot of deals with the Senate and leverage to leverage his power a gotten a lot of people face but in the end he got things done\nAnd he ... he turn the economy over to Martin Van Buren actually with a surplus and he was the last president to do to not have a devastating\nSo I think that he had to make some deals for that to the same time ah you know both to programs at all out of the country to grow\nAnd he understood the working class more than ... percent more than that it was more than my role for the Washington I'm you know more than John Quincy Adams says he was born leader remains an orphan and he understood he really thought a Midwestern badly south to the southwest was totally ignored\nSo I think that because Donald Trump constituencies that same morning proportion I didn't even go in Khartoum deals in order to have is greater objective for health and then see what happens after two years if you lose the house you don't see what happens after six years that we get the second time\nSo I think back to what they need to learn but the relentless the fighting spirit he's pretty much got that down\n[laughter] yeah he does um but Jackson or in in terms of his fighting spirit also had this great ability\nOf making up with people that he was fighting against the one point he had he had actually for a dual ... with a and been involved in a very bloody brawl with Thomas hard Benton the senator from Missouri who became one of his closest allies and he'll get his program through\nThat may be comparable to the Ted Cruz Donald Trump relationship\nAnd the Marco Rubio and Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham and the Nikki Haley\nA he has a lot of people that were critical okay I'm working with it by what they were were were willing to put

said you know the I Can't really go forward button up all these deals but then after a few months after talking to him he's now in in the beginning chocolate or you know\nI think I think the idea for

nonsense is Trump's anti Semitism was to blame or stoking of anti Semitic statement sores dog whistles\n[noise] I sure as hell hope at some point soon someone will stand up for the first amendment again and remind people the political speech is not to be blamed for the actions of a Mad Men are racist\n[noise] was Donald Trump to blame for the bomb threat the suspicious package mailer made and was convicted four and two thousand two\nOf course not and neither was anyone else\nBill Clinton was not responsible for the Oklahoma bombing any more than the rhetoric of rock Obama was responsible for Fort Hood if you want to talk policies that is a different thing\nBut the idea that fairly normal political speech can be the blame for the actions of the lunatic or racist is so far from our normal understanding of politics that it should be laughable\nUnfortunately it is not so who's rhetoric was to blame for Susan Collins having white powder mail to her office or the breaking into of Ted Cruz's officer the white powder mail to Donald Trump son and daughter in law with a note reading you get what you deserve\nI've been saying the idea that Trump calls some news fake news as an inspiration journalist site for violence is absolutely ridiculous since one was the word fake shouted or otherwise an incitement to anything from a nap to a half marathon\nOliver Wendell Holmes did not warn of the dangerous to and limits of free speech by denouncing the yelling of the word fake falsely in a crowded theater\nTo blame any violence on the use of the word fake is itself the theater of the absurd\nThough I Do understand how journalists wants to make themselves and their bravery and standing up to Donald Trump the story\nWhere were they when Barack Obama was actually wiretapping journalists well they'd been all over Brock Obama where he a Republican and we all know that but what violence to journalists in America has there been\nNone\nThe journalists need to go back and read their a soft fables starting with the boy who cried wolf\nDon't get me wrong there's been violence against journalists just known I can see attributed Trump the way journalists tried to bootstrap their case against him [noise] well I'm told south it's not just the fake news it's calling the press the enemy of the people okay I hear that a lot from Jim Acosta\nHe works for CNN [noise] where was he when CNN started the whole damn thing of making your political opponents your enemies\nI give you Anderson Cooper\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt said I ask you to judge me by the enemies I haven't may you may be more upset over your political career as a witch enemy or are you most proud of [noise]\nI guess the whole lobby I\nWorked hard for climate change and I want to work with the cola a foot in my time in the Senate tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide I'm proud to be a dodge cynical lobby governor O'Malley the national Rifle Association\n[noise]\nHealth insurance companies that drug companies\n[noise] hey rainy and [noise]\nProbably the Republican\nOr you go I Hope you noted what Hillary Clinton did with that not content with calling Republicans her enemies she put them in the same category as Iran the worst terrorist regime in the world so there you go to CNN starts it\nHilary makes it even worse and Donald Trump is to blame\nThese guys really do need to look in the mirror and then go read a First Amendment case and then maybe go read a book on hypocrisy and then maybe go read a book on American history if they can find one\nWhich gets us back to Pittsburgh it seems hardly enough for people to denounce anti Semitism\nBut as soon as Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton apologize for bills backslapping and sitting with Louis ... a month ago all start thinking the Democratic party for beginning to end its trafficking in it\nIt is a problem of the left generally these days just look at what goes on at our college campuses from UCLA\nTo overland what the toleration of and promotion of speakers who conflate Israel's policies with all Jews and have no problem hosting Hamas and Hezbollah apologist hell Columbia University brought in awkward dinner job to speak anyone remember that\nI had a friend emailed me of the day\nHe asked can you believe what's going on in this country what's happening to us well yes I can Hitler and not seeing them have been normalized and detoxify or they are now no worse than George Bush or Donald Trump to the left\nYou saw that and you see it today in their posters all the damned time at their protests have devoted a lot of words to the problem but we also need a little perspective to\nThis is not anything like some of our worst times we can find plenty of years much worse than this one\nNineteen sixty eight has known by some of us has an is horrible is not only did it feature the burning and riding the city's major cities in America a lot of bombings on college campuses but also the assassinations of Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy\nSome adults from that era told me there were serious question in their minds about whether America would survive literally survive a year [noise]\nOf course we have done and we've had worst fears as well cable news of course makes it worse not in stoking\nIt so much is heightening it no discrimination between the frivolous and the critical the important and the unimportant Russia's non collusion and Paul Manafort's non conviction for collusion in an election is as important to CNN as anything else including the synagogue bombing\nThat's how they survive keeping themselves necessary by making themselves important stoking Anita fake need\nTo need them to explain it all to us\nYet somehow someone going to seriously tell me we were less well informed as a people in Nineteen sixty eight\nI'll bet you on any possible index of knowledge sophistication air you diagnose being informed never mind educated we were much much much better in Nineteen sixty eight before cable or social media imagined that wonder why\nWhich gets us back to Pittsburgh again our hearts ache as they should at the shooting the death the massacre\nAnd why and how was the perpetrator not shot to death on the scene that would have been the most just of things and it would of course been what we would all have called a good shooting\nSays of course needs to be set it seems again and again not an anti Semitic or an anti Jewish country not any more than it is an anti Muslim country or an anti black country\nWe're the best country for all people everywhere just ask seven thousand Hondurans and we always have been\nAnd we should think our founders for that\nLet's all go back to our George Washington he set the standard for non bigotry and religious liberty here's what he wrote in his letter to the Rhode Island synagogue the first time the head of state we think ever wrote a positive note to a Jewish congregation\nIn it he said so much quote the citizens of the United states of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given demand kind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy a policy worthy of imitation all here possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship\nOr the agenda that seems to think Hillary Clinton should be the party spokesman once again because Elizabeth Warren has now no longer credible\nAnother boomerang that didn't work out for the left have you heard Hillary Clinton's latest this is what you get from the woman who said Donald Trump was not fit to be president before he was even sworn in [noise]\nHoney honey do you want to run again no [noise] no ties well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nTo the rest of course of the comments she made but no she doesn't want to run again she just wants to be president okay slip of the tongue OR Insight into her soul gone with the rest of the quote [noise]\nHopefully when we Abyei Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one there's going to be so much work to be done I mean we're going to see this everybody in the world including ourselves and\nWe're confused our friends and our enemies like they have no idea what the United States stands for what will likely to do what we think is important in\nA cell that work with the work that I feel very well prepared for having that in a sad for eight years having been a diplomat or in the state department and it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting are you going to get there in Dallas and failing oh I have no idea care\nBut okay so we go from no to a high of no idea and I'm not thinking about it all within a minute all within a minute\nShe doesn't know know then she recites her political resume to remind everyone why she would be so qualified from the Senate to being a diplomat\nKind of an interesting point she makes about our allies in a enemies have no idea what we stand for do you think that's right you think North Korea doesn't know what we stand for I think Iran doesn't know what we stand for I think they are less knew what we stood for during the ... years with the coddling we did of them\nDo you think our allies don't know what we stand for really I think they know a lot better what we stand for now\nThan we did under ... it was the president of Poland after all\nIn two thousand nine [noise] who said about Bach Brock Obama's European policies were going to have to start looking for new allies [noise] what a shame and what a quote to forget [noise]\nAnd what a sham Hillary Clinton those types of which will be Russia [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nNice sixty no\nCon male bombing suspects days are say off will remain behind bars for the findings she's accused of sending ... several high profile
