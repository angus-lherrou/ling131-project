Megan\nKelly dons this ah gets into this conference this morning she's already apologized\nUm one uh\nOne source at NBC says many seasoned journalists felt main goal his comments or an insult to the profession okay what happened is she is already apologized and do we have the text of the apology\nSomewhere here I'm In any event she regrets deeply and I think we can go on from that particular horror to um to more controversy\nAnd uh and and there's this um [noise] there's\nA great deal of controversy about Stacey Abrams who is a candidate for governor\nShe's the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and she's running as Brian Kemp who is the Republican is the state's secretary of state Stacey Abrams a state senator\nAnd a ... here here's the problem is a two fold problem one of the items that seems to me is more of a problem than the other\nAnd ah the one that's getting all the attention today is a CNN is reporting democratic candidate to be George next governor explained her presence Tuesday at a Nineteen Ninety to protest that included burning the state flag\nShe so that was part of her opposition to Confederate symbolism\nHer a\nInvolving came to light on social media\nAnd the state and into CNN Abrams campaign said that the actions in college were part of a permitted peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag it's part of Georgia State flag\nAs a time of the protest in Nineteen Ninety to the states flags states flag contained the Confederate battle flag emblem which had been a prominent feature say flags since it was a dump in Nineteen fifty six when the battle over the segregation was raging in the south\nOr the Confederate battle flag emblem wasn't fully recover removed from the states flag until two thousand three\nAnd then the same as in the\nUh Stacey Abrams campaign says during Stacey Abrams college years Georgia was at a crossroads struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues including symbols of the confederacy the sharpest of which was the inclusion of the Confederate emblem and the Georgia State flag\nThen it uh goes on to say a Bernstein in public service as deputy city attorney in a state legislative leader have all been focused on bringing people together to solve\nProblems uh okay the fact that back in Nineteen Ninety two she participated in a demonstration against the state flag\nThat's not a problem it seems to me and shouldn't be a big problem in our campaign it's a long time ago and the flag was changed anyway she's not burning the contemporary Georgia flag I'll tell you what is a problem\nShe has gone on record\nAnd she is standing by in about basically blowing up the largest Confederate monument of them all\nAnd this is one that I've spoken about this before on this whole issue of Confederate monuments\nI I Can't understand why you would decide not to blow anything up but to move a statue for instance the best example is in New Orleans\nThey had a statue of Robert easily on top of a pillar and it really looked over the whole city and it was sort of like the Nelson's statue on top of a pillar in ... square in Great Britain in London\nAnd having Robert de Leon such a prominent place looking over the whole city I get it problem\nDon't blow it up but they and I don't know what they're putting on top of that pillar of anything maybe that took the whole pillar down they move the least statue okay\nBut when you're talking about Stone Mountain I actually looked it up the Stone Mountain memorials bigger than Mount Rushmore and its carved into the side of a mountain the took about thirty\nYears to do all the carving it was a very very big undertaking\nAnd inner side of the mountain is an image of\nJefferson Davis president of the confederacy Robert The league commander of the army of northern Virginia and his chief lieutenant Thomas Jonathan Jackson's Stonewall Jackson and they're all riding along\nAnd Stacey Abrams is taken the position that event monument has to be removed and trashed and honestly I don't understand it\nThere are lots of African Americans in the state of Georgia so mountain by the way it's over three thousand acres of beautiful beautiful park and it is owned I'm pretty sure by the city of Atlanta is three thousand acres and their trails\nThey used to have a whole neo Confederate theme park is the New York times points out where they had a plantation house that's all gone\nIf they put up appropriate signage that looks at the side of this mountain as a historical symbol wouldn't that be a better way to go than simply San blasting it or ruining it are knocking it down and because of the size of Stone Mountain\nHe put in mind with the Taliban remember them\nThey blew up these Bhutto's because they took over the Buddhist were over twelve hundred years old\nAnd they blew them up in the ... valley and uh basically that was a ... that was before September eleventh and I went on the air and I talked about it and I said this is an act of terrorism against the past and\nLook I understand that you can move a statue but the notion that you have to blow up the whole mountainside\nIt's it's a little bit nutty\nIn ah the New York times they point out that the David Huckabee who is a Georgia syndicated columnist no relation to the White House press secretary assailed misery roast position writing that she intends\nTo run the most racist and divisive campaign history of Georgia politics removing such symbols won't keep one black father at home with his family didn't want to take a single illegal weapon off of a single street in a single black neighborhood\nAnd a ... ... ... look I I understand that the whole history behind the Stone Mountain monument is a a a it is a terrible thing because they started putting it up started plans for Nineteen fourteen and it was associated\nMonument in the middle of a city park well Nathan Bedford Forrest I think was just removed or is about to be removed from some um him and I believe in Memphis, Tennessee and Nathan Bedford Forrest was not only a Confederate general he was the founder of the Ku Klux Klan and so okay\nBut you see this mountainside is is different um\nAnd it it's different because this is like Mount Rushmore it was a work of art it was a public project and I think it's perfect\nThe appropriate would signage around it reminding people of everything that you said that ah these are people who fought against the United states\nAnd in context of this entire monument was put up\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case but we're very different place in our country right now\nBut to literally blast away this three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain\nAnd the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there in a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's a needlessly polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the ... amendment show hey\n[noise] my garden on well I've heard your weight or were you made it I can listen to your explanation about again\nOkay miners are filled with their heritage\nNo no I never say never say that this is their heritage I never say that they cause a heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay but here in the outfits you find so beautiful historical and all that how would you feel if there was a Stone Mountain Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer and all that they don't they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that their heritage\nBut again and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage and that's not the point the point is if there was if there is an art work a piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move aid three acres culture that it took Thirty years to make you only blow it up\nOr if there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that outfits should be blown up\nI think it's important that it be preserved date is part of the record of history\nAnd they didn't have any statues and our ships but if they had them there that should be preserved is part of the historical record as well and given the fact that ah they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place I was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house what Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it any more they just have T shirt say so mountains\nAnd or should it have anything inside it I've met some people yes Confederate souvenirs no of course not because you're right this is a dark chapter of American history is not one to be celebrated\nBut that doesn't mean it seems to me following the Taliban example of blowing up monuments from a different era we will be right back on the show\nNine sixty no\nRush of violations of a nuclear missile treaty run long

well good um I don't want to make a comment on the conversation about mountain Georgia yeah when I was a child we lived in Georgia her fixed it fixed at Seventy two I went to come out with several times have very fond memories of the park\nBig change that you're going to bring representing Washington in January of next year to what Maria Cantwell has been\nDoing we're not doing for these last sixteen years the last what twenty four years\nWell she's been in public office she's twenty five years I had a congressman before and Twenty years in federal office so this is her six federal race or election I should say\nBut um what what I think it's going to happen if the people around the country are going to realize that this is not a deep blue state and people believe\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P A state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and and\nMeant by the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race\nOr that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so what would you change one seed there and then makes a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead\nIs on it lately right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot\nOr that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists [noise]\nThey don't want this new vision that has been so articulated by the Seattle's city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about that head tax that they pass and ah we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off because they couldn't afford to pay that hadn't tax to the city\nAnd that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with and and\nYour opponent is on record of wanting higher tax rates\nAbsolutely and she voted against the tax cuts in jobs bill she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attack they don't love it's another way to get people's money and the people in this country are seeing a new way and that thanks to Donald Trump kind of doing with his policies out what hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly live\nIn our state and across the country that unemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities and um\nI again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three\nFull terms in the U.S Senate um what's ... what would be your first priority if you actually won this thing\nWell we have a lot of priorities in this state and a lot of people may not realize that we were inundated with for its fire smoke based on very bad policy if they keep us from clearing out the under brash and getting rid of that hinder\nA that's ready to explode the moment there's a forest fire we have had catastrophic forest fires\nIn our federal for us and that's got to change and that's one of the first things I Would do another thing is we are really hurting when it comes to transportation because our state is so a\nPoorly respected in the halls of power we have very little cloud to bring home any kind of money from the federal government and I said I can bring home that the federal dollars for infrastructure that my opponent has been unable to do was harshly\n'cause he can work with the trumpet ... and and but also partially because I think you share with the Trump Administration to desire to move us to fixing our roads rather than building new ... trains as our friend taught her mentor first of them yes uh that actually go nowhere\nExactly you know we're on the cusp of a very exciting time in transportation a cleaner cars and and the ability to use a a phone app to find a drivers and writers in order to a double and triple up in car pools like we'd never seen before you know kind of an ... like\nVersion of transportation for the commute and there are so many new innovative things that are coming down the road it's just a shame to use the phrase it's just a shame that we spend so much time wasting billions of dollars on a\nOn not getting our folks to and from work and back home to visit with their families for the rest of the day so I'm I feel very strongly about that there's there's another thing that really affects all of that and this is nationwide it's bringing down the cost of higher education\nAnd we know the federal government has had a major role in increasing those costs and uh we've got to step in the time has come and it's an issue that I think all of that around the country are going to be working on\nAnd what are what are some of the promising ways you could bring down the ridiculous cost of higher education well the\nThe biggest one is that a federal use of of loans uh that has allowed the costs at the university is to go skyrocketing no of\nCourse with the federal government under writing all all of these loans including for people who just go for a year or two and don't even have a college degree to show for it we're speaking with Susan Hutchison\nShe is a

ayatollah or ... or the sheer Assad or just say that the person was acting terribly or dictatorial e y the stampede to Hitler\nBut I pointed out to my friend this is what the left has done to us they have totally ... fused every conversation of dissent and disagreement into a reduction or a duck geo at Hitler um everything negative is immediately Hitler\nWell of course it is and George Bush wasn't Hitler as so many protesters claimed and depicted and Donald Trump isn't Hitler as so many protesters claim and to ... today\nNeither were they or are they fascists or Nazis and it is a terrible horrible thing to claim into picked such in some if Donald Trump or George Bush were Hitler anything within light years\nOf him I Know of some several tens of millions of people who would not have

see what happens when you save one life\n[noise] now there's a lot to all of this ... at Hitler on business\nIt's not just that it's an immediate and abbreviated Russia's slider stampede on the spectrum of evil from not so great or I voted for the other guy or the other gal\nTo one of the worst human beings the history of the world has ever known perspective is crucial but\nThat's not the worst of the problem the worst of it as far as many more layers\nFirst their entire generations to come and some exist now who actually don't know what or who Hitler meant or\nWas we tell them well think George Bush or Donald Trump and then take a moment and think about that disservice to intelligence much less any knowledge whatsoever\nBut to where they're not certain lessons we were to learn from the rise of Hitler the empowerment of Hitler the appeasing of him the un actions in confronting him all that goes out the window with these analogies\nThen there's the insult to history as well as the insult to so so so many families who suffered and still given losses and punishments suffer from him to this day it\nIs in other words not just wrong to engage in ruddock deal at Hitler um it is an actual indirect insult to millions and millions of people it's also an insult to our Republican form of government or fellow countrymen but\nThose who fought Hitler and those who voted for the person you call him you cannot claim to love this country if you so hate your countrymen that you are willing to call them enablers of or voters of much less supporters\nOf Adolf Hitler this was David go learn there's point yesterday about the left and the tape for America it may seem subtle the times but it's right there\nYou cannot love your country and hated people for our country is not just physical land and monuments and oceans in fact really who cares about any of that when you think about it\nOur country's founding document did not begin saying the Grand Canyon in the Shenandoah River hold true to to be self evident\nThe country did not found itself with a governing document with the notion that we the wheat fields and the Mississippi River river in order to form a more perfect union\nNo both ways from the declaration of independence of the constitution were about people and the same people\nUnder the root of lesson from us all being created equal informing governments based\nOn the consent of the government so we all get a say in a vote in our leadership and that we take turns in that governing and that we don't always get the leadership we want and so we have elections and choice\nRemember the first thought in the federalist papers Alexander Hamilton put it right there for us quote\nIt has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved the people in this country by their conduct an example\nTo decide the important question whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice or whether they are for ever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force\nWell can we do this reflection and choice\nThat is why we have elections and free speech and free press and free assembly isn't it\nWhich is why I keep saying if you want analogs to tyranny or autocracy or fascism or communism if that's your bag if those are the analogies you want to run to who just two is doing the shutting down of speech and press and assembly these days\nWhat leftist or liberal needs a security guard when it gives a speech on a college campus and what leftist or liberal was ever banned from speaking at a college campus\nBut below conservative heck even one with tremendous credentials you get banned forbidden have Britain brats thrown at you end up in a hospital but one thing you definitely need as every conservative college organization knows is security\nWho in other words is really acting out the part of the brown shirts these days\nWhat side more who is getting band on social media liberals leftists Farah can oh no here\nSharpton and Jackson and Clinton paddling around from a month ago as full moon get formulating against Jews quite openly thank you and on Twitter\nAnd we're as art representation in the major media doesn't exist and that's fine because we actually respect and support private enterprise and property but\nLet's not go around selling a fiction that Trump or conservatives are curbing freedoms\nDemocracy or anything like that never has the left been more loud and more free to be so loud so if we may some perspective please\nMany of us lament the election cycle and all the continuous adds we see for about two months every other year or so it's okay for me it's fine there's nothing more important in our society than politics and how we choose who we choose with our best reflection and choice\nTrust me we throw a lot more money in advertising in the far less serious things from sports to movies hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars more\nAnd maybe that's what we want less serious things I get that we ... we like our leisure we like our relaxation\nBut if you're going to enter the serious and important field of politics even temporarily and engage a political republic policy discussion stopped with the an apt\nWrong insulting heartless stupid and hateful comparisons and analogs to Adolf Hitler\nIt shows your total idiocy\nAnd we have simply too much of that already\n[noise] I'm Seth Leibsohn Tuesday October twenty thirty two thousand Eighteen the lines are open six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero [noise] I have a question about this song raised when we come back and we will be right back\nYou and I use the word evil a lot of people will say mad man I don't I don't know I think that takes away moral responsibility I think it's an evil leader\nWell that's true or however this is the whole idea of our phone backing up now that you've said that let's back up to the what our founding fathers the whole idea of ... we I'm behind or represent ... democracy or or republic is the fact that\nBy ... by dispersing power and guard jamming everything up and dispersing things the state dispersing in among different areas of the government you take away the possibility\nOf having an evil individual they actually knew the nature of man was to centralize\nPower for their own sake and then it with their you know knowing the flaws of man that the person that evil would tend to\n... absolutely I absolutely dug but I also think it's true\nUm that along with that\nWas the enshrine ing of uh the natural law of the universe into our founding document totally\nTotally so the reason I'm bringing all this up is to what eleven does is it curves Vert things for their own use it pervert it totally Nazis or the national socialist party were right socialist it\nWas a centrally controlled you know Hitler could not ... you know I'm an atheist power and destruction if it wasn't a centrally controlled government and and so one that left uses that it's trying to demean everybody else and it just throws that Iran but we have to work at\nThat point to and and I didn't say that it is as well as you did in my monologue but I meant it when they do invoke these analogs they're criticizing their fellow Americans and their fellow countrymen as us their country\nBecause when you think of this here's the irony they're using the idea there invoking\nA socialist Nazi is a form of socialism to describe a party that wants to dismantle central power and disperse it more freedom to the individual in the state and\nIt's it's totally opposite we want to dismantle power how can you be a ... year olds want power if your ... your goal is to dismantle\nYou know it's funny one of the worst off to a rhetorical for lack of a better word crimes are assaults on the sensibilities and one of the worst first assaults on the sensibilities of the left but upset the left so much was when Ronald Reagan in his first inaugural address talked about limiting government and government being the problem\nIs you know hey why not over the hey Doug I got to go to a break in and of course yes You're welcome to stay or not all be guided by whether you stay or not OK\nOkay opposite [laughter] I'm Seth leaves and we'll be right back I didn't get to my
