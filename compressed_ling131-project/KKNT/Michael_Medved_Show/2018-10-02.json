... with a slender so let's get as much as you said the guys that go up\nBecause it couldn't prevail ...\nIt for the for the very reason ... this whole world that we're living in is nobody knows there's no certainty that that's why there's no corroborating evidence of a doctor Ford's claim 'cause we don't know nobody knows nobody says\nThe flip side of that coin is in order to have something actionable in court to just say that but even some of the lesser accusers ms sweat neck or something like that to to to nail her properly on slander you've really got to prove the fall sort of something\nAnd that's pretty impossible so it's it's the logical coin if you want to use that\nThe ads the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence and other words there's no evidence that actually happened that doesn't mean that it's proven that it did not and you kind of need that for a for for slander finding\nOr any other real reason is that all judge capital wants to do is get on

do they get on\nA case like Martin ... and everybody thinks he is either a ... yeah he did get caught for Ohio jobs they took him to court and they won a and he did ask\nMe if I were to cares about\nThat one couldn't find anything about it and if you go you know anything about it in and\nAround and no and no one no one is going to care what they are going to care about is what the ideas that a Jeff Flake or a John Case it would bring to a presidential race I think they would have strong appeal for Trump haters\nThey have strong appeal for people for whom the president's conservative governance is a little too spicy to sort of a center right a moderate issue voter that that is a voting bloc I think there that that that both Jeff Flake and John ... fan base not nearly as big as your shirt\nI felt very badly for but she has already herself and of course ... ... a senator chance I think that we're\nAlready and I think that was banned me could be that the exactly what they did

hey it's our final hour together until it's time for me to roll back in the air and and feel and there's always a joy everybody Mark Davis from six sixty am the answer Dallas Fort Worth polls well with you\nAnd if if you want to just to hang in my world a little bit on your free time Twitter is at Martin Davis about radio station is six sixty a unanswered dot com you see what I'm bladder and about on my own time here in the morning show that I Do\nAnd if it occurs to you hey has this guy written a book holy cow yes I have a couple of them in fact there was another checking me about it now [noise] ah there was one in twenty fourteen because people are regulatory\nEr which we now own which is funny I I wrote a book for regular Yemen Salem Media group buys rag nice oh that's a good book to be able to have\nA little single Lone Star America how Texas can save our country the idea we're all in the uh the purgatory it'd be Obama years\nAnd the ... and my thought was hey if if the entire country was run more like Texas we'd be a lot better off and you know what lately looks like we're kind of doing that so that proved not want to say prophetic joined us hopefully with sensible that's Lone Star America from twenty fourteenth then in twenty six team in the election year\nIt occurred to me to do about a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty some talk show topics of of subjects that the left has been getting away with like guns are bad\nHuman productivity has definitely warming the planet the constitution as a shape bubble malleable living breathing documents and other nonsense and and just a way chapter by chapter to gently McCain maybe not so gently but at least civil ally and constructively push back against that\nAnd I put it together in a little thing called upside down how the left turn right into wrong truth and allies in good and bad\nThat's a lot of subtitle just to Mark Davis upside down on a Google or Amazon or Barnes and noble or whatever and then there's the book and the hope you enjoy it\nAll right so the last gentleman\nAnd they took it will altogether was talking about how about about Supreme Court justices and boy you could say we've been talking about Supreme Court justice is a lot lately [noise] um\nAnd how it's so important and powerful because it's a lifetime appointment and the gentleman said it's not a lifetime appointment as a yes\nIt is but I kinda got his point article ... section one judicial branch beautiful pop judicial powers it's easy for you to say\nI'm the judges of the Supreme and inferior records show hold their offices during good behavior\n[noise] so I don't really know what he was getting it if it seems like there were things that there were offenses that a lot like maybe ... deciding wrongly in roe v Wade should have gotten a few justice is just tossed out onto the curb [laughter] okay\nUm [noise] it's a lifetime of more than a ... barring impeachment and and that gets ... eat so ah ... what led to do here is if they are there are two things that people have talked about term limits and age limits\nThe get\nThe more unfair age limits scenes [laughter] 'cause I'm sixty and I'd like to think I'll be around for a couple of do three more decades and uh and I I Know a ton of people\nWho are sharpest attacks smart as a whip strong as of rocks they're eighty five I also do some people who are forty ... total idiots so um [noise] it just seems ... wildly arbitrary no term limits\nTerm limits boil down to one thing turn over for the sake of turnover [noise] I think the founding fathers envisioned a I'm a citizen legislature but you know uh\nThey didn't put term limits in there I guess they left that up to us well we finally did it uh for the presidency FDR was president for thirty seven years or [laughter] or do I do a\nAnd M. twelve or Thirteen but we didn't we did that\nAnd I guess I did that [laughter] but I think we're probably all on board for presidential term limits turnover for the sake of turnover especially these days seems like a good idea\nUh everybody talks about term limits in Congress oh we we well I can fill up the lines right everybody just banging on the table for term limits here's the dirty little secret you're already\nNot enough people on them oh you do I do\nYour friends do the people you're hanging out with do I can fill you know forty seven hours of talk shows that people who do\nYou know what if everybody was so good data about term limits we'd had him a long time ago so ... is the bottom line of duty already been the dirty little secret we liked the idea\nOf term limits it sounds great but then when you realize that that means you got to get rid of your congressman\nJust to be under twelve years and it's usually the deal is six terms in the house two terms in the Senate both equally twelve years but that means you you know what I mean I got to get rid of Ted Cruz after one more term I don't want to get rid of Ted Cruz every one more\nTerm oh I Want to I Want I Want to prove to be a senator Jill you're Ninety three\nSo that's why I term limits never goes anywhere is a bit every day in and it just shows in the polling approval ratings of Congress are terrible for approval ratings of people talking about their congressmen tend to be pretty good\nSo everybody else should have to get rid of their cars and you don't want to get re yard bears so there's the whole cut on room of term limits so at at the judiciary level I mean what are we going to I'm a ... Thirty years Twenty years I don't know\nI don't know um [noise] I guess I'm really thought about it that much turnover for the sake of ... [noise] I tell you what I Would sure make 'em as if this is even possible that would make elections more interesting wouldn't it can you measure the election coming up on an election in a given year\nAnd they're like three justices about to get term limited out for the very next president oh my heaven is\nIs that his gut wrenching tension I don't know maybe we got the best of they've got the best system right now as horribly flawed as it is okay speaking of horribly flawed here some Hillary audio um do bless their hearts\nYeah I I'm In the process of forgetting Hillary was ever born she's never going to be president I'm just over it you know there have been prior to lock her up prosecuting your grade if somebody wants to do that\nLord knows it seems appropriate and view them be obvious which in handling of\nNational security materials but even even as I put those set and just together my brain starts to leak out of my ears and I think about both Clintons about the same way just go away just be an private life kind of like the Obamas are\nUh just just do be in private life and be happy and prosperous I don't care you can't screw up life anymore and I'm by moving on from you [laughter]\nI'm here [laughter] I've never get that out of my head I get scrubbed my brain of that but uh but here's a here's a little more Hillary audio because they asked her oh and here's a real suspenseful question\nHey what did you think of that Dr Ford testimony and her reply was Des\nMoines you feel a hundred percent certain of the events that she describes a a\nR true and are there weren't as qualified but I I watch as much of her testimony as I could\nFound her very credible\nYou have to ask yourself why would anybody put themselves through this if they did not believe that they had important information or to convey to the Senate she basically said that she thought it was her civic duty uh so I found I found her presentation I found her a\nWillingness to say I don't remember that but I remember there\nAre to be a very convincing and I\nSell grain swell or [noise]\nThat she would be willing to put herself out there\n[noise] [noise] pride let's spend a moment on pride ... the\nThe only reason to be proud to Dr Ford is too because you one thousand percent believe her by the way I'm not suggesting anybody should be ragged on Dr Ford but when people talked about her courage her bravery and I I mean I I think most fair minded\nCoherent human beings thinks something happened to her but they just don't think it was a red Kevin on the deck\nAnd and so do you lose courage points if you screwed up the identity of the suspect I don't know I Wish her well I Wish Dr Ford well I've got nothing nothing nothing against her [noise]\nMan out of ... just Trump change that for everybody but it is it is great if Mitch McConnell's never been better he's great we're going to hear from him and just to say there's a piece of audio from him it's fantastic\nAnd uh and and and and Ted Cruz is going to be an important part of the push to getting a judge Kavanaugh turned into justice Kavanaugh and and and and I've told a local audience after that all happens\nAfter justice Kavanaugh's for now the Supreme Court yeah then somebody double back to me please circle back to me and tell me how Bayh though is up by one in Texas\nRight so there's your a cruise overarching campaign to up to you know having a vote Mitch lifted him can you can you find out what else can we put that uh [noise] but I'm the undead circle because as you might have heard the New York times has come up with another blockbuster oh my gosh I'm bombshell\nWho my heavens there's been a lot of charges and a lot of them involve just terrible things well this one tears it I got to tell you what I can do about this one in Nineteen eighty\nFive and a bar Brett Kavanaugh through I had a guy [noise]\nI Know I knew this day would come there on science turned them and then the Cape shouldn't be talking about this but Mitch McConnell at a word or two or three about it and roll Mitch\nClass size than there are times outlandish this major shoring up the\nJudge Kavanaugh may have

about these new developments that we found out overnight if police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualify for someone that's in a Supreme Court slightly\nIn the eye of the nation because there are a lot of allegations and part of LA are about how he behaves plenty is talk\nSo that is very relevant and trail\nOf himself as tactically choir boy a very much contradicted by his his roommate for example and college and some people who knew him in high school why we need an FBI and the nationwide calling for one for what seems like mind [noise]\n[noise] you know this is a good time for me to say something there are Democrats who I think are wrong about everything but\nYou may have a certain ... of job I can be bad I almost can't not like the guy you know or maybe club which are I think is of um acquitted herself with a ... with some degree of\nOf rationality and decency I'm no I've I've lived there ... there are plenty of Democrats about whom all I Would say is I disagree with you about everything\nMazie Hirono is it in Paris bench\nIf somebody asked her the stupid ice questions like well that's why we need it FBI investigation this is relevant\nOh and by the way that goes back to the moral precept\nOf that I wanted to touch on in the last hour this really is important because it's all about you know the constitution Supreme Court and judge Kavanaugh and and the smear campaign against him and et cetera et cetera but of all the lessons that I Hope to come away with\nThat are ideally taught and taught well an taught broadly please\nLet us all move forward with the following moral absolute no\nDecent society stains and cars a human being in his or her fifties because of stuff that person was doing as a teenager\nNo one does that no one does that\nAnd Democrats or a funny lot here in my state of Texas Democrats me for it yet to forget ...

I Hope that they're not just banking everything on the FBI before there's enough evidence\nOf a pattern of decision making not to mention is very expansive view of a presidential protection because he has the the only one who wrote that the President Bush in the mail and found any kind of coming I'll settle for ... I'm sure this president really paid a lot of attention to those you\nKnow but he did that I did too and everybody should because guess what he's right and I and\nAnd listen I you know don't drive the car if the road if Hillary had one evening sorry if Hillary and one I don't think\nThat she should be ... you you\nCan't be her either I don't think you can be subpoenaed lane or even dialing sitting president said that that just puts too much power in the hands of some\nLocal yoga da ... now the president will dig me the solution for punishing a president for wrongdoing is one thing\nIn each but that's it so if that's judge Kavanaugh's view it's not because of you know you love Trump but if if if he's around long enough and if Trump as a Democrat successor God help us do feel the same way about uh about that president to [noise] All right so we\nWe we reached close to the end of the line so let's do let us a pledge come back for a couple of final moments together [noise] and I have um some ideas marinating on how I think\nThe rest of this week may go and ultimately I don't know but I'm just seeing some things in their mid we've been told some things on today's show I Will refresher memory on some of those er or shared details on that\nAnd then I'll get outta here and make room for Michael to return to the show that bears his day he'll be back tomorrow I'm Mark Davis in from Michael in tobacco about three minutes\n\n\nI'm so mark and hear some of my work you know one of the biggest outrageous I reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit talk now and how the woman goes into it when it comes out of there is no police report and I helped get both the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions correctly from governor in his office not to ...\nWhen the producers of the gods now movie came to me for him I jumped in the channel I personally donated to\nMake sure that film got Maine got no movie opens you open your mouth amazing\nCormac God's mill is perhaps the most ... an American is dean king and the entire kept her job bringing however touring the evil queen's nothing that\nMan did attack Clinton for children and you don't have to be a problem I have to see you\n... will be moving to carry the mother of two I promise you can and should bring your teenage children bring friends and family not want to pass a unique opportunity changes hearts and minds about abortion guns\nNo rated PG Thirteen do you have type one or type two diabetes\nIs your stomach full after just a few bites argue overwhelmed by nacho vomiting and abdominal pain you may be suffering from diabetic gastro ... doctors are looking for volunteers for an important research study evaluating and investigation on drug for these symptoms go to my stomach study dot com to see if you qualify\nYou must be at least Eighteen years old have type one or type two diabetes\nAnd have experienced some or all of these symptoms for at least three months study related drugs doctor visits and test will be provided to you at no cost\nCompensation for time travel may be available for qualified participants\nFor more information and and see if you qualify call for a zero seven one to six to six one or visit my stomach study dot com that's for a zero seven one to six to six one or visit my stomach study dot com called today for a zero seven one to six to six one\nMy stomach study dot com [noise]\nI Can't believe the holidays are almost here again well that's not all\nThe time to review our Medicare plan and see what changes are coming in twenty Nineteen\nNow not that again that eight hundred number we call for help last year was so confusing and I don't have time to attend all the meetings\nNot too worried this year we're calling Tina T R B insurance service Tina and her team will meet with us answer our questions explain her options and help us make changes if necessary the T R B team is how some people with Medicare and Arizona for over a Nineteen year NPR be insurance isn't a plus rating with the better Business Bureau\nYou're saying they will actually meet with us and help us Sarah ...

Petty as we are getting ready to\nHit the road here and welcome Michael back to his own show\n[noise]\nFrom policy to culture principles to politics [noise] this is the leaves and show [noise] walk it back to the\nSilver second two thousand Eighteen maybe I should walking myself back I Want to thank Dr gesture for manning the helm here yesterday's\nA great friend and did a great job as I like to a tease him he can do my job I just can't do his that's really are only difference that plus his lack of el ...\nAnd my struggle with it I'll get back to Kevin ... in a moment but first I'd like to share something I've been thinking about that the last few weeks have put me in mind of let me start as I think we all should start\nWhen we are talking of politics from the beginning or the basics in our case that's almost always going to be Aristotle the first political scientist in his book on politics he set of man quote the man is more of a political animal the bees or any other gregarious animals is evident\nNature as we often say makes nothing in vain and man is the only animal she is in doubt with the gift of speech and whereas mirror voices but an indication of pleasure or pain and his therefore found in other animals for their nature changed the perception of pleasure and pain in the intimation of them to one another and no further\nThe power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and in expedient and therefore likewise the just and unjust\nEnded his characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil of just an unjust and the like and the associations of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state close quote\nIn other words for Aristotle and for most of our understanding certainly in the human world than most certainly in America where we begin with the understanding that we do not live under animals we don't give animals vote that cannot hold property that cannot represent us\nThat we are to act and can only act as humans can and do act in a way that distinguishes humans from animals\nThat is with a sense of things like justice in injustice good and evil and we create our policies or state Sen rules and laws all around those concepts and protections\nOf course a lecture for another day is part and parcel of this but it is about evil regimes that relegate some humans to unequal positions or treat them as animals\nBut for now stick with me for a civil society we all have to have a basic understanding and appreciation of things like justice good evil means er proportion what Aristotle calls expediency inexperience\nWe see this to in his book on the ethics\nBear with me there's a lot packed in this hopefully I and I think it will make some sense\nHe writes Aristotle writes quote now each man judges well the things he knows and all of these he is a good judge and so the man who has been educated in the subject is a good judge of that subject and the man who has received an all round education is a good judge in general\nHence a young man is not a proper here of lectures on political science for he is inexperienced and the actions that occur in life\nBut it sticks but its discussions start from these and are about these and furthers she tends to follow his passion is his study will be vain and unprofitable because the end aimed at is not knowledge\nBut action and it makes no difference whether he is a young in years or youthful and character defect does not depend on time but on his living and pursuing each successive object as passion directs\nFor to such persons as to the incontinent knowledge brings no profit but to those who desire and act in accordance with a rational principle keep in mind knowledge about such matters will be of great benefit close quote\nWe can come back to Arrested Development and a bit if we like but the basic point here is that we're to act rationally and mature early and not like children who are all action and recreation and little deep thought right so far so good [noise]\nOkay but now here is what I Wonder about we've had discussions here on the show of late of the things like the George Orwell quote that we reached such a point in our culture that the first task of the educated man is to restate the obvious\nMany of us think we have simply lost basic notions of right and wrong of justice and injustice support you might just called the building blocks of society you know things like not just innocent until proven guilty but why a civilized society puts importance on such things as innocent until proven guilty\nNot just a right to life but why there is an inherent right to life not just one handing eh not one not just one having the freedom of speech but why we have freedom of speech not just that you have a right to swing your fist up to the point in my nose but why is that right is inherent\nNot just that you have a right to your property and to create your own property but why does writes in here why they are writes\nI happen to think of all of a I I happen to think of all of that needs to be teaching and that we simply don't teach it any more we've lost our basics\nWhich is why I think we are so so divided over so much smaller issues but the kinds of issues that affect affect us every single day especially in our politics I think about it and maybe this gets us to why there is a cultural political civil war of sorts along the lines were tennis Prager keep speaking about\nBut let's think about this for a second\nThere really is a tremendously huge divide and a lot of issues where particularly the left has no understanding of the idea of uncertainty or what I Am going to call the political uncertainty principle that is to say there was a self righteousness about their ... and a complete disbelief\nAnd not just what we believe but that we can even believe such things try it for a leftist to disagree with us on school choice or charter schools\nThey are not just concerned or have room for reform in mind for those things and they don't just disagree with us they absolutely cannot believe we believe in them\nAnd they absolutely cannot see white anything but traditional public schools and only traditional public schools should or can exist\n[noise] take prayer and faith many of you have seen or heard about this cartoon from an Illinois newspaper making fun of Brett Kavanaugh starter for ...\nThe cartoonist is one of millions in America that simply could not resonate to Brett's story of his daughter praying for his accuser or understanding prayer at all or that some people really do pray and really do need it they have no understanding of takes the life issue\nThere are to be as charitable to a position I don't agree with as I can beat two countervailing claims one is based on a former version of justice and one is based on a fundamental claim of human rights life\nBut for the most part the pro choice or pro abortion crowd simply thinks the evil is on the pro life side\nIf I were wrong about perspectives are white on this they're simply would not be as much abortion is there is my point I think pro lifers understand the pro choice or pro abortion argument\nThey simply on the other side do not understand ours or understand how we can even believe in it it's almost a face to them\nI could go on and on take racial preferences last example same thing\nWe will understand the reason for race preferences we also by and large thinks think it's a violation of everything this country was founded on\nWhat we fought a civil war over and the purposes of civil rights as originally understood in the modern era ... convincing about in the Nineteen fifties and culminating in the civil rights accept the Nineteen sixties\nBut the pro racial preference crowd thinks we are evil they simply do not understand how we can believe what we believe\nOn all of the above and more they are indignant and angry and debate about any of these issues if they debate him which I'm part explains the sensor ship we see being on college campuses by faculty by supposedly learned or adults and certainly throughout social media\nIn other words there was a terrible divide in our country and it helps explain the two sides that have been so ribs and over the Kavanaugh hearings\nI may be for the first time in ... in my life simply cannot see and do not see the other side of things here\nNo witnesses proposed witnesses who disagree with the accuser accusers who have all changed their stories over time an exemplary life a record of public elevation not neutrality but elevation beyond others compare a professional woman into the workforce and the notion that and accused there has to be believed\nBefore the accused on the ... and most last minutes of evidence is I simply do not understand it I don't and I confess and ignorance I did not know I had\nBut as I Confess that\nI Will also say this one side here is wrong simply wrong and time will bear that out in the certainty that many of us already believe exists will there be an accounting of that wrong will there be an apology I doubt it\nWhat self respecting news ... news organization would then go with the story\nThe\nPoint of a news organization we have been told for years and years we may have to take a pause before we get this interview but the point of news we have been told for years and years and I remember this well with the advent of the Drudge Report and all kinds of blogs and all kinds of social media the mainstream media says\nAre not in the same business as they are that mainstream media has says do not deserve the protection the traditional reporters deserve\nThat mainstream media has said well because we vet stories and we added ... research and we have lots of employees and lots of journalists investigating we know how to investigate and we know how to edit\nThat's why we're in a different place than the blogs that is why we're in a different place than say talk radio that's why we're in a different place than social media well if that's true\nWhat the heck is the point of investigation and editing if they're going to go ahead and put out an interview with someone whose story they cannot corroborate about a person they can't be sure was there isn't that the point of all the editing and isn't that the point of all the\nMachinations to goose go through to get a story to the public isn't that the point of it\nCan't corroborate any of the claims does that mean now we are in a free for all where anyone anyone\nI suppose if there are of the right politics or perhaps the right gender can make a claim to mainstream media\nFor a political purpose obviously for a political cause and the media will do its checks they'll run through you know the uh the standardized hoops that they tell us they are so good at but even if they can't complete them they'll just throw out the story anyway\nThey're no better than anyone else with a computer and a modem as judge once said\nNo better than anyone else with a laptop and a modem as he said at the national press club in Ninety eight they guaranteed us they were better because they had filters and they had sisters and they had professionalism and they had training\nWhile they don't or they do it just won't matter it just won't amount to anything [noise] All right do we have time to just play some of this play the beginning of Kate Snow introduction this is worth listening to go ahead\nAnd say what we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story our reporting we want to be very transparent because these are very serious allegation Kavanaugh\nHas called Julie sweating story nonsense and as far as the president today question her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her class there was that shit okay\nWhat's the point of the story then what is the point of journalism then what is the point of investigation what is the point of editing what is the point of journalistic judgment if you can't confirm anything they're saying and\nRemember this is not about someone who ran over a pigeon or a rabbit this is not about someone who swung the golf club in of the ball went into another person's window and the flood the scene this is not about even a a fender bender fleeing of the ... [noise]\nThis is about ... great as you'll hear I Want to do an economy and culture check with John dumb rescue first but we're going to get into this and we're getting going to get into this some deeper and deeper level then I also got to tell you about how the media is missed reporting on the teeth Allison investigation here's various we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise] with\nSri News I'm Keith leaders in Washington Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell accused Democrats on Tuesday of opening the floodgates of mud and mock against Brett Kavanaugh as Republicans sought to portray efforts to derail the Supreme Court nominee over accusations of sexual assault in the Nineteen eighties as the politics of personal destruction\nPresident Trump told reporters on the White House lawn that he still supports Kevin all but said it's a scary time for a young man who could become the object of false accusations he suggested it was troubling that people were automatically found guilty
