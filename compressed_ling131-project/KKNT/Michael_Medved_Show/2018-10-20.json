Creighton University the shows that when you get your level of fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that need to do and it begins the story a little bit of the vitamin D so if your level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to\nThink of vitamin D as a mountain spring with a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about it calcium and bone\nAnd we've taken enough item and data halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other pools below with the breath pool the colon pool the immune system poll all the other polls that are blow it have been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the pancreas out all these pool\nAnd there's enough left over to store\nA little bit for a rainy day and a little bit of a surplus yet but you don't do that unless you're levels around\nBy the way down to ...

supplies and all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred\nSix five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero now doctors now talk to me about the link between vitamin D and body weight what's the research showing\nWell that is maybe fifty studies out there that show a real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D ... but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues think lose that we know what about mood that is\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitude so those were closed\nBut we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level if so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ...\nThat's become clear just recently for example that a paper in the British Journal of nutrition they studied women who were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and takes lost more weight than the women who had the lower vitamin D and take yes\nAnd then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial is the highest standard of proof we have and that is and this was thirty six thousand people\nAnd they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take ... to Monday\nSo that's another reason plots\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the fish or ... you know of course that there's

don't hear in the valley the sun we have all these beautiful hiking trails around there's some can get pretty rocky and steep the other day I was watching some kids climb up on a tall rock and had a steep face and it got up to the top they weren't even worried about falling they had no\nThought of how they were going to get down there was just no apparent concern for potential bodily harm\nBecause I watch them it dawned on me how risking their Bali health because they were young they had no concern\nAnd it's very similar to risky money in retirement they both have consequences for example when we're young we have no problem going up those hills Iraq's slipping and sliding then coming back down as little thoughts of danger consequences\nAnd along the way getting some bumps and bruises it's just easier to heal up from it when you're young\nOnce you get older though we may still go hiking but it's probably with a bit more cautious and\nThe reason for this as simple as we get older the ability for our bodies to absorb physical punishment it's decreased and the time it takes to recover his increased\nIf you think about it the same is true for our money when we're young we can absorb the bumps and bruises you could absorb a huge losses in retirement money you know because of the time period available to recover was much longer\nHowever when you're in retirement or close to retirement\nThere's little to no time to recover from those losses\nThe no marketing strategies I work with allow you to see the beauty without the danger you can still get to participate in the

participate in his ideals and even though this soldier fought valley he died in battle\nThe moral of the story is that good intentions don't win battles and if you bring a knife to a gunfight you're

get to it\n\nAs to the doctors with me as many of you treat breast cancer daily you have shared that there are\nCommon mess and misconceptions\nBut again when studies have looked at was wearing deodorant increase the risk of breast cancer they compared women who get breast cancer versus those that\nHaven't there's been no difference\nAnd so again I think it's quite safe um to for my ... wherever arise and where the odor and said we don't have to be smelly\n[laughter] okay All right Dr tax ah I'm not sure whether we ought to categorize that's why I'm as a fear or or math but either way\nThe the\nConception right or wrong that cancer is spread by the surgical opening up a tumor\nI think it's probably certainly both missing there and it's actually my favorite myth\nRudy thanks for asking about it the myths about exposure ... air\nWhen we operate on a tumor is very interesting one because it comes from the days before we had great imaging now days we're so lucky to have wonderful body imaging in terms of mammograms and C. T. scans that when a patient comes in we know what's going wrong with them because of that imaging before we even go to the operating room\nBut many generations ago that wasn't the case someone would come in clearly ill present to the physician in a um catastrophic state can you would take them to the operating room for what's called an exploratory lap Rodney essentially opening them up to find out what the problem was\nUh the ... surgery it's called a peek and shriek you would open them up\nSeed the tumors rattling the body and clothes and back up and the patient would subsequently die usually within weeks\nThe observation then became or the the myth became well they died because of the surgery and we know that surgery is enemy of the suppressant\nBut the fact of the matter is these people were already dying because of the unknown cancer and that mess has persisted despite the fact that with great imaging grade examination and other tools\nA finding a surprise these days as a surgeon is quite unusual that I hear this almost every day in the office someone asks me well if you take the tumor out isn't going to spread\nAnd so I share that myth with them and where it came from but then I also asked the question is it not better to remove the tumor then leave it\nWhen we know that it has the capacity to spread so that is definitely a fear of patients have but ah definitely a math\nAlong the same lines a common question is if someone has more breast tissue\n\nWould they then have a higher risk of breast cancer\nSo when we come back I mean I asked her I'll get back to quiets answer to this regarding brass are those more dance and those are also ah in women that have larger bras a common myth is that\nThose two instances might create a greater risk for breast cancer\nSo we'll we'll get an answer to that from Dr quiet the show's soon as we return we're going to take a real short break we'll be back\nIn a two minute so once again this is our fifth and final installment of breast cancer awareness\nWell it's that time of year but members speak for themselves don't they [noise] if you're the owner of the person in charge of your business you're looking at those numbers and thinking one or two things you're either plays for the bottom line of course you wish you would have done better\nOr you're disappointed the results just aren't what you were aiming for no matter the outcome before you get too far into the mix cycle\nI'd like car for a couple of things for you to consider\nIf you fell short in getting the coverage your opening for words are products that maybe you were advertising on the wrong straight so to speak\nAnd if you were on the wrong straight ten for sure you Mr ideal target demographics\nI realize that whether you're starting a business planning on expanding for just wanting dad margins to your bottom line the clock is ticking and has time to make some decisions [noise] this time but those dollars to work somewhere where you can get some bang for your buck\nI may ask you this what are you listening to right now\n[laughter] but guess what your potential clients are also listening to main street out loud right now I'm a woman so as you suggest this was a no brainer but I Will tell you that was our customer base demographics in the long jeopardy where you have with our major sponsors\nThe bottom line is simple we deliver you want to grow you I'm bigger numbers you want a stronger bottom line\nAs I said we deliver us get together email us uh advertise that main street\nOut loud dot com it's like this happen\nAgain that email address is advertise that main street out loud dot com look forward to hearing from you [noise]\nAll right folks were back again uh our fifth and final last segment regarding a breast cancer awareness and the question before we went to break regarding a dance a breast tissue\nAnd a larger breast or being a greater risk or not there for a cancer doctor quiet\nSeventy that's again and these are great questions and certainly things that women are thinking about um breast size itself is not a increased risk factor for breast cancer but\nWhat we do see is that within size of a breast size usually is an association with an increase body weight\nI'm In kind of goes back to the issues that are doing was talking about with sugar and the impact of the obesity on the risk of breast cancer and that's really I think where the challenges are today\nUm and again is that he was mentioning about the risk of sugar and I think it's really um needs to be very aware of the impact of our weight and what we're eating on our risk for health and wellness\nAnd trying to keep weight within the normal range\nUm easy to talk about B. M. i.'s body mass index which is a height weight ratio and recommend that women have a ratio under twenty five I'm to minimize those risks but in general um breast size ended up itself is not an independent risk for breast cancer\nFive men speaking of breast size or let's say a mosquito with Dr Frank O'Hara a women today are more and more common are breast implants\nAnd there is still of course the constant Tom over the concerns regarding their safety I think back to be highly publicized the Dow Corning a issue or back in the nineties I Believe regarding a implants\nSo is there still a justified cause for concern regarding implants Dr Franco\nSo thank you for having me really realistically you know the answer is implants are generally safe\nThe there we have very good studies long term studies on implant ... in a very large nurse population here in the United states called the national nurses study actually look at women\nNurses so is a semi confined population that they could follow for a long period of time\nAnd they actually compared women who had implants and who didn't have implants matched them for age mass for medical problems and watched him for ten years to see if there was any difference in the kind of medical problems that they would get\nThey didn't see any statistically significant difference in differences in all of the things that implants were said to have caused fibromyalgia rheumatoid arthritis\nAnd even breast cancer and realistically the only difference they did he was at women who had implants had a slightly decrease risk breast cancer probably because they just had smaller amounts breast tissue to begin with and\nNow the more interesting thing that's more recent more recent is that\nCertain types of implants which have a textured shout can cause and a plastic large cell lymphoma which is not impressed with breast cancer but it is a breast implant related cancer that they can cause\nHis very very rare we've only seen about five hundred cases worldwide in three parts million implants that are put in per year but it is something that we do to help patients about that when they make an educated decision they know that ahead of time\nHis rather [noise] relatively easy to treat it has something to be aware of\nAll right let's move from certain mess and go to more direct issues for instance that are quite a person that has absolutely no\nFamily history what so ever\nOr they correct to assume that there'll mocked get breast cancer and therefore the notion of screenings isn't really all that necessary maybe until much later in life and maybe it's a waste of time and money what do you say", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "20"}
