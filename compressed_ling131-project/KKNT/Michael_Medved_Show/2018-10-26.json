that there are obviously traveling through other you know Mexico depending on where they're coming from but it's like\nWhat your what your medical you know what can we do eat it\nOK well first of all Mexico has not been terrible on this and even President Trump has agreed that the new the new president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\nHas um I agree to some levels of cooperation they want to discourage these people from going through Mexico and the numbers of apparently declined recently but I have been cut in half\nWhich means that maybe half of these people have uh gone in another direction or split off from the caravan or are finding some places to stay in Mexico it seems to me this is an area where government can cooperate with and work closely with private charities\nAnd they're all kinds of private charities that could take it among themselves to greet these people on the Mexican side of the border before they get into the United states and say hey\nWe're going to help you get back home and when you get back home we're going to help put your feet on the ground and we're going to help work with you I I Know that the charities that we support\nActually do things

have access to their finances which is of you may be the law has but at the end of the day\nThey have to come to the conclusion that there's a rational side of the argument that they often fail to see or understand and I think you know even if you look into it a little further you would simply\nRelate to the point that there's this emotional side of them or for whatever reason they got to solve all the world's problems\nOr you know what it is I think it's a lot of it as guilt his in other words people look at themselves and I think look here I Am in America and I live in a great country and

violations and battery a close analysis of ... record will likely show he should have been in jail\nThis is a recurring but almost always ignore the phenomenon in one high profile case after another we learned that the criminal is a chronic offender with a wrap sheet that inappropriately functioning society would have mandated his incarceration at the time of his latest offense\nYet Democrats and too many Republicans including some in the White House are dead set on increasing the number of convicted felons inclusive including dealers have drugs like ...\nOn the streets they weren't shorter sentences for such offenders and they want them released from jail early an obvious breakfast recipe for more crime faster\nAnd short the bipartisan leniency for felons crowds seeks to make our under

or racist she spoke wrongly clearly about something she didn't know much about\nIt didn't move any of her other co panelists at the time but after her show earlier this week she was instructed on how wrong she was and that she was defending a racist practice\nSo what did she do she corrected it and apologized profusely and then she did something more\nShe gave a show to the instruction on her error\nShe brought in to black journalists Roland Martin and Amy homes to teach her and the country all about the history of blackface and why it is wrong and why it matters literally Megan who I'm not much of a fan of took her unintentional mistake and turned it into a teaching\nTeachable moment\nAnd it was a damned good teaching I like Roland Martin almost not at all but he did a great job on the history that Megan was unfamiliar with and so many of us to\nSeems to me when you era in this country you apologize and that should be the end of it\nMegan went further and hosted a show to educate us all one might say that her repair her fix what's a net positive compared to the fence in other words one might almost be grateful for her offense because of the lessons she allowed it to
