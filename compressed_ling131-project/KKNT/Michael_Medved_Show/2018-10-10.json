offering housing to those who can fly here if needs to be we're sending charitable contributions which will probably be established for the taking within the next day or so\nWe can't write op eds about it we can't motivate people to vote one way or the other about it we can't call or write our congressmen about it we can't develop policy about it we can to educate ourselves more on how to prevent it in the future we can't debate about it we can't try to figure it out\nAt all\nSo if I'm wrong tell me but I I just don't get hounded Walker Percy once put it I hate to find tedious what give such general satisfaction\nBut I find it tedious so at that said ah\nWe're going to basically be a force miss your free zone here unless you think I'm wrong and you can tell me six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero\nNFO charitable causes to come from this of course will help we are human beings after all but that said and until then we are human beings after all and can no more than king canoe stop ... couldn't stop the water's we cannot stop these waters\nAnd it's just an ongoing curiosity to me how so much coverage can be dedicated to so much of this\nSo if I'm I may continue have you seen the latest from the Democrats are from the left you know the party whose most recent presidential candidate told us there was a crisis in our civil institutions and that our democracy was at great risk from Donald Trump\nWell\nToday we're told from Eric Holder the former attorney general at a ... a political rally exactly this quote Michele always says he's talking about Michelle Obama Michele always says I Love her she and my wife are like really tight which always scares me and Brock but Michelle always says when they go low we\nGo high you know when they go low we kick them close quote we kick them nice not on civil not a discouragement to violence employees per call how many sentiments have been expressed about Donald Trump's incitement\nOf which I by the way find no evidence\nThis of course the day after the previous mentioned democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said as you recall we discussed yesterday quote you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nThat is why I Believe if we're fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's one civility can start again\nYou get the full threat here right for Democrats the time for civility is over and it's over because there was an opposing party that disagrees with them\nIt not only has disagreed with them it does sound purchase with the American people who have put the opposing party in power that's kind of how democracies work that's kind of how Republican forms of government work\nNot everyone will agree with you this is a for better or worse mostly two party system if not two three if not three four it is not a one party system it is not a ... a ... a dictatorship it is not an autocracy\nIf you want to know the kind of government you would get if she were to get power from her comments you have to assume that that's what she would want\n\nA dictatorship of forms or an autocracy she says destroy ratcheting up the rhetoric\nShe says destroy you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and I have no idea why she says this this way except to further inflame our language I don't even know how you destroy a piece of legislation\nYou can amend it can alter it you can disagree with it you can reverse or change it and it's done all the time\nLook for instance that all the things the Clinton's did to the Reagan Bush policies take tax reform for one thing if you want did any Republicans say Clinton was destroying Reagan's tax policies\nDid anyone saber Rocco bomber was destroying\nAnything when he threatened to use his pen and engaging\nIn changing the federal code of regulations when he couldn't get what he wanted by legislation no he may have been amassing unilateral powers to the executive that were unconstitutional and perhaps one could say that was a form of destruction of the constitution\nBut no one ever said\nHe was destroying legislation or destroying what the other party stood for\nIts destroying what the American republic stands for to talk this way and she gives the tail away when she says quote that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nSo there shall be no civility until the Democrats are back in power\nThat's what she's saying that's what she wants\nNo civility until the Democrats are back in power and then everyone gets to play by mark is of queens very rules once again because the party that supposed to govern the party that's entitled to govern has been restored\nTo it's eminent and proper place in our Republican form of democracy how can she possibly belief that how she can she possibly not understand that not everyone agrees with her how can she possibly not understand that not everyone is a Democrat\nAnd what can you possibly mean when she says you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what we now know\nWe now know because she's been been given an assist by Eric Holder the attorney general who says we kick 'em\nWe kick them as they're not been a surf it up enough left wing violence in this country\nFrom the black panther party to the weather underground to the ... Liberation Army to fail and terrorism to Ted Kaczynski to environmental an animal rights terrorism has there not been enough threats\nOf violence and Gore by politics from the likes of Madonna and De Niro and Johnny Depp and Kathy Griffin has there not been enough violence when we're shooting up Republican softball Republicans at a softball game [noise]\nAmerica great again she made it about making America great again he made it about America she made it about her she made it about her I'm with her he's making it about America yeah talk about their arrogance\nAnd supposedly Donald trumps the egomaniac\nWell you know they always pay the other side whoever is in Arizona border their rules out those walls a salt that's his book is always back the other side\nAs exactly what you're doing and condemn it\nThis is also the Chris Buskirk rural or in in an application as well if you want to know what the Democrats are up to just look at what they accuse Republicans of doing\nRight we live in danger as\nWell we do but they're the ones making a dangerous they're the ones invoking ... or ... I'm In protecting us to fight they're the one well\n... you know calling for\nKicking us they're the ones saying we can't be civil they're the ones saying getting their face they're the ones saying follow them at restaurants follow them on airplanes follow them wherever they go get in their face started with Brock momma\nI think we need to have a blow out at the ballot box\nI think we do I think we do I think we do this was the point who is making this point on our show the other day uh who are Brian Williams Robin Williams from the ... was making the point that the only way to overcome this polarization is for one side\nTo absolutely dominate and show the other side that it's got a lottery working to do we had a similar guest who said you know when you think back\nTo the um [noise] to the end of the uh the end of the Obama era close to the end of the Obama era the Republican Party seemed kind of exhausted it kinda seemed like a spent force and then come you know Donald Trump\nAided and abated by you know a handful of really strong and powerful\nA [noise] a political leaders I I'd like to think of Tom Cotton is one of them I'm going to think of a you know a handful of others who have gotten their spine over the past two years and maybe even regained is fine they forgot they had\nSpecially after the Brett Kavanaugh fight oh my [noise] but I you know I Will tell ya it's it's evidently driving the Democrats and not just that they aren't convincing that they aren't they aren't convincing more Americans to sign up for their for their ...\nYou can't you can't you can't find something with a noisy and they keep giving us the ... and and throw tantrums like Yosemite Sam because they can't they can't get the rest of the country to go along with their agenda so there was sort of I call us costs to violence\nIt's hard to argue with success\nI'm I'm for that I'm with that so we just need to have a lot more we need to have a lot more and November need to be big\nIt will be hurts our kids today\nPeter I appreciate your call thank you very much they walk you betcha a okay there's a bunch I wanted a DJ Oh yes there isn't there is a um there there there isn't a dengue them that goes along with these calls to violence\nAnd it is a to attack the constitution or\nRemember from the people that have told us\nThat Donald Trump is attacking The Cosby show the people who
