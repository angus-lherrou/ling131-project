{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "Okay not villa find somebody but has she answered the question about what should be done when the caravan comes to the borders of the United states\nAnd and this is where the Democrats fail completely because they have nothing to say about it\nIn other words at least President Trump has a virtue of cap clarity here he\nDoes not want some kind of mass entry into the United states and by the way we get along I think relax a little bit there's an interesting piece in the Los Angeles times\nAbout the asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration and it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration\nRight now is at a forty year low the only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWe're the last three years including last year as the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy part of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush\nIn any event here's the interesting thing\nWhen uh people come here\nIn terms of uh applying for asylum between the years two thousand\nOh in two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration immigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the\nPeople who came here from Guatemala\nSeeking asylum so she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum or turn back\nAnd that it seems to me is reasonable and says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stop granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence\nA move that could block tens of thousands of people I'm gaining permanent entry into the U.S and in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband\nYou probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable enough uh let\nUs go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're on the Michael ...\nI'm Mike I'm yeah I I just find that you know disheartening and an unbelievable how the fight and paid for the left side media is lying they don't give you that the whole story they cut things out anything they can do\nA good choice for the trading a flawed as far as I'm concerned but I'm\n... and the the that the political leave on the left side\nThere that are lower than bottom feeder tactic of marrying President Trump and and he has made a lot of accounts he he's he's pretty much kept this war he stayed on target he's trying but like you said nobody is perfect guy created nobody's perfect\nRight but the point is it don't you I I don't Jay would be helpful if folks on our side didn't for instance chant lock her up lock her up um\nI mean again it's I I think the American people are kind of tired of that and that's OK maybe in the height of a campaign but I don't think it helps our side and it's not a question that there's some kind of great huge moral outrage or this crosses some line that's inscribed in the heavens\nIt's dumb politics because actually particularly the key deciding voters in a in this coming election are going to be white suburban women\nAnd I'm not sure the chance of a lock her up for anybody are going to help gym in Portland, Oregon you're on the Michael ...\nMichael I was wondering um if ... how can our political community a de polarized and get back at some of 'em respect for a loyal opposition I I Hope it's not forever lost it doesn't look good do right now\nI agree with you and a look I I think if I'm\nA one of the things that that will be important is particularly if you look at some of the ads that the Democrats are running I mean some of them I've seen in down in Oregon we have a good chance of electing a Republican governor and um and and here in\nIn my state the ads are so hateful the most important thing is not to reward hateful illness\nDon't reward it or you'll get more of it and when people say well you have to vote democratic to put some kind of check on President Trump selection isn't about President Trump's it's about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer Trump status is not going to change is going to continue as

painter\nJim Carrey\nOf who once with a very talented comedian and actor and [noise]\nI'm not so much anymore what have we heard from recently or seen recently\nFrom Jim Carrey other than his very strong politically themed paintings [noise] he came out with a painting that he just did and it is the ugliest most hateful thing imaginable [noise]\nIt shows a a crude caricature of President Trump\nWith an open mouth and in the middle of his mouth is a pipe bomb\nThe photographs of the pipe bomb that they you know and I don't even\nWant to posted its its ugly and it's disgusting and are they are reporting the Jim Carrey is pending at least part of the blame for multiple explosive devices targeting Democrats and CNN on President Trump's he's not being part of the blame blame a\nPlenty of blame it shows Obama emerging from Trump's mouth Trump spoken the bomb came into existence\nGod's spoken light in the world came into existence so why not Trump ... create a pipe bomb in his mouth in any event uh he um the pipe bombs\nOf course this this morning we're targeting and by the way there is not is not true it is fake news that there was a pipe bomb targeting CNN\nThere was a pipe bomb targeting John Brennan now yesterday misspelled his name they spelled it B. R. E. N. A. N. or just one and two and but they addressed it to them care of CNN he also does by the way commentary on MSNBC he um he he actually\nPlays both sides of the ... on that one both so balanced\nCNN and MSNBC [noise] in other words but MSNBC did not get a John Brennan package CNN did but all of these packages seemed to be very directly and personally addressed two\nProminent figures on the American left bronco bomb\nHillary Clinton former attorney general Eric Holder congresswoman Maxine Waters and yes ah also Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz now\nYou may have heard on this show and I know it can be a little bit confusing that the return address on these packages on all of them apparently was Debbie Wasserman Schultz no one believes that she's the one who send these bombs [laughter] usually send a bomb you don't put your real address on it I mean\nAnd I know Debbie Wasserman Schultz has an idiot she is but uh no she didn't do this ... I don't I don't think anyone is suspecting that congresswoman Wasserman Schultz did this\nWhat obviously was going on here is that this was the warped sense of humor of evil and warped individual whoever it is who did this\nWho figured oh great if they don't deliver this package and they return and then I'll get bent Debbie Wasserman Schultz and in trouble if even if I don't blow it up with a bomb that I sent her way\nUm look all of this is is serious enough and I'm OK Debbie Wasserman Schultz today condemned the\nPackages sent this week with her return address shift saying she is deeply disturbed that her name was attached to I I can imagine that I can sympathize with that\nPackages apparently can turning can painting explosives were sent on Wednesday to high level democratic leaders including former President Obama former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with Wasserman Schultz has also has a name as the return address\nOne of those\nPackages addressed former attorney general Eric Holder was returned\nTo Wasserman Schultz his office because it was sent to the wrong address two\nOf her Florida officers were evacuated and response she confirmed in a statement\nThe one time Democratic National committee chair she's been replaced by the indescribable fulltime Paris or she says in her statement we will not be intimidated by this attempted act of violence the appalling attack on our democracy\nMust be vigorously prosecuted and I am deeply disturbed by the way my name was used okay I think it it makes it fairly clear that um there are a lot of suspects on this and I hope that by the time we're on the air tomorrow\nThey will have identified a suspect they certainly should they should move as quickly and decisively as I possibly can but a meanwhile\nThere's all sorts of craziness Stacey Abrams is running for governor of Georgia\nAnd there are a series of issues that of a rough did one of them not that serious one of them it seems to me very serious\nAnd one of them it just seems to me is very very serious one that wasn't that serious\nIs that on the former flag of the state of Georgia she engage while she was in college in a protest or in which the state flag not the American flag with state flag was burned by cause it had the old Confederate battle flag in the flag\nThey changed the said flag she has never been involved with burning of their flag since then okay let that want to go for a moment much more serious\nShe has called for doing a Taliban on Stone Mountain which is a huge and and beautiful mountain than city park where it would cost literally hundreds of millions of dollars and it would be unsightly and destructive\nTo a racing work of art that was put up there in Nineteen thirty one is when they finished it they've started putting it up and Nineteen fourteen and say three acres three acres of carved stone\nAnd she wants to blow it up I think it's perfectly appropriate if they put signage they're all around us saying that this image of Jefferson Davis and Robert de Leon Stonewall Jackson commemorates would cause\nThat we do not on our support and I think it's been very clear that the government in Georgia the government of the whole United States\nHas rejected the whole idea of the confederacy and the white supremacy that the confederacy was based upon very proudly very directly that's fine but this idea that they're they're even black leaders\nWho have spoken out against Stacey Abrams radical position about basically blowing up and Dinah mining Stone Mountain it's a Taliban position and it\nStinks and even worse was what you said last night now look I understand\nThe Democrats are trying to capitalize on this health care issue but you think the way to capitalize on the health care issue is to trash the entire free market system here is what Stacey Abrams the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia had to say last\n[laughter] and here you are really more [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n\nSo [laughter] I remind your heart [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay the whole idea there is no profit and doing the right thing is entirely wrong\nBecause the very essence of the free market system the very essence of capitalism\nIs that you give people what they want and how do you know what they want is what they pay for and the notion that no one can make a profit doing the right thing that has only government that can provide for people\nIs utterly ludicrous and what\nShe is saying here I Hope loses or the election I really really do because ... is that the free market system that we have to the extent that we even have a free market system anymore and we do to a large extent you still have a lot of choice in your medical care\nAnd the idea that that is inappropriate when she says I've never seen the free market um write a prescription in rural Georgia I'll bet there are people in rural Georgia who were ... listening to us right now\nWho have gone in and gotten prescriptions through the free market either because you have health insurance that covers that or because you paid for the prescription yourself and because it's made available at a local pharmacy now does that local pharmacy make profit by selling your prescription of course they do\nBut you see that's the whole idea of a free market you pay them rather than in slave in them\nAnd government forces a matter of enslavement this is the point that I'm Rand makes brilliantly is it basically to get people what you want to do you can either use money\nAnd pay them to do what you want them to do or you can use force\nAnd and they should uh very aggressively and look\nDo you do you really believe that there is some democratic operatives\nWho would actually risk the idea of killing some of his own heroes people like President Obama and people like Hillary Clinton or heroes to Democrats I guess they were out there who's so deep pray that he would risk killing them and killing innocent people in between in order to gain some political advantage I\nJust like this who who thousand one one of the terrorism was you know lost on us in the building was my breasts that you know our government\nOur financial structures and there were ... from them so I think\nJust part of the ... and you you you\nYou also think that uh two thousand and one was it was not committed by foreign terrorists um\nOh yeah a a ... I think it was her\nOkay good so so what does our government has to do with that in other words my problem with us with with what you're saying we as I think is\nBigger than what everybody's looking at it as much burgers and Ben ... bombed us much burger and more confined to there's more critical involved and and what you think\nWell I again if that's the case then I think they definitely ah we'll figure it out I uh I I appreciate your call but I I Hope that people will not\nBegin seeing your neighbors and your associates who may be completely wrong politically and disagree with you as definition only bad people because they disagree with you\nOn this I think president remember President Trump on all kinds of trouble for saying they repeat good people on both sides in Charlottesville well they weren't good people on the Nazi side who's wrong about that but on the side between Democrats and Republicans yes there are good people on both sides can\nWe knowledge that\nLet's go to Greg in Seattle Greg you're on the Michael med show\nHow's it going go out and talk about that you're ...\nOr ... talking about all the free market healthcare right and\nShe thought that just took a grip on their side I mean really you know when you talk about the freeway traveling around really what it is it's the it's the lack of free market be opaque pricing you can't just you know go probably something out when one count or another for a better price [noise] um that's\nYou know and it was because there first of all there's so many lawsuits and there's so many regulations in so much government interference\nAnd more than half of every dollar that we spend on health care right now and passes through the government\nAnd the government takes it from people and then the government spends it so you're right we are very far from a free market system in any pure sense in a health care a lead to go go to Heather in lieu of all Heather you're on the Michael Mann that show\nAnd I heard it yeah thank you\nUm I'd say the last caller that came on mentioned that he got an inside job and you asked why would he play you know people who live in a line or do we know yet that these bombs actually\nContained\nThat made a bold material or were they just\nTo add is what what all the media sources are reporting that they were a rudimentary but they were ... they were operational explosive devices they could have exploded it wasn't ...\nAnd uh again they probably would have done some attention was helping powder to show somebody just wanted to impact the politics enough to damage people's they probably would have said something very different we'll be right back on the ... [noise]\n\n\n[noise] nice to see no\nHow real combat President Trump that federal investigators will find out the second explosive devices to several high profile Democrats than CNN Trump called\nThe actions despicable and set a major federal investigation is underway in remarks at the White House today Trump said there is no place for any kind of political violence in the last he also said Americans must come together and unify suspected explosive devices were mailed to CNN headquarters in New York\nFormer President Obama and Hillary Clinton a former attorney general Eric Holder\nFlorida democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and California Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters\nMeanwhile former President Bill Clinton is thanking the secret service for intercepting one of those suspected explosive devices former presidents and first lady never see male that has not been inspected by the secret service\nOn Tuesdays CNN Tonight former attorney general Eric Holder said than a minority in this country presumably meaning Republicans have taken power that it's not there to take\n... report told her was discussing gerrymandering and voter suppression when he said it quote you are seeing a minority in this country taking power that is not legitimately there's\nHold her went on to say that Democrats can overcome gerrymandering if they have a big turnout in the mid term elections he went on to accuse a minority of people are taking positions that quote most of the rest of the country does not favor and hold quote views inconsistent with the wishes of the majority\nIn the news armed security guards will be patrolling some Tempe parks attempt the city council this week approved expanding the use of a private security company to provide guards to keep watch on select parks as part of a pilot program\nThat runs through next June and it's ... percent people express concerns about increased criminal activity and sometimes the parks the program we'll be expanded to about ten parks on a rotating basis now the the NBC market report brought to you by Grand Canyon planning\n\nI'm Tom ... be the NBC another massive fell off today on Wall street sending the down more than six hundred points lower wiping out all the games and made this year\nThe magic of its worst day in more than seven years plunging three hundred and twenty nine points big driver\nDo supporting earnings and outlooks UPS Volkswagen Texas Instruments all Saudi President Trump's tariffs wars for future profit declines there just wasn't all bad do bowling at a blowout quarter on higher commercial and military jet sales Jersey did hire\nAfter the bell strong earnings at Ford Microsoft and a surprise beat at Tesla its first quarterly profit ever\nSales of newly built homes in September down for the fourth month in a row prices are too high mortgage rates are up and this year's Consumer Reports reliability rankings Alexis of its parent company Toyota tops again for the sixth year running\nThe highest ranked us brand was poured at Eighteen compost be CNBC\nHey this is Michael event for American federal rare coin and bowling and if you bought or sold gold coins in Bolivia and then you know that many dealers claimed to be competitive when they're showing you the coins and they claimed that pay top dollar when they're buying them but how do you know if their claims are even true American federal\nHas been in business for thirty seven years and I can tell you from personal experience they really do pay more for your coins don't be fooled by other dealers who claimed to pay the highest prices it's usually just a ploy to get you into\nTheir office so they can trade you up to coins that are heavily marked up it may seem like these other dealers are offering to pay more but in reality they're overcharging you willing to trade American federal will always give you a from cash prize when buying your coins van if you want to purchase gold silver other cause\nYou'll buy them at American federal wholesale price no inflated claims just true top dollar before you accept an offer anywhere else Paul American federal rare coin bullion foray into five five three fifty two eighty two that for a photo five five three fifty two eighty two American federal dot com that's American federal dot com\n[noise]\nOn the Michael ... show on there is a a very good point there was just made about a tire on that is running on CNN and this is one of those things where with this news especially with\nCNN as part of it the ah the Tyrone on CNN says bombs sent to CNN Clinton's Obama's others in an act of terror\nUm\nThat that doesn't fit because of the bomb wasn't sent to CNN and it was sent to John\nBrennan the address was CNN the\nBomb was addressed to John Brennan and then CNN the building so really to be consistent it would say the bombs into CNN a home in ... New York\nAnd uh at at home and cook Jonah and Obama officers\nBut you see the point is why do they bliss CNN first as if she and it was a main target of the attack because that goes along\nWith their general narrative that this whole thing\nIs part and parcel of and associated with Trump's war with mainstream media\nI look I said for a long time I think the war with mainstream media is ill considered I don't think it serves the president I certainly certainly don't think it serves the Republican Party in going into the selection or do I think it's fair inappropriate to call out media when they distort things like this guy run does\nOkay uh uh a couple\nOf other issues one is in this very red hot and very close Florida election for governor\nThere is the kind of scandal that has emerged about the Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee\nWhich if he were conservative he would be totally sunk this is a media double standard\nA of an unbelievable level\nBecause there's an ongoing ethics investigation there was an FBI agent who was involved in trying to expose corruption in the city of Tallahassee where he was mare and it turns out\nThat there was an undercover agent who was posing as a land developer who is doing all kinds of illicit things like taking mayor Gillum on vacations to Costa Rica and New York which\nHe arranged the FBI undercover agent posing as a land developer is going to be working there\nAnd getting him tickets to Hamilton now you might say a big deal to take us away the adults and things like a thousand dollars each and he had benign when he was speaking to the FBI later a mayor Gillum and this is now this is not even contested he had lied to the FBI and he said no I paid for my own tickets\nAnd are they now have email messages that have been made public which show that no the tickets were a gift\nThe or in fact Corey or the FBI agent and texted Gillum on August tends to thousands sixteen Mike Miller on the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at eight PM and then mayor Gillum replied awesome news about Hamilton's\nSo if corruption itself is an important don't you think lying should be and try to imagine for a moment that he wants a liberal darling\nThan he wasn't a democratic nominee for governor of the state there's this kind of scandal would have sunk him and there's something else that that people\nAre just wrong about I mean one of the big democratic issues that they're trying to raise across the country in the last Thirteen Days the election is it President Trump as a hate filled big ed and he wants to make war on transgender people and wipe them out and said I'm going to concentration camps et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAnd or can we agree here that gender identity should be an inter individual matter and that it should not be decided by the federal government\nAnd basically that is what the Trump Administration wants is not to impose federal standards about how you respond to somebody else who says I'm a woman even though he may be biologically equipped as a man\nAnd by the way in the New York times they have a\nA a big piece very sympathetic is transgender as Mrs anatomy does not determine gender experts say but there's this section and that I think is fascinating\nThey write no one knows for sure why body and mind sometimes do not match\nBut being transgender is not a matter of choice Dr safer they quote this expert says ah it is not a fat or a whim for transgender people at a generally an overwhelming sense that their gender is not the one on their birth certificate and gender is not about who they're attracted to it's about who they are\nBut see if they get the right to be who you are that doesn't mean that you have the right to demand that the government's force everybody else to accept that\nCan we leave this deprive a choice and get the federal government out of this and at the very worst have some kind of state policy concerning bathrooms but for\nGod's sake it's insane to think that anyone gains by having the federal government in Washington [noise] uh decide who goes into which bathroom now one of the ways you decide who goes to which movies is on by getting the word on them from me\nOr I recently saw the recent mama mia move with Meryl Streep again while she's in briefly and many more is it worth seeing a check it

into my smart retirement with certified financial planner Nancy Fleming Saturday that twelve PM first found the answers and practical ideas for your retirement concerns that my smart retirement with Nancy Fleming Saturday that twelve PM right here on nine sixty the patriots\nYou ... yeah the bike right in the grass where the kids left me a while ago you know how lonely it is being left day after day not being able to cruise reservation pardon me remember when you got me for the kids you told them no your kids go how fun enjoy the outdoors and be careful and\nYou're I mean it when they put

freedom used to be the Alliance Defense fund but it's the ATF or they\nDo a great job protecting religious liberty which is under constant attack you know talking here in the studio\nAbout literally hundreds of millions billions of dollars that is spent on the other side by the American civil liberties union\nWe do our sponsors of you appreciate your support\nRadio station ... nine sixty patriot\n\nAs opposed to politics [noise] there is a staff leaves and show [noise]\n\nWednesday October twenty four two thousand seats in you've often heard me say\nThat every anthropologist loves his own tribe and that would explain why the media has spent so much time in the gym all could show the murder just as talk radio would spend a lot of time disproportionate to others if God Forbid a radio host were murdered\nI think in the show he case it's a bit of a bootstrap and stretch has he wasn't really a journalist but we'll leave that for another day\nThe point is this have CNN were not delivered male or otherwise and it seems that may not have been male but no matter if CNN were not delivered the weapon they received today\nAnd if there was not an overwhelming ratcheting up of left wing my ... of late the story of the day would not be so profuse and ubiquitous\nBut for those who and I've never been one of them for those who blames speech for action we can talk about that for those who are doing that now like Jeff Zucker of CNN blaming Trump's rhetoric for the actions\nThat took place today let us keep in mind or is Walter so check would put it do let us not forget\nA Republican congressional delegation was shot out on a baseball field\nGOP political activists have been routinely physically harassed Eric Holder said we don't go high we should kick them meaning Republicans rock Obama has said get up in their face meaning Republicans\nHillary Clinton has said there cannot be any civility that those who oppose her politics meaning Republicans Maxine Waters is called for openly harassing Trump supporters and of course the lovely organization known as antifa which is every civil societies nightmare\nLet us not forget about any of this\nAnd so we have seen both in locations and descriptions of the left in action whether it's been antifa violence the tackling of Rand Paul screaming and Jeff Flake in an elevator shooting Republicans in a baseball field\nHurling objects that conservatives like Heather McDonald or Charles Murray around Coulter on college campuses are threatening so much violence that other conservatives are just invited from campuses\nBecause the headquarters veto wins the day or the recent violence in Oregon or the depicting of Donald Trump with a blood drenched severed head or the threat of bombing the White House you have a lot of violence\nAnd being Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a restaurant or Ted Cruz in a restaurant you get more\nSo yeah I think the news today would be a little more tempered if none of the above were true and seeking desperately seeking a counter narrative and if CNN were not delivered a weapon but here we are\nAnd us the queen of instability like Alice in wonderland queen of hearts Hillary Clinton said today at a campaign event for Democrats in Florida quote but it is a troubling time isn't it and it's a time of deep divisions and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together\nWe also have to elect candidates will try to do the same clothes quote let's break that down shall we why is it a troubling time I'm not particularly troubled were you\nI've actually enjoyed our country's conditions of late\nIt's troubling because she's not the president literally that can be the only definition for her ... it's a troubling times since when have the facts on the ground up this place we call America ever been better\nShe says it's a time of deep division why a lot of us did not go round marching and shouting not my president a lot of us voted for the president and we're very much looking forward to a peaceful transition of power just as when her husband won the election from a Republican administration and candidate that preceded his tenure\nIs a deeply divided because Donald Trump did not win a majority of the popular vote well neither did her husband in Nineteen Ninety two\nFits time of deep division I can guarantee you because it's by definition the division is not coming from the party and people empower its from those who lost power and didn't get the power they hoped for and they felt entitled to\nAfter all it is not she is it not she who a week ago said you cannot be civil to those who oppose you politically until they get back in power\nIt was she she called for instability\nI Know that's not bombs necessarily but what does someone mean when they tell people not to be civil\nSo spare me her lecturing us it's a time of deep division as she uses her ... passive voice she helped lead it\nThen of course the political shot you know the exact thing everyone has always told not to do in a time like this I you politicize the situation well that's what she did this morning when she said we have to act we have to elect candidates will try to do the same same what bring our country together\nAgain who tortoise under who torn apart ... and leadership they can't do that\nHere was Donald Trump in his inaugural address quote we the citizens of America are now joined integrate national effort to rebuild our country\nAnd to restore its promise for all of our people to gather we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done\nEvery four years we gather on the steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their grace just aid threw out this transition they have been magnificent close quote he went on\nQuoted it's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers soldiers will never forget that whether we are black or brown or white\nWe all bleed the same red blooded patriots we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska they look up at the same night sky they feel their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life but at the same almighty creator close quote\nDivisive don't\nTell me about divisiveness took less than six hours after our president spoke those words for not my president movement to take off including wishes localized by popular the most popular musicians saying the White House should be bombed\nDon't you dare use your passive voice in lecturing us about ... times Mrs Clinton\nNow while I'm here I Will say this not because I Want to think I have\nTo and I regret anyone thinks they should have to say this bombs are obviously not the answer to any political discontent here and whoever did this must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and beyond if possible with the shame and humiliation that should attend such\nBut it is not incumbent on us to say that it is our defaulted is our natural law\nWhat is the incumbent is for all parties to go back to Lincoln's life seeing them address as we did here last week and re read what environment it's been created by word indeed by action by the resistance movement in America\nAnd remember what the funds that are ratio of the resistance movement is\nA\nA peaceful election outcome they simply did not like wedded to be a tactic resistance named after the French uprising against the Nazis\nBy using the word resistance for their political dissent and behavior they have automatically conjured up deliberately exactly what we denounced here yesterday the analog that Donald\nTrump is Adolf Hitler the reduction CEO at Hitler um\nCalled the president Hitler you're automatically invoking the first rational defense of violent overthrow violent overthrow do you know that do realize that your invoking the classic case for violent resistance and revolution\nBut here you are today lecturing us we conservatives to be blamed for a climate of violence all we ever did was vote\nSometimes I have to confess I listened to Hillary and Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and Madonna and Robert De Niro Kathy\nGriffin and the rest and I think\nYou guys are standing around a fire\nFire you built fire you of poured gasoline on fire you lit a fire you give oxygen true too and you sit there and watch it and whenever you can get a camera or tweet\nYell theater\nAll the way to live in um there's a lot of\nDiversity actually in\n... I mean this is this is not a herd of independent mines\nThere is a lot of it they don't agree with each other\nOn a lot of things I just think it's an interesting thing to point out you want diversity of this is where you come\nAnd you're absolutely right because there is there's times I don't agree with President Trump you know I think for him upside totally behind him love what you're doing for the country but they're trying to I don't agree with you name but you know that that's being an adult and that's the yeah be having the intelligence\nTo be able to disagree and just got the\nProblem now I think is too many people don't have the intelligence or don't have the knowledge to actually get caught\nI you know what I said and I I have a granddaughter in college now\nVery right girl liberal of course she said I said honey you're Eighteen\nWhen you're Eighteen you're a liberal if you're not a liberal you don't have a hard this is it called [laughter] but you know if you're forty and you're a liberal you don't have a great you know you won't find that out because she hardworking sure doesn't expect anything handed to where to go out and work for what she\nDoesn't think the government always or anything\nSo she'll find out in time you know in China system is going to\nShow well I also think with the natural love and respect she would have for her grandmother the lessons you've taught her well have a deep and impactful meaning whether they happen tomorrow or in a year or in five years you know the court in some banging background work that you've laid and her parents have done my I have no doubt I have no they have a\nJob with all of them and and so they've been brought up with that that knowledge that listen you want something you're going to have to help us work for it you know it's not just the hand and you wouldn't appreciate it if we did that\nSo I'm sure you're not you're wonderful I really do think you I mean I Know one other comment I Want to say because you said it to me upset a to a lot of people no doubt you've said it to a lot of people lose your where you're supposed to be and I I Believe you know the beginning of wisdom and a belief in in in in a higher being God\nComes when someone can so you're exactly where you're supposed to be there's a large plan for all of us can grab the terms of peace with exactly where you're supposed to be that's the beginning not only actually of\nWisdom but maybe contentment unhappiness\nPolitically it is that will go into law sister thank you so much thank you keep up the good work please thank you you to actually like to thank you Esther Susan don't go away we'll be right back I Am set sleeps in the number six zero to five zero eight zero in on six year old [noise]\n\nUm\n[noise]
