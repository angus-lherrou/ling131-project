around by Jeffrey Myers of ah the tree of life\nTemple that was\nConservative synagogue was attacked by\nAn evil evil gunman who of course now is in custody\nThe president's also accompanied by his daughter Yvonne God and his son in law Jared Kushner\nOf both of whom live their lives as religious\nJews and uh [noise] what is so sad and honestly it makes me kind of feel\nThat it virtually everything this president does including things that are fine that are normal\nThat aren't necessarily brilliant are deep for profound but they're just normal president things ever everything is going to be controversial and I I I just anticipate this controversy coming across I have to give you a little bit of a visual description of what happened here\nIn front of the synagogue and the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh they've set up a series of memorials\nTwo of the fallen to to the eleven people were killed were murdered in that synagogue and people abroad flowers and\nAnd by the way President Trump a and I think probably through the influence of his daughter or maybe through a staffer a son in law who knows he knew that the Jewish tradition is that in in Judaism when you go to a\nTo honor someone at at a at a grave side um you you leave a a Little Rock a pebble um sometimes it can be a larger stone but it is the idea that it's not something that phase is on the stays there\nAnd the idea that um there's a phrase in Yiddish that that means that the the dead don't smell the flowers\nSo basically that's a sign of morning and the president and the first lady and volunteer and Jarrett all brought they had a tray of of stones I Believe that secretary minutiae and\nWho was also a Jewish as secretary of treasury who is with them okay here's here's what I Am anticipating and honestly this is a case where I Hope I'm wrong [noise]\nUm [noise] the series of Jewish stars six point and stars stars in David ... referred to as the ... ... the the shield of David and\nOkay that those SARS have been set up an honor of the fallen here but they have been put in front of what is obviously crosses a that you would have on a temporary grave side\nSo what the president is seeing as these seeing a Jewish star but behind that Jewish stars across\nSome idiot and it's not going to bring up a an element of controversy because what it shows is the president of the United states and the first lady very respectfully\nAnd some really are leaving their rocks on the cross bars with across behind the star of David\nDo I find it offensive that they used process to set up this temporary memorial this is not at the graveyard this was asked to synagogue itself where the killings took place\nI think it's fine uh let let me also say I think it's it's a shame that er controversy has erupted\nOver a campaign stop in Michigan that I'm an advice vice president Pence was involved with and and here's the background of the story and I'll do it very quickly\nBecause we have some outrageous material to get to that that really does need attention but what happened with the vice president was he was campaigning for a a fine candidate named Lena Epstein\nWho is running in a a contested hotly contested congressional race to become a the first Jewish Republican woman in the house of representatives and that would be a good thing\nThey wanted because the vice president was making campaign of parents to have somebody say some kind of a memorial\nPrayer on behalf of the people fell\nIn Pittsburgh and that's also very appropriate\n... wasn't so appropriate is Lena Epstein for reasons that are completely unclear or may not seen as a member of a Jewish congregations she's fairly active she is proudly unapologetically Jewish but she apparently selected um\n[noise] to deliver this prayer\nA or a Christian um who actually went to a Baptist seminary and now styles himself rabbi and he was there wearing a prayer shawl and he said this prayer in the name of a of Jesus\nAnd no it's not a good thing it it just isn't because of the people who died were not Christians they were not Jewish Christians they were Jewish Jewish they were members of the conservative Jewish congregations\nAnd this is not a controversy that the vice president needs or the administration needs or anybody needs right now\nAnd uh does that mean that the Lena Epstein should not be elected to Congress of course she should be elected to Congress but it means that if if we're going to be serious about trying to build\nA broader base of support for this administration there could have been much more care with that one now meanwhile the protestors who were trying to disrupt the president's visit\nTo um\nTo Pittsburgh it's just awful and\nAnd uh uh demonstrators said Trump is fanned the flames of hating us partially responsible for this tragedy and his only making things worse by coming housing making things worse\nAnd what does he have to do with this tragedy the the person the killer Robert Bowers hated from because he felt troubles to surrounded by Jews\nAnother protester named Suzanne has offered a said the president's a visit is not something that people here want\nHe has promoted more negativity than he has support and solidarity he's\nFostered an administration of white supremacy and he has not welcome here in our time of morning said one of the organizers\nI'm of the protest I look this is this is all crazy and wrong\nThere was a um a comment on uh\nThe the buzzfeed from one of the protesters who is they're trying to say to the president not to get off the plane in Pittsburgh\nAnd the protesters said uh I'm here to honor the eleven people who were lost a hatred and to send a message to Trump was fanned the flames of hate and is partially responsible for this tragedy see if they repeated enough it becomes kind of a reality in people's\nMinds and and that is is wrong and it's despicable and it it leads to to craziness\nAn ... it it truly does I mean if someone wants to explain to me how Trump is responsible for this tragedy by a classic in his mind\nAnd and somebody who was so anti Semitic city a totally rejected\nTrump it's outrageous and it's\nOutrageous enough that it can lead the kind of thing that you hear from Jim Carey who used to be a talented actor\nAnd used to be a very funny comedian and now\nHe's just won the

to be crucial\nIn these last remaining days the campaign is this and it's one of the reasons by the way I I haven't talked about President Trump talking about birthright citizenship\nBecause I think the idea that he needed birthright citizenship to get the basics cited the base for President Trump is already excited to anybody who cares about birthright citizenship is an issue is already voting

is worse than that because it's just completely unrelated to the subject of course\nBut here's the worst part a majority fifty three percent and the survey said they often felt intimidated in sharing their ideas opinions or beliefs in class because their ideas and beliefs were different from those of their professors\nA slightly larger majority feared expressing themselves because of differences

Eighteen [noise] seven days\nTill the election I Am ... leave since show while there is idiocy in there is ignorance\nIf I hear one more journalists say we cannot change birthright citizenship because of the fourteenth amendment I could scream how many times did I see Shepard Smith on Fox today say that again and again smuggling criticizing Donald Trump\nSaying he and Lindsey Graham who supports the president on this can't change the law birthright citizenship\nBecause of the fourteenth amendment too many times and Smith is not alone the smoking is\nOf everyone who just thinks that can site to the fourteenth amendment\nAnd show the department of justice the president and his White House counsel's offices idiots while they are just wrong\nAgain folks my rule of something looks too easy or too outrageous to be true it usually is so let's go to the fourteenth amendment Shepard Smith and so many others today said require citizenship by geographic birth here it reads exactly this quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction of their of our citizens of the United states and the state we're in they reside\nNow Smith and the folks on CBS this morning I watched read the first clause quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and then they say are citizens of the United states close quote\nBut that's not what the fourteenth amendment sets they're ignoring or lighting or rendering irrelevant that little Claus in there that reads and subject to the jurisdiction there of\nDo they think it's irrelevant did they think it's meaningless do they not know how to read or research\nFor years at least two decades there's been a tremendous rise in scholarship on the origins and meanings and import of that very clause because we know one big true thing about the constitution as much as we know what about the Bible there are no unnecessary or relevance statements in either\nWell we do have access to these things to know what the frame or is the writers of the fourteenth amendment meant so let's go to the expert who decades ago started this research at ... earlier of the Claremont Institute and I will yield to him but before I Do let's also instruct\nOur friends in journalism that there's a section five to the fourteenth amendment as well go read it\nIt allows nay instructs the U.S Congress with the power to define and an act the other provisions of the fourteenth amendment so we'll get to executive orders in a moment\nBut the statement that you need a constitutional amendment to change the practices are implementation of the fourteenth amendment rather than an act of Congress are simply constitutionally black letter law incorrect\nSo to professor earlier on the meaning of that phrase everyone wants to just ignore he writes today we somehow have come to believe that anyone born within the geographical limits of the U. S. is automatically subject to its jurisdiction\nBut this renders the jurisdiction clause utterly superfluous if this had been the intention of the framers of the fourteenth amendment presumably they would have said simply that all persons born or naturalized in the U. S. are thereby citizens\nThey did not write that\nIndeed [noise] during the debate over the amendment senator senator Jacob power to the author of the citizenship clause attempted to assure skeptical colleagues\nThat the language was not intended to make Indians citizens of the United states Indians Howard conceded were born within the nation's geographical limits to be sure but he steadfastly maintained that they were not subject to its jurisdiction\nBecause they owed allegiance to their tribes and not the United states\nSenator Lyman Trumbull chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee supported this view arguing that quote subject to the jurisdiction there of men to not only allegiance to anybody else and being subject to this complete jurisdiction of the United states\nJurisdiction understood as allegiance senator Howard explained excludes not only Indians but persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ... or foreign ministers\nLast subject to the jurisdiction does not simply mean 'cause it's commonly thought subject to American laws or courts it means owing exclusive political allegiance to the United states\nFurthermore there has never been an explicit holding by the Supreme Court that the children of illegal aliens are automatically accorded birthright citizenship\nIn the case of long Kim arc which so many site to the court ruled that a child born in the U.S of illegal aliens was entitled to birthright citizenship under the fourteenth amendment\nThis was a five to four opinion\nWhich provoked the descent of cheese chief justice Melvin fuller who argued that contrary to the reasoning of the majority is holding the fourteenth amendment did not in fact adopt the common law understanding a birthright citizenship is difficult to imagine\nThat the framers of the fourteenth amendment intended to confer the Buena citizenship on the children of illegal aliens when they explicitly denied that ballooned to Indians who had been born here and whose parents had been born here\nThose who defied the laws of the u._s. should not be allowed to confer such an advantage on their children this would not be visiting the sense of the parents on the children as is often claimed since the children of illegal aliens born in the U.S would not be denied anything to which they otherwise would have a right\nThere are a legion should follow that of their parents during their minority\nA nation that cannot determine who becomes a citizen or believes that it must allow the children of those who defy its laws to become citizens is simply no longer a sovereign nation no one is advocating that those who have been granted birthright citizenship should be stripped of their citizenship\nEqual protection considerations would counsel that citizenship points granted is vested in cannot be revoked\nThis I Believe is eminently adjust the proposal to and birth right citizenship is ... perspective only for the future only\nThank you professor now this gets us to whether the president can do this by executive order or not I think it's possible but let me warn I'm not sure it's wise I usually start with the test Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson is shooting the Youngstown steel seizure case of Nineteen fifty two\nThey're Jackson wrote one when the president asked pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress his authority is at its maximum for ... includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate\nTo when the president acts and absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority he can only rely upon his own independent powers but there is a zone of twilight in which he in Congress may have concurrent authority or in which it's distribution is uncertain\nTherefore congressional inertia indifference or cui essence may sometimes at least as a practical matter enable if not invite measures on independent presidential responsibility in this area any actual tests to power is likely to depend on the imperative\n... on the imperatives events in contemporary ... rather than on abstract theories of law for ...\nWhen the president takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress his power is at its lowest before then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter\nCourts can sustain exclusive presidential control in such a case only by disabling the Congress from\nActing on the subject so where does this leave us there is no on point Supreme Court case justifying the practice of birthright citizenship to illegal alien children\nBut there was also no question that the practices long standing and I think we would all agree the will of Congress very divided\nNot just among not just between Democrats and Republicans but even among Republicans see Paul Ryan's comments today\nKen the president do this by executive order\nOh yeah he bragged about the use of executive orders remember I own and apparently\nThey want to just just loud and you're out his reading of this is wonderful he can do this yes he's going to protect the borders\nAnd it and and now she's ... and the president is now also forcing people who've never picked up\nYou know a a copy of the constitution let alone read it or it can even understand it I mean to some throughout where's the fourteenth amendment oh what is it actually say oh well you just read the first paragraph that's what it says okay okay now I'm an expert and\nBut it's it's pretty funny Allen it's pretty funny I mean they just allied over ... even in that first sentence I mean I was watching journalist after journalist put it up on the screen and highlight one of them I think he was on CBS this morning they even highlighted in\nYellow the all the provisions except the one in right there in the middle right off the subject to the jurisdiction there or do they think it doesn't mean anything to the north\nRight right do they think it does it mean anything you know they don't get it it's\nNot that they don't know what it means you know they've been ill go our you know their mal educated\nYou clearly have heard this argument you're you're familiar with the debate over this yeah clearly you know what it means and clearly you know I'm not an immigration expert I I'd like to think I Know a few things about ... and stuff but\nI mean this debate shouldnt be hard for people to find its been raging in the press and in the think tank community for twenty twenty five years\nAnd and you know it's very interesting is the fact that there's no real trusting dental case out there for this\nI Know there is and isn't that isn't that interesting which by the way argues in Trump's favor towards the executive order again I think it was it's it's it's not the best thing in the world to do it this way because of long standing\nPolicy in practice but it's not like he's over ruling the Supreme Court there is no Supreme Court ruling on this you are absolutely right\nSo that puts him in a lot of good dead you know he he he says things\nAnd it's like throwing a big old rock and the odd man he makes we're all going out in every direction but the rock was the right road and\nDo these journalists just think his White House counsel and department of justice are just so idiotic and they're smarter than them oh well we we ... would they know who knows what they say well here's the fourteenth amendment we know more\nDo they just anything can throw it off in a sentence and Shepard Smith can say well not without three fourths of the Senate and the house you know two thirds of the Senate and house in three fourths of the state he can't say the care\nThey ... they are clueless as to what their powers they think they all are a lot smarter than they really they really do and it's All right that's what you have a great afternoon\nOh well I really appreciate the call and you do the same your weight loss or I'd rather have a good one thinks who's next bill was in Scottsdale Hi Bill\nHow you doing

advertising this is great\nBill I Love it [laughter]\nI'll disagree with your last caller Allen yeah I think\nThat they know exactly why that is actually caused me when they leave it out if they didn't understand it they weren't just including\nI'll tell you what I think I'll tell you what I think it's kind of in between you are now and I think they think it doesn't matter and it's just extra legal lease I I think that's what they think\nWell I think some of them but I think listen they they they are topic and she\nYou know while you're only going to say that oh bill and hit the brake can
