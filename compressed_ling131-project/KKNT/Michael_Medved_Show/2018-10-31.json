{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "Is famous for saying facts are stubborn things well words are stubborn things they have a clear meaning where is there any doubt\nI mean real down about what um what this means um\nThe constitution the United states in the fourteenth amendment which was adopted Nineteen sixty eight says\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and other state where they reside\nAnd here's a ... basically what people say on the other side they say well but it's a subject to the jurisdiction there of the reason they included that is they want it to exclude the children of ambassadors people who had a clear affiliation with a another country\nAnd all by by that context I think that they could say that someone who is growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is left the United states and live the rest of his life in\nSomewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now people whose parents were not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented\nIs clearly a loser and there's a great great editorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point the real point about this is that there is neither\nPolitical will no judicial will to do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump is on very strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground and virtually all Republicans and nearly all Americans agree with that nobody wants to throw the door is open to everybody nobody wants to remove borders\nI shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe of the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works that's the kind of thing you can win\nThe by the way they they did some fake news today on CNN or they said that well and in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true he would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not\nPossible birthright citizenship is not going to change 'em\nIf Mr Trump wants to end the practices of Wall Street journal and again nothing new York Times of Wall Street journal which has been very supportive of President Trump generally because Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism\nHe can always dress in campaign for a constitutional amendment but Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less than an amendment to the constitution so he's making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day\nMr Trump made a political mistake this year by not trading legal status to adult immigrants brought here illegally as children for more border security then Republicans going to run on an immigration accomplishment and said he wanted the political issue and will ... will soon see how well that worked\nBut here's my basic point about this politically\nI don't think there's anyone who was excited by President Trump saying he's going to address birth tourism who wasn't already supporting President Trump who wasn't already supporting a Republican and getting people excited over this by the way I Do think it would be possible to curb birth tourism\nBy enacting some legislation around it saying that in special circumstances where people are traveling to the United states not for the purpose of long term residency but simply to give birth to a\nChild here in the United states menu can question whether that child really is in the jurisdiction of the United states and that's okay but generally to challenge the idea that a child born to someone who has lived here for\nTen years and where the child grows up entirely in the United states you want to try to challenge the citizenship status of that individual why not make\nMore citizens who are actually committed to this country and so make sure that there is some kind of commitment or naturalization if need be but uh if there is any\nDown for the parents but creating a process where people can go through American innovation it seems to me is much better than obliterate in the idea of citizenship as some Democrats seem to want to do or the idea of changing the constitution\nTo change the status of people who were born here whose parents may not have had the right to come here and the first place and we'll be

Klux Klan cost and would be offensive not very many be offensive to everybody\nEverybody yeah right so like we don't like that yeah I can see that\nAnd what about the um there was a gentleman and he he posted it a very prominently on Facebook in fact his wife's Facebook profile a profile has her husband dressed up in his Halloween costume which is a very realistic cost him was an SS officer or an officer of ah\nOf ah the ah the basically the shock troops the storm troopers for adults Hitler and then they had their five year old dressed up as Adolph Hitler or nay I'm actually have now trying to apologize uh yeah they didn't\nHire if that was in Kentucky [laughter] yeah I I Know and I think that is inappropriate especially get sent a guy I mean it's like no you don't do that\nRight there was a rabbi and nearby Evansville, Indiana who said the rule of thumb is don't dress up for Halloween um in in a way that in in any way of books the memory of the blue actually murdered millions of people um okay so\nThat is that what Halloween and for most everybody I mean come on you're calling out the exception the ones who were the bad boys at the holiday but there are millions of people enjoy it and who have a great time and ... benign costumes and to have time to meet their neighbors and get together and and sheriff's insider and candy corn so it's not\nNot the way you're portraying it\nOkay I Know that people who sometimes and let me make clear that traditionally I'm I'm not a big fan of Halloween I Would if a left my own devices pretty much ignore the holiday [noise] my wife for whatever reason likes it\nAnd I know you like it because like you're going to go out trick or treating later with our granddaughter and I will admit that sounds perfectly nice and benign\nBut what if she sees costumes that scare her what is it I don't know what she's dressing as what you're wearing\nShoes dressing up as a lady buck oh call that one I'm going to\nBe ... yeah the species appropriation\n[laughter] what she does ... like I said fine\nSo maybe she was trying to copy become a a lady bugs but uh I don't think that when it's offensive\nOkay and I I can understand that for a two year old is it'd be pretty interesting seeing people wearing all these different costumes but\nWhat about the emphasis of uh on blood ... um the the dark side of the supernatural or do you think that's a a wholesome ingredient to inject into our cultural bloodstream every year with this for\nCamp led a what look I'm not in favor personally I Do see a lot of our neighbors making mock graveyard on their front lawn and hanging out skeletons and data and having goes hand in their head jury\nUm I you know I think that they're not doing that just scare anyone I think they're doing because so very clear that these are not real\nIt's very clear that these are decorations for holiday that lets you know that there's death let's that there is a sort of a scary side to the the season changing into a dark and coal time of year\nAnd I don't think that that's negative credit people doing it they're doing it because I consider her and and I don't think it's hurtful to kids to see that\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number if you are a great fan of the Halloween holiday or a non fan of the Halloween holiday or you can join us in this exchange\nA one eight hundred nine five five Seventy seventies restore you can send us a tweet at a it's an md bed show on Twitter\nUm it it it does this Halloween coming right after the arrest of this bombing suspect and right after the the truly truly horrible events in Pittsburgh and it was just four days ago\nOr does it feel a little bit different I mean again with all the emphasis on graves and and funerals and skeletons I I I when I Walk in our neighbor and I know exactly where you're talking about a sweetie I mean there's a skeleton hanging from the tree\nI'm I don't see anything positive and that what's what's why is that a a a sort of a benign or worthwhile influence\nBut I wouldn't say that it was worthwhile influence I think it's an expression of a holiday but it's universally understood to be secular to be fun to be different from the rest of the holidays which are\nMore I'm upbeat and I don't think that it's meant to give the neighbors and they get a message at all and and I don't think it's in ... into the culture I think the culture than braced Halloween and sales for the holiday have increased every year because of the fact that it's an escape\nIt keeps it takes is out of the horrors that a great the newspaper front page it let it go into the world a fantasy that let tests I Do think that are fun like\nBobbing for Apple I mean there are things that happened on Halloween that or see how I remind us and the harvest reminders this time of year and that's a positive about the holiday\nOkay what did last time you have seen what people would call an appropriate movie Halloween a scary movie\nYou're asking me I don't go to scaring\nThe I don't want to match the negative and do you over the last thirty five years you\nKnow like scary movies are about other topics too you know that's just spent and slapstick attract considered pretty scary and violence in nearly every movie the only ones that I go to a rom coms\nI I understand but since you're so particular about movies I mean it's kind of\nHow it is not a celebration of scary stuff how Halloween celebration where kids go out in the neighborhood and they see each other all dressed up and they face paint on and they can put out a bag and say trick or\nLast year according to the last year I went to war with them and I bought my big to do\n[laughter] and I'm sure you've got a good hall\nAppreciate it did you what was your costume mark\n'em or last year ... God\nOr with a hippie uh-huh well that's the end there plenty of people who look like that in uh Seattle area there coal homeless people what uh let's see if homeless people come to your door trick or treating what's the appropriate response die\n[laughter] that's a good question I don't think I've ever seen that um I don't ... I mean I feel bad for them anybody has a right to dress up on my door begging for candy I I think have compassion for\nA a let's go to a a Tessa in snow Paul me Washington You're on the Michael ... show hello Tessa\nHi Michael I think that's ridiculous to the here and say that the kids are learning to panhandle during Halloween I mean you can say that for every holiday that's out there couldn't list you're asking him to sit on a strange land flap Easter you're sitting here telling them take food off the ground\nFourth of July you're telling them it's OK to set things on fire [laughter] I think it's a silly argument to sit here and say that panhandling is what we're teaching kids at that time\nWell extend out except most people generally and the and the rest of the year you would occasionally sit on somebody's lap and uh you would occasionally like different things on fire I don't know any other occasion and die You're welcome to jump in here\nAny any other occasion where you come up to people you may or may not know and a holdout a bag in effect on the books and bird\nThough it's generosity between neighbors you're sitting here having an open and fun time and you know kids that are younger obviously do it under supervision and then what the older kids I'd rather have my teenagers go trick or treating than going out in the neighborhood move causing trouble\n...\nThings like that as well the thing that makes its day difference is that it is one day set aside here never fully recognize as a time of being appropriate to go in the neighborhood\nWe all recognize it together that that we expect to have kids and knocking on the door asking for candy it's not a big surprise where he just jumps in front of the door and say give me your candy\nIt's something that we all choose to go here and we choose to participate in and those are down to turn off the porch light\nLet's go to Tom Glenn door or California Hello Tom you're on the bed show with the ...\nThank you very much Michael\nDoctors and you did a really good job in totally decimate ing Michael's panhandling argument of a sudden you were right up there in intellectual really is with your husband's a total is very complimented thank you so it's absolutely true\nMichael I Would appeal to you on this basis my dear wife said just a few minutes ago the end of it for a second hour she said it's um you know you wouldn't Michael have one thing in common I said what do you mean your vote totally enthralled with your grandchildren and that's the basis of my argument\nWell okay I Will admit it the prospect of Julia dressing up as a lady bugs and going through your reading for the first time [noise]\nIt's it's pretty appealing [laughter] be honest about it [noise] but I still don't like the whole focus on the holiday what about the day of the dead aspect of Halloween we'll get to that and more on the great Halloween\n[noise] Ninety sixty\nOreo con president heading back at

... and our great Halloween debate a and if you can put on the psychologist had for a moment let's say someone comes to the door\nAnd and it's not a tiny little kid it's ah you know twelve Thirteen year old something like that and the child is wearing a costume that you find culturally insensitive or inappropriate ... someone comes to the door and this has happened I've seen this\nIn a um somewhere arrow with a a little shoe polish or magic marker mustache and a sort of dressed like you'll pardon the expression the free to a ...\nA ... should you express something to the child about an inappropriate Halloween costume of you deem some costume inappropriate\nAnd then you can come and help celebrate at the conclusion of this campaign and we promise not to talk about Halloween because it'll be after Halloween\nOkay Michael this is your producer Greg speaking right now I have to ask you two are millions of listeners all across the country because I just caught you talking to your wife Diane off the air trying to convince her\nThat it was okay to give out year old candy to trick or treaters tonight that is an injustice beyond anything that's going on in this country right now [laughter] but we look\nWe we won't I won't say well my dad was Diane was resisting at this was this is the point she always over by is getting better buying all this candy yeah good for her that's going to but again how much do you want to give to these little kids you don't want\nThe ... at home to have the reputation of the expired candy you want them you want to change size Reese's peanut butter cups so everybody praises\nOkay well I don't know about the Reese's peanut butter cups do have the advantage of being kosher but an appointed look Barbra Streisand right now is out there trying to blame Trump for making her fat that's what you said okay and I don't want anyone to ah to to blame us for anything like that what do you say die well\nFirst of all I agree with Greg that we have to have fresh candy [laughter] so anybody who is considering temperate treating at our house you have not nothing to fear [laughter] as second second I have to have enough candy one of the worst thing is when you get a group of fifty kids can only forty of 'em\nGet ... kid that's not a group that's a gang\nOkay yeah yeah yeah we've had we've had that we've had bad\nYeah man that's a ... a mob yeah right what if what if they're uh they're they're brought up by the way I don't I I Do think you know my guess is and I don't know we'll see and we'll get reports from our listeners\nI don't think they're going to be many political costumes this year though the politics doesn't seem to be a lot of fun right now right\nNow I I agree with you in fact you know that they have reports of the sales and the last half costumes and as always princess and superhero and Star Wars\nIn which it or not that's not actually on the kids kind of left at all really which is the number one cost him for adults in fact ten percent of adults are going to go as a which\n... which is that part of the idea\nNo no it doesn't say sexy way I'm going into which tonight\n[laughter]\nAnd the most because you don't really need to\nBuy much I'm so cheap I don't want to actually pay for a class you gets where something black and get a make a pointy hats so [laughter]\nAnd uh yeah but no no a Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi [laughter]\nThat would be rude\nYes let's go to um I'm Becky in Phoenix you're on the Michael ... that show was doctored I Am at that\nHigh I just wanted to tell you that I actually am enjoying the show I wanted to get back to the trick or treaters when they're all over the age of twelve and I would say even up to the Eighteen\nYou know I Would much rather have them come trick or treat at my door then to add them out doing other stuff like I'm getting in trouble because if they're reading at your door they're less likely to be in trouble\nI'm On a number to go ahead\nI I'm not I'm not sure that they kind of kids who get into trouble will say oh yeah let's go trick or treating and instead of I mean people are meant they teenagers are members of gangs or involved and I'm a bad behavior probably not likely to come to your doors trick or treaters\nOh no I I I understand I trust me I I drive a bus a publicly and uh for a bus driver and I I see all kinds of people [laughter] so um I understand that totally but what I\nThink some of those some of those rough people can kind of put that aside for one night a good clean fun on Halloween\nOh I've I've I've got a pocket of candy to pass out my passenger\n... probably not year old candy\n[laughter] no no no it's dollar store candy but no\nThere there you go we're with you on that one Becky I appreciate your call and the other\nThing is is when they dress up as um as you know anything I mean in high school I remember the boys get to dress up as women or girls\nAnd we've all grown up to now we're all pretty normal people [laughter]\nSo I don't think it really matter I don't think they I don't think kids really understand the significance dressing up\nAs a here here's here's the point of it to a dying of you heard of this I Would imagine there are some people today if a guy dressed up as a girl would that be cultural appropriation from the transgender community\nAnd say you have to me that would be a stretch that would be a stretch like everyone it expects but this will be a day that you put on a costume can be somebody that you're not\nAnd so everybody can dress up as a sound to be a character can be someone who is a them and say\nOkay and and I can I can attest that as a a senatorial candidate once said Diane you are not a which we will be right back with Dr Diane med vet a few

congressional district in nine where not only I live ... from where we broadcast Steve Ferrara he's going to be joining us in the second tower [noise]\nUh I hate to make big or small thing but sometimes small things do say big things [noise] and I was caught by an advertisement today television advertisement today political advertisement on behalf of care students cinema Democrat running for Senate [noise]\nIn that ad or it was it was featured former attorney general of the state of Arizona named grant woods\nAnd grant woods on TBS ... calls himself a Republican or a Republican for years and cinema and it raised my eyebrows\nBecause of several things not the least of which was an op ed he wrote in the Arizona Republic a month ago in September where he said he would no longer affiliated with the Republican Party\nI Want to go through that operate a little bit but how do you call yourself a Republican for Kirsten Sinema when you wrote an op ed a month ago saying you can no longer affiliated with the Republican Party [noise]\nIndeed I'll read you his words and just a moment but it gets us to something I Want to talk about more on this monologue\nWhich is what it means to be a Republican and what it means to be a conservative grant which was the attorney general in Arizona from Nineteen Ninety One to Nineteen Ninety nine and in his op ed from a month ago\nHe does some interesting things right some interesting things or he talks about possibly running for the U.S Senate\nA next time there was an open seat which could very well be next November ... a year from now or to fill the seat of his longtime friend\nJohn McCain he writes I've been on the sidelines for Twenty years in his op ed I've been on the sidelines for Twenty years well he hasn't been on the sidelines for Twenty years [noise]\nUm I remember well\nTwo years ago when he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and in his statement this Republicans said she has the most qualified person\nTo ever run for president I think that's a lie I think that is belied by any historical analysis whatsoever I can off the top of my head think of plenty of people who were more qualified\nTo run for president how about a former member of the house of representatives who was a former U.S senator who was a former vice president of the United states for two terms\nRichard Nixon for example how is she more qualified than Richard Nixon or a two the two term governor of California named Ronald Reagan I mean we can just go on and on it's a silly stupid statement\nBut to say you've been on the sidelines when you as a Republican two years ago endorsed Hillary Clinton for president\nWould be to belied the truth or how about four years ago when he as a Republican endorsed Democrat Fred Duvall for governor against the juicy was that being on the sidelines know demand is not an hasn't been on the sidelines [noise]\nHe then writes in his op ed from a month ago\nIs it acceptable to remain on the sidelines anymore especially in a time of national crisis the crisis what's the national crisis we have spent a lot of time here discussing\nThe issue that the left has an investment is invested in us being in a constant state of agitation and stirring things up we played that great mash up yesterday of CNN and MSNBC\nAnd a leading um national television news\nNetworks talking about the crisis sees we've been in the beginning of the end for the Trump presidency\nAh the the laws are caving in on Donald Trump all throughout to sixteen twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen up until now all nonsense all total nonsense continual and continuous hysteria [noise]\nThis is this is not far from the Marxist notion of the permanent revolution we have to be constantly agitated they love at\nThe national crisis two people who say we are in a national crisis is nothing more nothing more than um the fact that they didn't win the presidency and twenty sixteen and our conservative did a Republican did [noise]\nSo in his op ed I'm he talks about running for Senate and he thinks he's states I Will run as an independent and I will have to decide soon he then writes quote why not stay in the Republican Party\nAnd try to change it from within it's reasonable to consider but I don't think it's possible\nBarry Goldwater couldn't win a Republican primary today a principled conservative like Jeff Flake decided that he couldn't either well we've talked about Goldwater and the ... and the myth that he couldn't win today there's no way to project\nBut if you read what Goldwater wrote in his book conscience of a conservative [noise] if you listen to him when he was in the Senate and you look at his votes when he was in the Senate I think of course he would win I think we miss him very very much [noise]\nAs far as Jeff Flake being a principled conservative that's a matter of opinion but the man was pulling it Seventeen percent and that just tells me that\nSomeone a right here and I'm thinking the Seventeen percent to approve may have some self\nReflection to engage in grant woods writes I have the option of running as an independent it suits me would be a lot of fun if I don't run as an independent than I Will switch to a Democrat\nOkay fine I don't mind you switch you know I\nSaw that Shakespeare said he's good being gone but don't run ads for Kirsten Sinema saying you're a Republican a month after writing that that's just not true it's just not true [noise]\nNow this takes me to a much bigger issue a much bigger issue which is what does conservatism stand for these days and what does the Republican Party stands for these days Lee Edwards is a um old aid to\nBarry Goldwater he wrote the definitive biography of Barry Goldwater\nAnd he is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation having been an assistant to him and written many books including the definitive biography of cold water um he's in a very good place to talk about the history of conservatism and what it means today and he wrote an essay for national\nReview on justice point earlier this month I've been meaning to get to it he writes um\nThere are basically for sources for modern day conservatism\nOr some of you will either have had to of read some history of the conservative movement or have been conservatives for a long time and be over the age of fifty to know some of these references but he starts with one\nThe Sharon statements drafted by Stan Evans and adopted by the young Americans for freedom at its sounding meeting in September Nineteen sixty sharing because it was a Bill Buckley house insurance Connecticut [noise]\nTo Russell kirks the conservative mind which says that the essence of conservatism lies in six cannons which I Would like to talk about three Barry Goldwater's the conscience of a conservative which talks about the two sides of man the material and the spiritual\nAnd for William Buckley ... book up from the liberalism [noise]\nUm the Sharon Statement is probably the best place to begin [noise] and it's from Nineteen sixty as we said and I want you to think about this in the context\nIf today's Republican Party and conservative movement which many people think has been abandoned one that foremost among the trans ... transcendent values as an individual use of his God given free will once the derives his right to be free from the strict restrictions of arbitrary force\nTo that liberty is indivisible and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom\nThree that the purpose of government is to protect those freedoms through the preservation of internal order the provision of national defense and the administration of justice\nFive that the constitution of the United states is the best arrangement ... devised for empowering government to fulfill its proper role while we'll straining it from the concentration and abuse of power\nSix that the market economy allocating resources by the free play of supply and demand is the single economic economic system compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government\nAnd that it is at the same time the most productive supplier of human nature\nAnd finally said American foreign policy must be judged by the criterion does it served the just interest to the United states which one of those principles has been banned [noise] and if you were a Republican from Nineteen Ninety One in Nineteen Ninety nine serving in office as such right on the heels of the Reagan Revolution [noise]\nI think of something else I'm it means to me a a lot more deference to international trees it means to me a lot more foreign intervention\nUm that that's what I understand it to mean I'm I have never felt you know that it meant anything beyond that I've never thought it meant anything beyond that and the word\nNever particularly meant much to me a ... you know I worry when we lose our sovereignty and I think sovereign to us sovereignty and exceptionalism is the opposite of what I've always thought and understood\nThe phrase globalism to mean and if I'm wrong about that or if other people have different interpretations of it that's fine but that's why we're never bothered me that much I have long been worried about too much untangle months\nI'm as George Washington was in his farewell address I have long been worried about the um\nSuppressing our sovereignty and reducing our sovereignty to international treaties and to the United nations um I have long worried about that because I think the United nations is in George will's phrase [noise]\nNothing more than a cargo of third a gaggle of third world authoritarianism I always thought it was a dangerous place where a minority rights can be superseded by authoritarianism of the majority\nAnd that I think is what Daniel Patrick Moynihan has worried about I think that's where Jeane Kirkpatrick has worried about they've written books and given great speeches on that so to Nikki Haley a show it's never been a dog whistle to me the interesting thing about this notion of dog whistles\nThat CNN likes to talk about when Donald Trump uses the word nationalist let's say but that's a dog with so many white nationalist well you can say anything's a dog whistle\nDonald Trump is never said white nationalist beyond the people who throw the word white in there are people at CNN and New York times in the Washington Post\nAnd you can graft honor forced onto someone anything they didn't say and say well he really means that but do you know what that makes you there is a phrase for what that makes you there is a phrase for that person\nThat phrase\nIs conspiracy theorist you are a conspiracy theorist if you have no evidence if you have no proof of someone saying something but you know somehow deep down in your own heart departure soul soul so that's what they really really mean\nThan you are conspiracy theorists and you're a conspiracy theory is fear is beyond that\nWhen that person's actions\nWhen their actions be lie and betray everything you say they actually stand [noise]\nSo you know feel free to live in your dreamland feel free to live in your palace fiction [noise] just don't try and tell us it's reality because you're taking yourself you are taking yourself out\nOf the place of responsible political rhetoric I'm leaps and we'll be right back\nAnd ash and the\nNinety sixty no matter how are you calling for the Pentagon said more active duty troops to the U.S Mexican border by thousands would lead to play by we've been
