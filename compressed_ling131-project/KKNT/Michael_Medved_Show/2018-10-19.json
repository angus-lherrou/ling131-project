about\nSaturday that twelve PM right here on nine sixty the patriots [noise]\n[noise] [noise] um [noise] going\nAnd another great day and the greatest nation on God's green earth a great day for the movie industry why be cause\nThey're releasing a film today\nIt's very eagerly awaited and the national review find conservative magazine\nFilm as perhaps the most negatively unapologetically right wing movie of the year [noise]\nBelieve it or not we're talking about Halloween it's the tense sequel\nA Kyle Smith over a National Review says [noise] Halloween as a gung ho gun loving liberal Roland capital punishment backing conservative manifesto [noise]\nIn the format of a slasher flick\nIt's the kind of movie where if someone says they'd rather have dance lessons than shooting practice\nHe'll soon be corrected\nOkay um is a movie worth seeing we will get to it will be reviewing Halloween Jamie Lee Curtis is back she started her movies were forty years ago playing a Laurie Strode and now she's back in this new film we will get to that\nBut first summer awards their tangentially movie related but ah they're very prestigious certainly much more so in the Academy Awards we're talking golden turkey award [noise]\n\nThe Academy Awards first and foremost thank God I Believe the living room and I would like to thank my wonderful aging more powerful the people's choice\nI Would like to share this with every single senator\nIt's time for another injured the orange nomination [noise]\n\nKnees or go literally there was a series of them uh the go to a major American corporation to ah the responding to a major American columnist\nAnd to a number of movie stars regarding Disney Princess is first of all the major American\nCorporation is um uh this is really remarkable the Kleenex company\nI had been on aware of is I guess I missed out because I don't know maybe I had a sheltered upbringing or did you know that man's size clean X was a thing Greg did you know about ... you're a man's eyes guy and a\nAnd you know no man's eyes Kleenex for for okay well no man's eyes clinics anymore for anybody I'm Kimberley Clark the parent company Kleenex said it received a consistent increase of complains about the branding firm in size Kleenex\nKleenex men's eyes to shows have been on shelves for the past sixty years at a state within the company over that time the brand has always been characterized by a much larger tissue size which is both soft and strong the companies and their statement\nKimberly Clark and no way suggested being both soft and strong isn't exclusively masculine trade nor do we believe that the men size branding suggests or endorses gender inequality\nHowever they are dropping manned size clean actually they are now going to be called Kleenex extra large\nDo I believe that this is a tragedy know do I think that this is a raid on our cultural patrimony no\nBut is it silly and stupid and pathetic and strange to think of a company wasting serious money to respond to how many complaints you think they received on the issue of man sized Kleenex ... how many complaints does it take to get you to change something like that that's been there for sixty years\nI mean\nSo now you're just a Kleenex extra large I guess it's more descriptive she hadn't men [noise]\nOkay um [noise] we that gets us back into this whole transgendered issue and we're not going to go there right now I'm another bit of political correctness I Can't believe it I you know dear Abby has continued despite the fact that Abigail Van Buren\nA desire to the column anymore the original dear Abby now and the call has been taken over by genes Philips who is the daughter of the original dear Abby but she was asked a question about a very complicated elaborate foreign sounding name\nThat someone was considering giving a child and dear Abby said this\nNot only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but they can also call a trial called a child to be teased on mercifully\nSometimes the name can be problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful and a foreign language can be grading English by the way when I read that I immediately thought of of a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew name Israeli name is ... and a ... or more run I mean but seriously you don't want to name your daughter\nOr your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture that probably better name to choose now the point about this dear Abby thing is all hell has broken lose for dear Abby\nPeople have claimed that she is affirming white privilege that there is a racial thing and there's no racial and what she said\nBut of course the New York times is ready to make it racial\nThey have a column that says I'm the heated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American household for decades\nAnd was started by ms Philips mother use a pen name Abigail Van Buren this sheet of reaction has inspired a fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism\nAbby's column was deeply infuriating and also regulatory said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower\nAbby as clean to an old America were white\nIs considered the norm and everything else deviant an inferior Musk our added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and to connect them to that heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay that's fine Abby was not suggesting that anyone is just giving advice do I think it's reasonable advice sure\nDo we have very very dear friends who have given or their children very difficult names we do absolutely and you get used to in\nA and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the names of your children okay then him their kids after inanimate objects penny\nA river and Jonas but none of those names or that hard to spell or though I don't know may be probably people there are probably the blue spell penny wrong\nBut not many uh okay that's the point about the point about this it it just seems to me is why is everything about race well because people make it about race they a quote someone named a non\n... he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism he says is the reality is that a lot of this has to do with names\nBut more with white and is there a lot of complicated names from polish in Russian and Italian and German background then it becomes second nature to Americans\nThe unusual names referred to in the dear Abby column aren't unique in their complexity he said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't white\nThat as nonsense I I mean I I think it's very difficult if ah if somebody and they are all kinds of names which could understand would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name is difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle ... on his his name was Moshe med vet and he changed his name\nTo ... more stuff and that was the way he\nDid business 'cause it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for bear is dogs and the Russian word for bears meant that yes yet so okay\nThis seems to me inane but then we have we have this and this is a piece in the Washington Post\nAs sexual assault survivors continue to share their stories sparking worldwide have to ask me to reckoning\nActress Kristen Bell who was one of the voices and frozen of course is publicly expressing concern about Snow White and the prince who kiss Snow White without consent\n[noise] well that's a Michael or they could take my call or if you if you don't thank\nMe telling people to go out and get people and get a patient restaurant which I think directly led to the shooting of that guy the baseball field you don't think that evil and the person that said that is an evil\nAs a Tim you're totally distorting things obviously the shooting at the at the baseball field was evil Maxine Waters made that comment about getting in people's faces months after that happened and after the matter is that\nA lot for the all along anyway I don't I don't have a liberal for years okay avenue committed perjury\nOkay our at least the minute you don't cut me off on this I have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think would happen that little girl minute that comes from politicians politicians are currently eagle gods now you don't gods now\nYou know God's Nell as evil but guns now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look or Tim the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do is sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life in prison and that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder as adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen\nYou can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this that I think is profoundly wrong\nBut see we we lose the battle to him if we lose the language and evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who are\nAt literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that ah Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you could argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people had an and there were people\nOf this nature or stolen was evil Hitler was evil\nSo why is it that we sent millions of dollars billions of dollars worth of equipment and support and supplies to stall and so that he could beat Hitler answer because it was necessary for saving the world\nAnd uh there was one danger that was more immediate at the time that that happened I mean well uh there is a a new TV show that tries to focus on God\nAnd social media [noise] didn't know you could find on on social media ... speaking with a producer of God friended me coming right

friend in May of Steven thanks very much for joining us\nYeah absolutely happened to be here thanks for having me\nI'm at the uh I I we don't want to spoil or I'm certainly not the ultimate spoiler but the the interesting premise here is that um that God has friended the main character who was an atheist atheist son of a pastor that happens all the time uh\nSome fits with all the way this is the tens sequels are been eleven and these movies\nBut you know what this is the best ones in the original I was just clearly is it's it's it's really a shockingly good film why well basically what the film sets up the original film\nIs a\nFright tension psychological tension this um\nEvil evil psycho\nGets out of prison he wears a mask and implant cuddly and inexplicably he's going after people one of those people is played by a Jamie Lee Curtis she's playing Laurie Strode\nBut now she's a grandmother but determined not to let Michael Meyers newly escaped finishes job\nMichael my games who returned to home I Need to protect my family was real money for this problem it is not safe to be on the street tonight\nIs a killer but he will be killed tonight happy Halloween Michael\nOkay happy Halloween to everybody by the way is there's no goes teaser goblins there is an implication in this film that Michael could be the Boogie Man but basically\nHe uh he has a psycho\nWith a back story in the back stories alluded to here also which is that he murdered his sister and the first film\nWhen he was six years old so it was a troubled guy um look if you like this kind of movie at all this is a terrifically well done\nWhat's interesting is John ... is one of the producers but the real guiding force is a younger director named David Gordon Green has directed a bunch of independent films and he'd pineapple express what Seth Rogen but nothing preparing you for the expertise of this one one of the things that is really astonishing about the film when you think about it\nIs it's incredibly creepy is very disturbing as the kind of film my wife would hate every minute of\nBut it does what the best horror films do is it gets you to forget about your own troubles whatever they may be I mean if you're thinking about politics from Albany are annoyed about uh the Senate race or the governor's race in California plenty be annoyed about there [noise]\nUm and all of a sudden now you're thinking about wait a minute what's lurking behind that door that's been left a jar but the brilliance of the film is it is minimalist filmmaking this is not a body count movie there aren't that many people who get murdered and you don't see blood gushing forth with the big spouts of\nBlood it's subtle one of the most disturbing images in the film\nAt one point you don't know what's happened to a character and then you see someone dropping a bunch of removed bloody teeth on the floor and you can hear them wrestling on the floor\nIt's scary it's disturbing it's rated R A N Jamie Lee Curtis was outstanding she plays a grandmother ... oh yeah Kyle Smith over National Review\nSees this as a right wing movie because it's about certainly is about gun rights I mean this is part of what the film is about\nAnd it's about defending yourself and about how foolish it is to believe that the world is all full of sweetness and light and everyone is well intentioned there's also by the way of very surprising twist at the end involving one of the main characters\nAnd I won't even hint at it because the surprise when it comes to shocking to give away three stars\nFor Halloween or by the way it it basically clears away all those other inferior sequels in the middle because it says in the film wait Michael Meyers has been in this insane asylum for forty years said yup yup the as so all those other adventures in the other sequels forget about\nIs the one\nTo resource for the R rated Halloween or let us go to L. mud in Seattle Elmo you're on the Michael Mann that show\nMy garden

which is that it was equal line and down\nNo no I never called or evil I don't think Maxine is evil\nWhat did you ... would you that was I had a caller who called in who saw fault and Maxine was evil yeah yeah I I don't think Maxine is evil I've I've met her\nAnd by the way I Know I don't agree with her about anything but she is one of those members of Congress that people say very nice things about apparently she was a very nice kindly person that caller anti Maxine\nYeah we have our differences in a given but ... ... ... ... let's not even let them talk about it for a show like that in

Ronald Reagan for comes up a lot George Will for example once wrote that Ronald Reagan took a nervous American people on a clip or through a stormy see and that Reagan calm to both the people\nAnd the sea\nWater was important to Reagan and you get a great story about it in his farewell address to the nation in Nineteen eighty nine when he told the story of the boat people calling out to the American sailors and will play that audio a little later\nAnd of course well speaking of oceans creeks and sees let us not forget his decades long rendering of John when Trump's notion of America being a shining\nCity on a hill Reagan added the word shining\nI've always loved that image to but let's go back I'd been more says rendering of Ronald Reagan's pledge to God meant\nEdmund Morris wrote it meant a twin set of objectives at home to restore the American entrepreneurial spirit after fifty years of federal paternal of some abroad to display such a resolute contempt for Marxist Lenin Issam that it would follow Nazi has them into the ash sheep of history\nBoth were perceived as laugh a bleeding naive in Nineteen eighty one at least in those sharpen a fragrant areas of Manhattan and marine county where political issues are always described as complex\nThree years later the dream came true in a landslide re election in a landslide reelection amid such a blizzard of red and white and blue is had not been seen across America since v J day [noise]\nAnd after five years more sadly a little too late for Reagan to see it as president the evil empire began to self destruct just as he said it would\nEdmund Morris went on to write we became so positive a society under Reagan that we forgot how low are national morale has sunk before he raised his right hand on January twenty is Nineteen eighty one\nAnd by plane force of character reinvest it the presidency with authority and dignity in recent years we have seen the office belittled again but that is the way with democracy and its cycles big men are followed by small power gives way to dereliction\nThe republic survive ... for as long as it survives I think Reagan will be remembered with Truman and Jackson is one of the great populist presidents and instinctual leader who body and mind represented the better temper of the times\nAll of this is true I think a few other things as well\nHe truly did thinking mannequin terms the Soviet Union wasn't just bad or an enemy it was the evil empire\nAnd it's worth remembering he delivered that phrase at a conference of the national association of evangelicals I think his commitment to the unborn is often forgotten but he wrote a book a booklet on it when he was president and I don't think any other president wrote a book or booklet when they were president\nSo committed to the idea and right to life or see\nThe book was called abortion and the conscience of a nation\nI'll give you a slice of what he wrote he open but writing quote make no mistake abortion on demand is not a right guaranteed by the constitution no serious scholar including one disposed to agree with the court's result has argued that the framers of the constitution tended to create such a write\nShortly after the roe v Wade decision professor John Hart eagerly you lie now dean of Stanford law school wrote to the opinion is not constitutional law and gives almost sense of an obligation to try to be\nNowhere to the plain words of the constitution even hint at a rights so sweeping as to permit abortion up to the time the child is ready to be born\nYet that is what the court ruled as an act of raw judicial power the decision by the seven men majority in roe v Wade has so far been made to stick but the court's decision has by no means settled the debate instead ruby weight has become a continuing prior to the conscience of the nation\nClose quote he then compared roe versus Wade the Dred Scott and how long it took to come to grips with an overturn that decision many wrote quote what then is the real issue\nI've often said that when we talk about abortion we're talking about to live the life of the mother and the life of the unborn child why else do we call a pregnant woman a mother I have also said that anyone who doesn't feel sure whether we are talking about a second human life should clearly give life the benefit of the doubt\nIf you don't know whether a body is alive or dead you would never bury it I think this consideration itself should be enough for all of us to insist on protecting the unborn he went on\nThe case against abortion does not rest there however for medical practice confirms that every step the correctness of the moral sensibilities modern medicine treats the unborn child as a patient medical pioneers have made great breakthroughs in treating the unborn for genetic problems vitamin deficiencies irregular heartbeat and other medical conditions\nAnd who can forget George will's moving account to the little boy who underwent brain surgery six times during nine weeks\nBefore he was born who is the patient if not that tiny unborn human being who can feel pain when he or she is approached by doctors who come to kill rather than to cure\nHe went on and on and he closed the booklet this way quote Abraham Lincoln recognize that we could not survive a free land when some men could decides that others were not fit to be free and should therefore be slaves\nLikewise we cannot survive as a free nation when some men decide that others are not fit to live and should be abandoned to abortion or infanticide\nMy administration is dedicated the preservation of America's a free land and there was no cause more important for preserving that freedom than affirming the transgender right to life of all human beings the right without which no other have any meaning close quote\nBut I think at the end of the day to fully understand what turning his service to God meant what being a lifeguard for the world meant when it has to go to his farewell address and how we ended up he said how stands the city on this winter night more prosperous more secure and happier than it was eight years ago\nBut more than that after two hundred years two centuries she's still stands strong and true on the granite ridge\nEnter glow has held steady no matter what storm and she's still a beacon still a magnet for all who must have freedom for all the pilgrims from all the last places core hurdling through the darkness toward home\nWe've done our part as I Walk off into the city streets a final word to the men and women of the Reagan Revolution the men and women across America for eight years did the work that brought America back\nMy friends we did it we weren't just marking time we made a difference we made the city stronger we made the city freer and we left are in good hands all in all not bad not bad at all\nIt would not be uncommon for someone to have come from the south and said I never met a Republican\nIt's it ... it would not have been uncommon to hear that I'd never met a Republican up through the Nineteen middle of the Nineteen sixties\nUm the southern Democrats were very pro or obviously I'm federal\nPrograms like the new deal and even the great society and they allowed the Democrats to hold as one writer put a hold the house and Senate even when the party was at a severe disadvantage\nIn presidential elections um it's important to note that when Lyndon Johnson signed the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four he said something like we'll never have the south again as a party\nUm it is true that\nIf you were an African American or a black\nAnd you were looking for a political party for about a hundred years up until about Nineteen sixty four from about Eighteen sixty four to Nineteen sixty four if you were looking for a political party to be about safe of your rights\nYou would have almost always had been a Republican because it was the Republican Party of Lincoln all the way really threw up to and including the Nineteen sixty four civil rights act\nThat was the party of civil rights I'm people forget for example that it was Eisenhower Republican Eisenhower who sent you know a troops into the south to enforce um anti segregation judicial rulings like brown versus board\nUm the picture of um Wallace standing in front of a schoolhouse door these were all the resistance to to to desegregation we're we're all Democrats\nAnd the Dixiecrat party which is tablets itself in Nineteen forty eight I guess under Strom Thurmond\nWas a response to the Democratic party of Nineteen forty eight and Harry Truman a ... along with the help of senator Hubert Humphrey in putting a civil rights plank\nInto the Nineteen forty eight Democratic Party platform so these Democrats kind of walked away from that and created\nThe Dixiecrat party or Richard Nixon was one of the most popular Republicans in the African American community and there's an interesting piece of history about Eisenhower's reelection where they almost wanted the dumps Nixon\nSo that they would do better in the south isn't that interesting people forget that but basically um [noise] it's worth remembering up until Nineteen\nSixty Republican candidates for president got large double digit percentages\nOf the black vote [noise] um there's a lot more to say about this and I will do but I did books and guess who will pick it up a little bit in the second hour both some gas to answer something that I've been getting a lot of questions on ways [noise]\nCan I Do something on this thing called blocks change can I Do something that explains crypto currency bitcoin type stuff [noise]\nSo I picked to experts I Know for a friend to me in\nMind that the show and a villain mark [noise]\nThey've been on before and other issues and the other you know ah [noise] they're gonna do that with us for a little bit on this Friday overturned or what the southern Democrats was also get to the myth about the Republican Party some southern strategy as well [noise] I'm set leaps and we're covering a lot of we'll be right back [noise]\n\nNice sixty news [laughter] matter oriole calling
