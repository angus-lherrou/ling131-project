Oklahoma\nOr a list of some of the most outrageous federal government wastes and and it's tough to know where to begin a Adam do you have a personal favorite of all these wasted government programs wasteful government programs a Jew of spotlight in\nWell Michael thank you very much for our interests that are in our work it open the books dot com I think my favorite is that they're literally is a federal grant for everybody in this country in fact every single year the federal government doled out six hundred billion dollars worth of grants\nAnd if you're a prostitute and California one point four million dollars funded sex education for California prostitutes who could probably teach the class\nOf you know which which way it was a witch a department of government uh handles the a sex ed for California prostitutes\nThat's health and Human Services\nThat said they have a different direction of Human Services [laughter] right um so what ... what is the point how do they justify\nMuch money for sex ed from the prostitutes\nWas probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar ... overall every year ha Jeff doled out\nAbout four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective the U.S military every year at the department of defense or total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow a at it in terms of what you were talking about with open the books dot com\nYou have a a basic approach which is the transparency is the only way to solve this is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\nWell and that's that's the plan on the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal then at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take this three pronged approach and he should lead by example he should post all White House expenditures and then step to\nCut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel should report the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nBut I think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with the White House and this was something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous nuts in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff\nAt the President Roosevelt one world war two with a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today\nI I don't I don't get that at all but one what about can you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spent on that\nYou know the economy industry it's a very competitive industry\nBut I'm a two hundred thousand dollars floated or Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for a new condom designed this is just one of the graph now they're obviously a small company we did identify Michael\nThat the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies and the entire world certainly in this country that over a three year period they received three point three billion dollars worth of our money American taxpayer subsidies and they cannot argue that they need our money\nUh there's another one here which is a cigar taste test in Virginia for a hundred and fourteen thousand three hundred Seventy five dollars how could they hold the spending to just a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars for the cigar taste test\n[laughter] and there's a lot of studies like that one point one million dollars of our taxpayer money one to prepare Americans religions for the discovery of extraterrestrial life one million dollars went for a study on where it hurts the most to be stunned by be\nOkay well I guess is the theory is that if the government doesn't prepare you for the arrival of Esther extraterrestrials who will then we also spend money looking for extraterrestrial showing government my\nWell I think that was an inside deal that was twenty million dollars that the one that went to one of Harry Reid's friends and they went out looking for extraterrestrial life\nOkay people should should get involved with this and what I Love is the three pronged approach which is number one President Trump began by showing how every penny is spent in the White House and a number two he cuts the White House staff\nBy ten percent and then orders every other federal department cut by five percent and then number three he starts giving us updates every month on this war on waste because this is a war we can actually win\nIf you want to find out more about this uh go to our website to Michael ... dot com will link you write to open the books

Republicans together because the point is if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh\nHe is about as mainstream he's not somebody who's out there and we had um a fairly distinguished lawyer at our our at our table who had been part of the Ted Cruz campaign\nAnd uh he was at our table over the Sabbath and he pointed out that if you look at the names on that Heritage Foundation list\nBrett Kavanaugh was the most moderate person he could have possibly picked if you look at his judicial record\nHe is not someone on the extreme right at all he is a down the line like Samuel Alito like a

trying to come up with what I think the truly cultural political and point to or less than would be\nI had thought for example after the Clarence Thomas hearings whatever you thought whomever you believed the lesson was again whether Thomas did wouldn't need a hill accused him of or not\nThe lesson was the men were on more notice on how to behave in the workplace in positions of responsibility in positions of various hierarchies with female employees or co workers\nBut among those notices was that consent the idea of a female's consent or an employer employee or manager managing consent was not true consent\nBecause there could be a potential repercussion for not giving it and no consent is free consent if it is tied to a potential repercussion especially work related\nThat was the major lessen\nThe major lesson from the Robert Bork hearings was not to take the crowd from the Ted Kennedy's of the world not to accept distortions of record\nWhich we conservatives were ill equipped to fight given the lack of outlets on our side you know pre Internet pre Fox News pre talk radio\nSo we marshal those things and never again would conservatives have no outlet never again with the liberal dominated median culture have the run of the board free rein to run roughshod without a competing narrative or answer\nSo those two things buttoned up more or less the less found the ground we didn't know existed they expanded their territory if you will and they did it in a way we were again ill equipped for him because\nViolated all norms of common sense and decency and lack of common sense and lack of decency is not something we're familiar with so we didn't see it coming for example [noise]\nBack on the Clarence Thomas lesson we've learned there was an exception when the accused as a powerful Democrat like Bill Clinton\nIndeed uh some leftist even said as much that they believed Clinton to be guilty of all he was charged with him because he manned the barriers of roe versus Wade they would give them a pass\nFreedom from abuse freedom from violence freedom from sexual assault and workplace harassment in person hurting human rights\nThey all took a backseat to the preservation of roe v Wade which was not only something we didn't see\nComing as we didn't know those double standards existed but also was something that was never a risk anyway\nHonestly how many people to this moment never mind the moment of the Nineteen nineties truly think roe v Wade is at risk of being over turned and even if it is\nA tough but how many people think\nThat for those who actually need abortions they will not legally be able to get them I suppose we might have been put on notice for the Clinton double standard\nBecause that notice was Ted Kennedy his whole career in life it was one great warning sign with flashing sirens the human rights and freedom from abused don't matter if you vote the right way\nBut perhaps we just thought it was a Kennedy on American royalty of sorts exception [noise] we didn't think it would flow downward to Arkansas we were wrong\nAnd that leaves us with the lesson from ... which is that the Democrats will not just go for the illogical distortions and attacks to stop a conservative\nThey will destroy that conservative and his family personally that's the Kavanaugh provide so to the ... and they will engage in the politics of personal destruction to a level of unforeseen\nTo a level on before seat and they will Dobson gauge in a personal destruction of politics where no norms are common sense can be counted on whatsoever [noise] if we don't take that lesson to heart we have learned nothing beyond notice if you're a conservative\nYour game for attack either in a restaurant\nOr at a fair or at a movie theater or on an airplane\nWith her without your family and your children and if they can't find you and those physicality to physically harass you they will slime and sludge and ruin your name\nThrough the mud and they will ... you and your reputation and does something you not only didn't recognize but didn't think could be done in the United states of America\nThey will take your fifty years of an impeccable life and turn you into the son of Sam are Jeffrey Dahmer or worse\nAnd they will scream and march in March and scream and do anything it takes to create a false narrative that sticks\nWe don't know how to fight that do we all yeah maybe we do if we love this country it must mean we love our countrymen our fellow citizens as well and if we love both we have to make it count\nAnd we get that chance an alternating November's\nSo I was hoping this November the independents and those on fences and those who don't pay attention to politics until roughly November first or October eighth they would be shown on the left does and never want to empower them again\n\nThey would want to deprive them of as much power as they already may have\nI give you after all Jim guarantee the protesters constantly interrupting the hearing at the Senate Judiciary committee did not work\nGoing over Kavanaugh's high school yearbooks as if they were something from the da Vinci code and trying to ascribe some sinister meanings to teenage slang such as booth in devil's triangle did not work\nTrying to make Kavanaugh some like little ... car skeet blue ... university did not work suggesting that Kavanaugh some sort of threat to girls on basketball teams did not work\nPortraying his daughter praying for forgiveness for her father and an editorial cartoon did not work the ... the Arab broad bipartisan\nConsensus for Supreme Court nominees ended with John Roberts Samuel Alito\nSenate Democrat wants to vote against the nominee like Kavanaugh because they don't like his packs decisions or they think he won't uphold roe versus Wade where they don't like that he worked in George Bush's administration that's fine\nBut when Christine Blasey Ford came forward with her accusation the Senate Judiciary committee could have and should have handled that information discreetly and privately without leaking Ford's named to the press\nCommittee staff and investigators could've interviewed fraud in California as well as any other relevant witnesses anywhere else in the country\nThere was no reason to turn forwards life upside down other than that someone with access to her information want her to force on camera\nTestimony let's observe that if any of the witnesses Ford named had corroborated any part of her account any part of it this nomination fight probably would've ended differently\nPJ Smith or even Kaiser had said I remember the party I remember them being upstairs but I don't know what happened in the room or after they turn up the music I couldn't hear what was happening a lot of Republicans would have paused and found the allegations more credible\nThe scene for described teenagers drinking no parents are responsible adults around certainly sounded plausible enough but Ford's account needed corroboration and witnesses and no one she named could do that\nThey couldn't even tell you the party happened never mind an assault\nThe accusation at Yale also sounded plausible enough college freshmen drinking heavily games in pranks getting way out of hand but they couldn't find anyone besides the accuser who claimed Kavanaugh was even at the party\nThe shoddy journalism ... New Yorker breathless Lee touting the accusation and admitting deep in the store that they couldn't find a single person to corroborate that Kavanaugh was at the party well that did not work\nAnd the Democratic party could do itself a huge favor by disassociated himself from Michael ... forever first two accusers at least described plausible scenarios Julie sweating it described Maryland high schoolers\nRunning something that sounds like it would come out of the time of ... or Niro or eyes wide shut with dozens of victims and witnesses and no one ever talking telling a single parent\nCourage would have been standing up in that mob and it was a mob and challenging it courage would have been shaming the shameless courage would have been\nNot going along with the mob\nCourage would have been saying politics are important but the destruction of a human being and his family and his reputation are important too and there are lines we shall not cross as decent people and as human beings that would have been courageous\nIt takes no courage to do with the twenty something no nothing's and their adult\nEnablers did for raw political power there was no courage in any of that you know what was courageous I'll tell you what was courageous Brett Kavanaugh exposing his whole life and his whole world to the whole world the way he did\nTo Thursdays ago that was courageous courage was not backing down to the mob courage was standing up to the mob with every emotion you felt and burying it raw to the whole world that was courageous\nHow many people would have the courage to do what he did\nHow many people would be able to stand up to a mob like that and how many people would be able to defend their reputation when they knew it was intact the way he did that\nWas courage do we even know what it is anymore I don't know I worry about that I worry about in the war on men\nThat were going to alert lose these marshals virtues like courage and perseverance things to forge the future I worry about that a lot when we talk about the crisis with men when we talk about the war on men when we talk about those things were not doing it in a vacuum here\nOf course of course we're more than proud\nTo see women succeed so much and so well in society long overdue long time coming great wonderful should go without saying really should go without passing\nBut there is now a crisis with boys in a crisis with men and it's coming with a political and from a political angle\nAnd it's going to have a bad consequence it's going to have a really bad consequences not only for this country but for those of us that actually cherish human rights and the whole point and value of person heard and human rights\nIt's ... it's going to have a bad consequences in the rest of the world as well and the rest of the world that has not been touched by ... where we are trying to teach if only by example\n[noise] what it means to just be a decent human being\nAnd it's going to have a bad consequences as we go into the holiday season not Halloween per se so much although I shudder to think of some of the costumes are going to be given the past month but at Thanksgiving and
