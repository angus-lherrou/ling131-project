how much of your money is currently in the market\nAll of it half of it\nDid you make a conscious decision to have that particular percentage exposed to market risk or did it just sort of happened why am I asking because I said before the markets go up and the markets go down\nHow much of your life savings that exposed to market risk\nIs a very important consideration for you that's why I strongly encourage everyone to think about their money in terms of bread money then Greene money those terms may sound funny but I Believe they can help us understand a very important concept but let me explain why\nRead money is money that we're willing to expose to market risk in hopes of a higher return with red money we accept the possibility of losses even significant losses in hopes of greater gains\nRed money is always exposed to the upside and downside of market risk\nGreen money on the other hand there's about safety and security was green money were not willing to accept the risk of losses so this money typically we're willing to accept a lower return that exchange for safety and security\nGreen money does not have downsides market risk so Fred money's exposed upside and downside market risk\nAngry money has only upside market potential which ones better well that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad\nIt all depends on your situation\nThe very important question we should ask ourselves or these what percentage of my money should be read money and what percentage of my money should be angry and money if you're at or near

professional\nObviously by calling us now you're just taking the first step towards protecting retirement\nWhich is actually down seven point five percent over this time last year a listing under contract we had eight thousand six hundred and five which is also down eight point nine percent over last year\nAnd then monthly median sales price for all of the Phoenix metro area is two hundred and sixty thousand which is actually up seven point four percent so\nThe media monthly sales price to sixty last year it was a seven point four percent lower than it is this year that means we're appreciating at seven point four percent and\nPrices are not there we don't have a runway price now and we like to use those prices I mean you send the rain to thrive so we might even for the Senate very sustainable\nUm appreciation radio um you know we talked about this in the ... ten percent if you can keep it between five and ten percent um that's sustainable that's a you know that's not a bad thing when you start getting about ten percent get a little hot and get a little bit before below five percent and you're starting to see\nYou know a slowdown in the market but at seven point four percent that is sustainable you know you gotta\nTake everything for you know what it's worth it's when you when you if you're listening or reading stuff about real estate and they're talking about how the prices have gone up in prices and oh my God the affordability factor mhm you know it really isn't that bad our average sales price is to sixty ... day\nAnything under three hundred thousand dollars is moving I mean it goes on the market at like ... I mean you have you done anything under two hundred thousand it's\nI I had a client who is today a town home in Mason cells prices I think one Seventy or one eighty something like that\nI literally put on the market in the morning she had a an accepted offer in the afternoon but that was one of many offers in the course of just a few hours of the day so I you know what ... what we need is we need to see more homes on the market and the three hundred thousand dollar or less\nTo help stem the tide with some of the more people are calling runway prices 'cause they're not seven forty four percent is not a bad appreciation rate\nThat when we look back I think form said it had anticipated a twenty five percent increase over the next three years in Arizona that production was made at the beginning of two thousand Eighteen we may be a little shy of that but it 'cause I think we were all just like oh my gosh that's great for just sitting around twenty five ... increased by ... you know we're we're\nKind of pointless I could do all day and all day long and it's not bad for the people who work in the industry and somebody like myself who's been doing it since ever mhm I'm a seven forty four percent as if we can do that every you know you were between let's say five and seven or eight percent of them are in our I'd be happy well take is for sure\nClose sales for a through October seventh two thousand Eighteen so I guess this is actually told closed a monthly sales I should say seven thousand five hundred and forty for that is actually up eight percent over last year which is great\nAh let's go or are lifting six listing success rate of the listings that came off the active work pending status eighty point nine percent successfully closed escrow while Nineteen point one percent are cancelled or expired\nA and then lastly are we always talk about this month's of supply or if there were no a new listings to come on the market or at the current monthly rate of sales\nAre inventory would run out and just to point seven months so and we talked about that sweet sweet spot would be about four or five months but [noise] you know where to point seven\nMinutes it slow but it actually I Believe is up I think last month when the crop for came out where a two point five or two point six months ago and I know that doesn't do much but every percentage point we can go up next month or a two point eight or two point nine how it's going to make me happy yeah I'm ... and\nWe always tell our listeners to keep everything in perspective because if you look at something like Denver that has less than a one month supply\nOr you know it this is great case you know but it's all perspective\nI mean I think about it if all of a sudden which never happened but of all of a sudden nobody wanted to sell their home and to point seven months they were literally be new homes ... that means before Christmas no excuse me before the end of the year\nWe would have no real estate to sell that I mean you think about that it's like wow that's not too far off and this is why we need people to sell this is why we need builders to build and we're going to talk about some of the builder permits that have been coming out because we're seeing a nice increase\nUm you know when the builders build you know that that's adding inventory to the market gives our buyers another option because there was tons of buyers during the spring that were just shut out there are shut up because multiple contract situations you know they had nothing to buy and they eventually in some cases just decided to re up another twelve months on their rent you know\nUh you know in the house they're renting so that took them out of the market for a while so with these builders building that's going to\nUh you know what we're what we're doing is we're stocking the shelves were stocking shelves for the spring buying season which is really really nice so we're gonna see regular residential resell if things go up we're going to see I think in an increase in that image tore and with the builders building giving in our buyers another option and allowing our sellers and this is what's going to help ourselves too because\nIf there are builders out there some of these people going who that subdivision just open up down the street those that's where we've been waiting for boom now all of a sudden there's at residential re sell this thing that can hand the markets so basically what the builders are doing and what we really need the the regular resell owners to do is to stock the shelves for the coming months and get that inventory I\nWell I tell you speaking of builders that's a great segue we did actually just also get the two thousand eight teams single family building permits\nAh for each jurisdiction a kind of some interesting numbers on here ah let's go down if you want to go right down the line but let's look at some of the the more notable once Castro grand a she's a Buckeye has a total of one thousand six hundred and eighty five building permits for two thousand and a Eighteen year to date\nA which is a pretty pretty notable ... percent have three percent actually yeah some of the other ones that have larger increases I'm ... I'm Sorry I'm I'm kinda scanning through\nAll that you were younger and let's bring that they're literally doubling the size of the city by building Ninety One home exactly and I wouldn't be for sale you have Ninety One ... year to date on Apache junction and and you know for those that have lived here for a long time you know a ... junction just\nBeen a kind of that town at the end of the other side of me out there as soon as you drive towards globe and ... and or you make a right to go down to Florida but they did Ninety One proves their up a hundred and thirty three percent\nWell over being up a hundred percent about Coolidge Coolidge had last year they did to building permits\nAnd they got for this ... doubling the size level and the other side of the ... ah\nUm you know is a lot of cities you know queen creek is up forty seven percent eighty four percent my home town and surprise risk now than fifty four year today\nPermits when that's up eighty four percent over last year you you're going to see this a lot in a lot of your outlying areas even though I mean uh Glendale has got a hundred and fifty permits or up twenty percent you know going oh\nNot completely landlocked but you know I mean there's not a whole ton of uh of space however ride along Glendale avenue as you're going on the other side of the one on one is you're going to just lurk air force base there's a brand new subdivisions going in just before you get to the base and just to the left side was uh just\nNewly completed subdivision so there's a lot going on around the air force base\nWell and and then you'd be able to hottest markets are usually lower Chandler in Scottsdale right you look at Chandler they're actually down thirty one percent for ... for building permits they did three hundred and thirty six this year four hundred and eighty seven last year\nAnd again same thing that they're they're dumb thirty one percent in Chandler [noise] uh and I still is also down about twelve percent\nUh with three hundred and sixteen building permits obviously not a ton of room to build stole Scottsdale is you're doing ... stuff but\nThe other well even even Phoenix proper finger proper two thousand eight hundred and fifty for building permits and this is residential building permits this isn't commercial or anything there are thirty one percent I mean how much bigger can mean Phoenix get I mean a lot of people think oh my God you know the all all the growth is going to go to the outlying areas but there's a whole lot in North Phoenix\nOr for water is being adopted there where they can still grow 'em you do have a ... ton of ... a ton of ... and a ton of you know I had an inner city of Phoenix projects going on for multifamily I'm a residential not multifamily like rentals but ah you know where they're doing town home come\nOut of the millennial type ... movie a lot of that well a lot of last being built out and stuff so\nThere's there's a whole lot going on ... don't want yards as we get bigger as as a city no they don't want yard and I was already went a little grass ... go and then they get up and they put it in a bag and they take it yet I don't understand and it's probably their small I bet they putting their person and you know it's you know just even in the in the area around in the in the stores and and all that\nThat's an Sun City they do that all the everybody carries her dogs around with it so that's that's what's going on as far as ... or ... residential building is concerned where the guy wanted to bring in you know I've I've often said this that\nBuying or selling a home is the second most stressful thing you ever do and you're like short number one is getting married but they did a study and buying home is actually more stressful then planning the wedding believer okay yeah yep um\nThey did a study sixty seven sixty two percent of everybody that uh they surveyed since that that buying a home is more stressful than planning the wedding you might not have been more stressed woman actually getting married which downright frightening for most everybody\nUm and they would you know a lot of them say a lot of people say this to well never do it again that's just one time you know in ... the divorce rates are I'm sure people say the same thing about buying and selling a home to you know how many times I've had people say that none of four or five years later they're back in my office sign a document to\nYou know but it it is a very stressful thing and what you know the best thing about it is the the guest that we have on the show the lender guess the the age and guess\nPartnering with really good people in our industry help can alleviate a lot of that\nYou would have taxes insurance anyway if you had the property free and clear or even if you had a a mortgage on it you'll be paying your taxes insurance anyway so it's not something that's like oh wow now I have to do that you were doing that all along we were doing it anyway so so okay so if you had a mortgage on the property you would treat this just like a regular refinance\nYou would um pay off the existing financing now new financing goes in\nRight and the payment on that existing financing goes away correct and the new mortgages in place you can choose to take that one big lump sum mhm you or you could do monthly payments\nUm or is there any ... or you sort of equity incredible ... line of credit K. so you might only want to take it let's say you had three hundred thousand dollars let's use the four hundred and one hundred type situation you've paid off for a hundred you got three hundred thousand dollars left over to you you could say I want fifty right now right so he will do something with it but you still have another two fifty leftovers that you could go tap right\nNote so here's the thing it's based on age and equity so that it's exactly the opposite of a thirty year mortgage right so every month you're making a payment your principal balance goes down on a reverse mortgage\nYou're not making a monthly mortgage payment so your principal balances going up absolutely yes right so you can't get the full value of your house right the way of ha and how to have it set up its kind of like actuarial schedule right there looking at when you're gonna die right because the last thing they want is your house is going to cost them to\nCome in take it over salad do anything like that so they want to make sure that when the last individual in the home passes away that there's equity and so there's a calculator that I plugged in numbers and it literally takes me thirty seconds to tell somebody what it's what it's called ... yeah so\nIf somebody Ninety five came to they look at a calculator and they got a whole lot of time left I mean so they all they factor all that is\nSo they're going to get more money the older you are okay right the the younger you are the less likely you're gonna you're gonna be able to get less money you're going to be able to get if you refinance the more money you would have to put down the older you are because obviously sticking a a a the the less you would have to bring in with the more you could get out\nOf an interesting see I I've talked to a lot of reverse mortgages with a lot of lenders over the years and I've never known about that part of it that's that's very interesting\nWe're going to take a break and second 'cause I Want to talk about how in it's not just used for refinancing or you know in homes you already have\nYou can actually use the ... or slash reverse mortgage loan to actually purchase real estate and I also want to talk about how you know you can actually use this as part of your financial planning which I think you're phenomenal because there's a lot of people out there going you know how can I have\nAnother source of income and how can maximize that cash because what I'm thinking that you're doing is you're going to take their money out and then you're going to invest it somewhere that can make more money for you is kind of what I'm what I'm thinking we're going to go with that\nI'm not so much I call it more of a lot of time or or some planning and I can talk a little bit about that as well\nYeah yeah yeah definitely when we get back I Want you there there it also can increase your buying power of gun right I mean you can buy a little bit more ... and we can talk a little bit about that if you can double ... yeah absolutely and uh I actually had a of a financial consultant come in one of my classes and showing everyone ... a\n... ... mortgage will increase their their retirement savings by nine years to to Eighteen years depending on how you do it so there's a lot of good uses one\nSo you got to be sixty two is there any type of psycho score requirements or anything like that\nI Know it it's really a light underwrite anymore I'm OK it's there's just there's no monthly mortgage payment you're not really looking at the income and the creditors\nAs hard so it's not as stringent as far as all the paperwork and all the other stuff that the normal buyer or for far we'll have to sort of\nWe're still gonna want the paperwork but it's not as have even under I think that John Atkins with no hormones we're gonna take a break we'll be back after this [noise]\n[noise]\nHey guys this is Phil and Josh Rogosin

talking to John actually you know the hormones and we're discussing the the heck I'm Alone which is the home equity conversion mortgage which used to be known as a reverse mortgage and in the first thing that we talked about how it can be used for let's say to refinance purposes but it's not\nJust for that you can actually use these heck I'm loans for purchase correct\nAbsolutely yeah it's becoming a more and more mainstream it's Alvin increase cash flow um is helping increase a savings for retirees that they don't have to put down the house to eliminate the mortgage payment\nUh well let's talk a little bit about what we talk during the break about the buyer from Chicago and ... and the potential of having some increased buying power with a heck of a mortgage give us some examples\nSo uh I give this one all the time so you get somebody in Chicago who's you know retiring retired\nThey sold their house that was a few years ago where three fifty four hundred thousand titles said they sold it for three hundred thousand now okay so they're like well you know I took a hit on that and they move out here\nAnd they start looking for properties and the two to twenty five you vividly arranged you know like well that's not what I Lived in Chicago yeah yeah so what do you do right they don't want a mortgage\nThey don't want you know they don't want to use all their money on it settled a reverse mortgage comes in you can basically but you know forty fifty sixty percent depending on their age down ... going to double the buying power so they could go by four hundred thousand dollar home ... um put two hundred thousand dollars down and not have a monthly mortgage payment yeah\nAnd still have a hundred grand in the bank from their equity that's what we are\nAnd and also have an instant equity position in the home because of the down payment which now here's one of the myth that I Want to get rid of right now\nWhen an individual who has one of these loans dies the bank doesn't automatic get the property or gay\nNow there were some really bad reverse mortgages way back when the day and in the terms of those reverse mortgages there may have been something in there that said that when somebody dies the bank automatically get that but the under Arizona State foreclosure laws you can't circumvent the foreclosure\nBecause I don't know areas built in the fifties early fifties and sixties yeah and then the rest of our Kenny kind of just kind of morphed around it like into the sixties and then boom it was done you know and\nThis past year we split some lots on Lafayette and it was very successful it's people lived there for over forty years and\nAh took that fifty three thousand square foot lot and turned it into two big lots of rules for a million eight Seventy well while a crime in a nice builder to hawks are give them a little plug sure there are a builder in the area\nUm they're putting up to brand new uh ... on that a lot and it's it's pretty a typical of Arcadia proper to keep putting up ... and also the other surrounding areas are both Arcadia light and lower\nHave an abundance of ... going in as well but the lies are a little bit smaller generally in size and of course a lot less money to purchase\nNow if somebody's building and I and I probably know the answer to this question but of some of the building is back home in Arcadia or any of the lighter proper or\nLower the houses that do they sit long\nNo [laughter] ... long at all in fact they sell pretty quick for you know so it's two and a half to three point two million dollar home\nJournal way it's taking about Seventy days if not sooner is one of those one of those pretty fast they for that price range of absolute and I'm In Arcadia lower and Arcadia lied generally it's going to take about\n... sixty days or hops that strategy quick for that minority and the you know basically run a million bucks for a brand new home and that may have those\nTwo neighbor that that does marketers crazy 'cause I have some Asian so we do luxury up in Scottsdale and it's not uncommon to have seven hundred thousand days on market for some of the stuff that you know it all the trend is what it is people want\nNew they want the collar colorized correctly they're looking for you know to come into their light bright and open very open homes and have that\nReally beautiful home are all fully updated right now a lot of the home's north Scott still need a lot of work because there are a lot of them were done in the Tuscan yes and that's not good any more than ... an Eighteen years up there in North Scottsdale plenty of 'em all the way through those or mountain\nOr something so at least you know Andrew is known for his Arcadia stuff and all that you bring a different dynamic to the group we talked off the air that you work a lot with your work all over the valley but you work a lot with investors which leads you to are all over the valley correct\nThat's correct I I started in Tempe and I started because I live there at that time Twenty years ago and I started with investors and when the market started to go out the inventory was so low I had to branch out which\nWhich enabled me to learn the rest of the valley and bring my investors to just look at ... numbers what's going to work and so I learned about\nCentral Phoenix and all the outskirts and it's it's been a great learning experience because I've kept those investors and now I'm able to continue branching out\nAnd look at different areas known and not just a one price point but all different price might cause my investors ranged from that condos all the way up to\nThem multimillion dollar investments they want to tear down in the areas that Andrew had specialized in ... and they'll new so I've been able to bring them that aspect especially teeming with him\nSure sure and working with investors I mean it's\nYou know ... ... like they say my real estate or by land they're not making any more of it you know what I mean so there's plenty of investors to go around it's just a matter of finding those Wright properties that fit you know what they're looking for you know there's some investors that\nLike I Want to invest in real estate but they're not working with somebody like yourself who works with investors and they end up buying something like okay that was not a good fit and they ended up not making the kind of return they want to make or it's just not about you know it's not good investment\nYou use a ... and working with your investors you use something called he not forecasting\nYeah it's uh it's pretty interesting it's actually available\nAt ... that a lot of them are not familiar with it and it shows at twelve months forecast of what the sales have been and what the increase has banned the appreciation and it also shows do the heat nap and the colors\nShelling which areas has been\nGoing up what are in the track to dial up so and investors can look at their property if they currently online\nAnd look at that it's appreciate it twenty percent and say you know this is a good time to sell let's go over to this area over here how can I be a different part of the valley and let's reinvest do at ten thirty one exchange does mean be\nAnd reinvest because this is only at ten percent and it still poised to go up mhm\nBecause there's a lot of areas that are just prime for investors but the industry is just haven't gone in there and drove to help drive that mark it up and so by seeing that they can help forecasts aren't going you know what yes that this area is kind of hit its peak let's look over here which is nice you know so it gives somebody it's you know it's kind of like give him that crystal ball\nIt is and the other thing that I've noticed with people that live in the valley they tend to think that what they knew ten years ago about an area it's still the same and they really haven't looked at it and because of the appreciation and all of that update\n... I've been working in this industry for thirty five years and yes I that is probably my you know the the thing that I when I talk to people and they say well this is how it once they start with this is how we did or this the way we did it or whatever\nI almost want to just cut them off and go ... because whatever you're going to say is going to be wrong I'm Sorry because this is an ever moving fluid changing market in the valley is not what it was Thirty years ago or even ten years ago ten years ago it was two thousand eight that was the peak of that was the the top of the real estate a\nA a market and then the crash happened right after that so here we are ten years later so you can't even go back ten years or even Twenty years and then the thing that you're dealing with with some of these investors have been invested in a while so they need to be re educated but then you have some of the sellers who lived in these homes for twenty or Thirty years\nAnd they literally have to be sat down and re educated them look this is the way it is now in this market don't even think about what you did before and having a talk with them and doctors are having that need that talk or some sellers that need that talk it's kinda tough sometimes but\nYou know when you're able to show them proof positive by seeing this heat not forecasting and say look here's what's happening and some people might go are you kidding this area is doing this\nIsn't perfect because it shows proof\nThat people are buying and selling and investors and and you know with this area's hot where you know maybe Twenty years ago that person when you go I can never believe that that area is doing what it's doing now\nCorrect at least I got a question for you yeah I Know that you had your own you were you were you had your own brokered your shoulder before why why did you join the Andrew wheeler electric ...\n... what what made it so what they've tried to them when you put you on the spot here with Andrew sit right next to just got a curious why what ... what what made you joined what what are the aspects that you learned about it\nA couple of different reasons one with timing definitely I'd been solo my entire career which I said started about Twenty years ago and\nIn this day and age of real estate you really need the support and the dynamics of having a lecture read and investment and\n... having a team that you get along with that that supportive and Andrew is really dynamic when it comes to\nThe uh the uh\nTechnical side and when I can do the\nAnalysis this man knows what he's doing that and it is awesome and it's great for investors and just a regular traditional homebuyer or seller cool cool\nWell Andrew we talked a little bit and you you mentioned to me is that your we need more sellers\nWe need more subtle is about the arrowhead my salary are uh you know our market is really short on him and tour and there's plenty of buyers out there with the ... people coming in from out of state right now we need a place to put them\nAnd I don't think it's a ... a better time than now to get your home listed in the market if you're thinking of making\nA move up or move sideways or change out of state or a change in state whatever your\nMotivation is for ... for wanting to maybe so today it's a great time to sell and and I would I Would encourage to go ahead and get your home lifted up and get it soul because now is a time where you know you can get top dollar mhm well I don't have a crystal ball for next week\nYeah yeah and but we're also starting to see a small shift towards buyers so it's a facility wants to get top dollar for their home in any that now I Would absolutely\nAct now because you know going into this new burner new season the the the bars are pouring into town we've got all these out of town are starting are snowbirds season kicked off now and then with California what I've heard recently about San Francisco on loading forty six percent yup that's more than six percent\nOf people wanting to leave northern California for whatever reason they're choosing to do so I specifically um advertising in the bay area in northern California to attract new customers wanting to buy homes here in the valley\nHalf the U.S because we do in surprise are from Southern California people from Southern California moving over here because they can get way more for their home and they're able to get jobs that pay\nI I had one guy that he was able to transfer companies and he kept his California salary and moved a surprise I mean yeah it's crazy we're seeing a huge influx from not just Southern California but you're right in northern California and they want out of the congestion shirt and you know you become much more you can get for your money that they love it here a day I'm easily love it here you guys have some lifting\n\nI'm On my friends' time [noise] I watch\nActually I listen to Nikki Haley's conference with the president [noise] where it\nWas announced that she was leaving the United nations at the end of the year she had already told the president this [noise]\nPrior to the I don't know when did it was it made clear several months ago Romney so there's speculation as to why is she leaving because of course nothing could actually happen for orderly innocuous reasons\nSeems to me that two years in the United nations or one should be up for a monument\nSomewhere in the capital especially if you've confronted the bad guys of the world is Nikki Haley has and I was not done by during the eight years abroad Obama\nAnd keeping true to\nA major left wing\nAttitude toward life you\nWhen you don't fight this is an ancient to tell muted craze those who are crucial to the kind of ... better for those who were coming to the crew will be cruel to the kind\n\nThat is a motto of our dear fellow citizens of the left liberals but on the left and that is that they are\nKind to the cruel like the Iranian regime and they are cruel to the kind like Israel\nThat's a perfect pitch truly a perfect example there was something truly sick\nThere's a there's a morality of the conscience for those who work kinder to Iran than to Israel\nOr to Hezbollah or Hamas or to all of them Nikki Haley has been extraordinary if the United nations Donald Trump has been extraordinary at the United nations\nAfter all the United nations ambassador\nReflect the will of the president of the United states\nI repeat that the risk of what\nIs the risk but I think of it what is the risk my sings at bus far the president of the United states has been a great president\n... well the risk is\nThat you alienate those who hate the president but I have a model with regard to that I adopted this when I ... in my first full time job\nAnd I was the director of a Jewish Institute in California that's why I moved from New York to California in my twenties to direct this Institute they had weekend retreats was gorgeous facility thirty two hundred acres\nThey had this summer sessions for young people and I would advocate God's existence and I would advocate\nObservance of the laws in the Bible and so on and some members of the board or very afraid of my advocacy of God's existence an observance of the laws of the Bible\nAnd so on and they uh they would say to me you know not not with hatred or anything like that are just they would be worried and they would say you know you'll alienate some of the people who come and I developed a great phrase that has guided me you can't alienate the alienated\nThey already worry alienated [laughter]\nThat's why they showed up [laughter] somebody you know a friend begged them to cover somebody treated they do a weekend or whatever\nSo you know I'll alienate people by saying that the president of the United states has been great bus far I don't think that those people have already been alienated I guess that's all it takes is is a favorable word of a mirror vote for Republican\nAnd you're pro rape you understand how ... does become there are no limits to what the left will say that there are no moral limits to what they will do or say\nWho is this person who tweeted out that the take a hit you know do something for the good guys and that somebody should take out Brett Kavanaugh\nTeacher it was a teacher with\nA special ed teacher in Minnesota and and so this is one cracks me up a ... so was this on a Facebook account or a tweet so Twitter has decided to suspend this person's account suspend\nYou of publicly called for murder\nAnd your your account is suspended didn't they suspend James Woods who called for no no violence whatsoever\nWho's barely a well by the way he is truly one of the ...\nPeople in the country\nI I don't read many tweets but I read I read his my wife sure the ... to me\nIt's a it's an extraordinary thing\nSo anyway ah he has been great it is an astonishing thing I Do worry I admit it or would like to let me can I play ball Street Journal here yeah I I admit it\nI'm just saying I worry what do you think that because I support the president I have a bans in critical fault and I may be wrong by the way I was just telling you what I'm worried I'm not telling you I oppose what he's doing\nBut I Am worried U.S China strains deep and and I there was only one reason one that I Am worried about us China relations you know what it might be\nI don't think the Chinese would invade Taiwan metal to Taiwan so good because North Korea\nI think that if China says to Kim Jong un don't continue the nuclear ... of them he won't\nTeach too reliant on China I stretched China's way of holding us hostage is is North Korea there is no no no other\nSo that's the reason I worry abut that China has\nAbuse the world Trade Organization that end is abused intellectual property\nIt's I I personally a worry more about China than about Russia\nOr for a whole host of reasons I and I think the Chinese nationalism is growing at ... China I Know a fair amount about China because of my involvement with the Chinese people\nAnd ... people don't know how corrupt China is that corruption is a way of life in China\n\nFrom inside I Know for example people often pay for pay for judges they normally pay the judge they pay to get the judge and the and kept the verdict that they want it's a it's a truly\nIn many ways I mean not all Chinese I'm Chinese come to the United states for example they become spectacularly successful\nA surgeon [laughter] is what it was such an example of who I consider somewhat of a genius\nAnd my by recent uh injury of my eye which by the way is getting better and better thanks to the treatment that may have been receiving the chief the person involved in my I work including laser surgery is also the parents are Chinese\nYou don't have to show me on the capabilities of Chinese people but ...\nIs devoid of values because of many reasons the biggest of course being the\nCommunism communism rapes a country of its values it empties benefiting rapes it empties a country of its values\n\nNothing there's nothing left after communism it leaves a gigantic cold now Christians are filling it somewhat but the persecution of Christians in China has increased all of this is to tell you\nThat it is totally understandable that at some point someone so president interested in America is going to have to confront China better sooner than later however I worry because of\nNorth Korea that's that's the issue\nThat was apropos of what\nDid they say they are we right so that's why I didn't understand ... speaking who's speaking about\nIf it's we\nKnow so I don't know that's the point that's the reason I didn't quite follow All right\nBut he lives with me this is the cover story taking up a good chunk of USA Today today one aide Prager seven seven six is the number\nAnd let's see or hear those read in Minneapolis, Minnesota hello\nI watch to the press conference president had with Nikki Haley about her resigning and I I thought it was a very positive uplifting informative yes at almost immediately Senator Bob Menendez a Democrat New Jersey\nA wrote today's announcement that bass or aliens resigning if you had another sign of the Trump administration's chaotic foreign policy and he went on to say deeply concerned about the leadership vacuum a cheerleading\n... Noda after the children to read that the the left has always deeply concerned they live in a state of deep concern\nI just do you use that word so why does he he's deeply concerned that why I was talking over you at the end\nI was just wondering if he was watching the same press conferences I\nOh I see yeah\n[laughter] that I thought it was a very uplifting effect faced they both look very pleasant happy they have ... I was expecting something maybe a little ... but I thought oh this was a you know she's moving on that she's done a great job and\nShe is a big fan of the president wants to continue to stay in touch with them and work for him and the country will support him if he\n... her reelection would be a her would be secretary of state\nMike Pompeo decides to will leave in the next two years I Would see McCain Haley I Want you to know thank you read I Want you to know my friends that if the Democrats win the house we will have two years of just criminal investigations\nBut the the further destruction of our society by the left will continue what pace using the government as a as an apparatus of oppression that is what they believe in everything will be criminalized everything\nThe president will just be under investigation and the left will will will totally\nA well commit\nThat this is this is what will happen and any at all means are ...\nAre valid that they don't understand that might come
