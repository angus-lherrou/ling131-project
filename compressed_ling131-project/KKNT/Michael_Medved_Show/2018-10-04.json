Democrats making wild accusations trying to a\nPractice the politics of personal destruction trying for a massive and comprehensive investigations of what the terms booth singing devil's triangle really meant to high school students in Nineteen eighty two if you believe this is the\nKind of an endeavor in which our representatives in Congress should be engaged in most of the Democrats\nAnd 'cause you'll be getting lots and lots and lots more of this and if they win this thing drawing of the reasons that I think that Republicans have been so unified and so energized by this whole process\nIs because there's an understanding and people right now they're not attacking Donald Trump that Donald Trump I mean he attacks back and he says things sometimes that are stupid says things sometimes that are not true but that is not Brett Kavanaugh for goodness sake\nBrett Kavanaugh's entire record is one of mainstream conservatism of judicial excellence of support from\nPeople who don't agree with them building coalitions and that's exactly why they're afraid of him on the Supreme Court\n\nJudge Kavanaugh I have a good relationship with Elena Kagan an Obama appointee associate justice of the spring court how do we know because she says so she was the one when she was dean of Harvard law school who pointed Brett Kavanaugh to change their and if they are\nGoing to go after Brett Kavanaugh who does build coalitions who works with other people who has a life long record of impressing people positively men and women and black and white and liberal and conservative if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh and make him into some kind of cartoon villain\nMake him into some kind of serial rapist stumbling drunk I mean none of this is true\nAnd it's the worst kind of politics it's despicable politics and people talk about a threat to democracy this kind of politics is more of a threat to democracy than all of President Trump's stupid tweets combine than there are plenty of stupid tweets\nAnd the idea that I'm President Trump is going to permanently alienate\nFemale voters it's it's not true President Trump in the last election won a majority of white female voters truly didn't win as big majorities Romney did\nBut he won a majority and the the idea that that the Democrats are trying polarization to separate eight women out and say ... women have to vote like well then see how that worked for Hillary Clinton\n... it and the answer is it didn't and I believe that this democratic strategy is divisive\nAnd awful\nAnd ah that the American people are waking up to its dangers and to um to to try to to stop at the here's a disagreeing email that came in from Brian in Compton, California\nAh his message to me is judge ... guilty where there is smoke there's fire he Republicans whitewash everything\nIt's clear as a twenty year investigator for the state which include sexual assault cases right of center I interviewed over thirty plus pick another candidate Andrew BS comment about his demeanor court versus private that's ridiculous my comment\nPassionate about and that law conservative\nOkay let me I Will I Will answer that in a moment but I Want to let you finish you had another disagreement and I will answer your question very directly coming right out but go ahead what's your other disagreement Tammy\nThis agreement with a few weeks ago you were talking about [noise] uh I I think I don't know what it was a young black man it said he felt unsafe and I'm a white neighborhood\nThat does make you madness oh I couldn't make that statement but and you try to convince you say not true and I'm sure but you don't know how this young men feel in a quiet neighborhood ... why why do you feel unsafe every white neighborhood is not safe\nThat's absolutely true you're right I Am but a what he was saying is that he feel unsafe in any white neighborhood not just that he feels unsafe and a specific white neighborhood which can be crime ridden the point that I was making was that\nA you know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but\nNearly all of that crime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth or in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth but I think the absence\nOf any confirming evidence at all is overwhelming\nAnd the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd ... and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context and the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is he really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know him I've never met him\nBut I Do know people who've worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are only a left\nUm al ... who is a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with a a judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and the notion\nThat he should be blocked from the Supreme Court based on auto early unsupported unprecedented accusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that\nYou know about people who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and and uh at end violence against women\nMost of those people do it as a pattern is not a one off and\nThe idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a doctor for it are completely non credible and have been clearly denied a vet I think is worth taking into consideration of coming up\nVery prominent Republican speaks to\nA group of protesters them going to be women\nAnd he urges those women to

Michael thank you for allowing us to be on the show um my journey to Atlanta really started when I was five year old kid in St court growing up in poverty and sorcery court firefighters putting out a far\nA cough alley from wherever you live and um when I saw those firefighters that day I uh looked at my\nBig brothers and my mom and a little sisters and said I Want to be a fireman when I grow up and are stuck with me all my life and I became a firefighter in St port in Nineteen eighty one and a Eighteen years later I became the first African American fire chief in the city of St court records\nExperienced a tremendous amount of discrimination costs about race there early portions of my career but through hard work and faith and determination over came out with those challenges but eight years after becoming fire chief in St port I was blessed to become the fire chief in Atlanta\nOn the thin layer Shirley Franklin and um ten or twenty months after serving her I was appointed to the United states are much traction on to the ministry should a president in Iraq Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta\nAbout it the honorable America shame read in two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this is this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success how how is it you ended up whether you are say you were Terminator ... you\nWere fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a\nA year prior to my termination I published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish for Christian men the book is called\nWho told you that you were ... the question that got ask Adam and the garden and eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcoming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated this was a cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between the house but I don't know why and how they match 'em on it and that any sex outside of that a is a fan and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get this straight you have these opinions what's your opinions and literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow are not at all\nSo it it was the fact is you self published the book he hadn't use public funds what business is it of the city\nOf Atlanta for the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city's views are and that\nI can have those views as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city or I had an obligation to check those beliefs at the door is what one council members and the mayor clearly supported that fish\nOkay at at this point\nAh this I think most people are listening to us or slapping therefore has I think this is just clearly unjust and when people suffer injustice or discrimination\nOr a really an assault against their religious liberties or freedom of conscience who you're going to call not ghost busters you call the alliance defending freedom or David court men attorney for the IDF oh what did the ATF do what did you do are about to achieve conference case\nIt was it was quite remarkable when she first contacted us because we thought like you were saying this can't be true uh this can happen in America someone writes a religious book for for Christian man a Bible study\nAnd on his own time and and don't forget for for for what to happen here people would have had taken received a voluntarily the hundred and sixty two page book take it home\nTake hours or days to read it\nFind one small portion to be offended\nBy in the in the one hundred and sixty two page book go back to work and say hey I was offended by this and then you end up with the chief being fired okay we're going to come to the like everyone else probably lifting thought that was not only unjust but unconstitutional and filed the lawsuit on behalf of the chief and what was incredible the the argument\nIf you can hold on

addresses which no one can remember well driving asked them to do a simple Google Search of contacts Senator Flake it'll get them to the right place on his website here's what I wrote him today\nSenator Flake I'm Sorry for the pressure you are currently under but the issue you are really faced with is whether you're going to let mob rule become the acceptable form of government in the United states while watching the protests today I fear for our country if you don't vote to confirm qualified Supreme Court nominee\nA no vote will reinforce the left to know that emotional outburst overshadow the normal rule of law and our Democratic Republic I'm saddened that a few vocal protestors who have nothing to do is sit around and chat and scream of people in elevators can sway senators like yourself\nWhile hardworking taxpaying Americans who have to stay home and hold town jobs could not get their representatives to follow through on what we really need to get done\nPlease confirm judge Kavanaugh and stop the madness close quote good advice good letter I urge others to go do the same\nIf fault tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of you who listen to this do that\nIt's a great thing for Mr flick to have\nNow long term earlier this week we commence to discussion of getting back to basics\nI told you to about the latest state of our civic literacy\nLess than twenty percent of those under the age of forty five can get sixty percent of the answers right on our citizenship tests repeat that because there were a lot of numbers they're less than twenty percent of those under the age of forty five\nCan get sixty percent of the answers right on our citizenship tested in other words less than twenty percent of those under the age of forty five can pass or US citizenship test you need a sixty percent to pass\nNow you know what I mean when I keep saying I'm happy\nAnd we need to to talk about an address the issues having to do with the illegal immigration and illegal aliens\nWe do it a lot here but we have a huge problem with our own homegrown education system that is making aliens of our own citizens aliens to a country they were born in educated in raised in in a country after all that they still do not know\nThis is a crisis what might a crisis like this look like well it might might look like people not valuing the first amendment the freedom of speech\nOr the import of religious freedom it might look like people cannot respect alternative points of view or the first rule of politics that others may not agree with you\nThere was a reason after all that the federalist papers were written right there were written to persuade and not to persuade those who already agreed with what we were doing with our constitution obviously\nThere was a reason after all we decided to have an election system here\nThough it might look like people cannot understand the point not when it's a foregone conclusion as to who should be heard and whose side should win and then when they don't win\nAnd they don't like the result they can act like so many southern Confederate since say not my president and not my country and engage in all versions and variants of nullification\nIn other words it might look like people actually don't want a democracy or Republican form of government because they do not understand or respect or like the idea that yes actually other people and other viewpoints get a chance to govern from time to time\nThe crisis I speak of might look like we don't care about a hundred year old doctrines when trying to do our legal process sees such as we protect them and the fourth\nAnd fifth and sixth amendments you know innocence until guilt is proven investigations by authorities requiring probable cause another standards of proof attorney client privilege the right to confront ones accuser\nIt might look like all of that and well folks I give you the times it's exactly where we are\nSo we have to go back to fundamentals I thought it might be fun if we all identified five to ten pillars of our society so that we might have some kind of unified field theory of what does keep us a flow what does keep us going\nMichael Moore says in his most recent ... that he misses an America that never was odd location that but when you're dealing fiction sure you can say things like that and\nWhen you deal with military in hopes based on Marxist ideology you bet try and bring it up and down to earth but just remember as these Marxist don't\nWe have as human beings different views of what the having may look like and bus the Marxist when given power always brings hell up to earth and never have been down to it\nSo how about we missed in America that actually was\nThat was based on certain agreed upon pillars pillars like the importance of citizenship pillars like the importance of the rule of law pillars like the respect\nAnd protection of others' opinions be they dissenting opinions or majority ... majorities Harry and opinions pillars like protections from both the tyranny of the majority as much as the tyrannies from the minority pillars like defend their rights as well as victim writes pillars like public safety\nSo I ask you call me with the most important pillars of civilization you think are the most important here\nThat of the cultural or political lessons we would take from I'm Brett Kavanaugh's testimony on Thursday a week ago and the fallout since that\nOne of the things would be those not particularly engaged in politics those who might be somewhat engaged but kind of identified down the middle going into the U.S election season particularly those who you know consider themselves independents not\nAn automatic role for the Republicans\nThat they would for once and for all or at least finally see what the left does when they have the kind of power\nThey wish they had that the that that that the bark is off the tree for the left that this is what the left does and that they will if not never again at least this November not give them a chance to have the power they so crave this is what they do with\nA um I totally agree I mean they're on a TV made the meteor um for all the world history and embarrassment\nAnd that's it I mean seriously anyone even involved with ... or you can go to Peter Lugers and I'm\nOlder lecturing publication that book or the um [noise] oh I could have a um [noise] a\nPrime guy and you're saying all of the ... all the all the empty rolled in\nSecret great um as far as a free will ring circus and\nJust watching today their cellphone footage and on the news it's a joke and people ... current and on the computer that's what would be in Hillary Clinton were to record this is what we have twenty four hours a day non-stop\nOh I agree with you quite and this is why it was always amazing to me David during the election itself that people were so willing to make an issue of Donald Trump's character\nRight though they may have been if character mattered to them but not in comparison in contrast to Hillary Clinton's character um when given a choice between the two\nUm character the arguments for characters out the window it doesn't it doesn't abide here because one could easily make the case that Hillary Clinton's character is far worse than Donald Trump's character or one could make the case then the other direction I'll concede that to some are on some things\nBut in my score character of hers just as bad if not worse than his and I think much worse because I have not seen anything from Donald Trump that tries to actively destroy\nVictims of sexual abuse has has she trying to do\nWhat he's a builder and are destroying other you go ... concern to me today um\nRegarding Rick ... confirmation or ...
