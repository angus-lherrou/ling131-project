I mean is it are the attacks on women or their attacks on his opponents who happened to the women and then there's this in adds some Democrats are being cast as terrorists\nAnd um\nThen they say ... a

there that are saying the Democrats are terrorists\nThey are making a point that this guy a mark ... who's running against Duncan Hunter is a is a terrorist sympathizers or how do we know because he donated money for the cause look I I\n[noise] first of all his grandfather was one of the masterminds of the Munich Olympic massacre it's his grandfather and he he used to praise his\nGrandfather and their stuff on the Internet about him calling his grandfather a legend which he has since deleted and now he apparently converted to Christianity good for him but even since his conversion to Christianity or he is continued to give money to donate money\nTo uh the council on American Islamic Relations\nWhich is not a terrorist organization but it is an organization that justifies and sympathizes with um Muslim extremism I had a brain Hooper on this radio show\nWho is head of the time of the council on American Islamic Relations which congressional candidate donated to\nAnd um I

said it a simple answer is no absolutely not would suffice he wouldn't give that answer\nAnd I pushed and pushed and pushed and then eventually said yes well if we ever get a majority of Muslims in the United states it would be appropriate to uh to have sharia replace the constitution sorry that's an extreme position\nAnd it is worth it is perfectly legitimate for I'm Duncan Hunter and for the

it sound less he he used to be\nHis middle name used to be Yasser and that was changed um [noise] it the entire thing is is is crazy now the reason by the way that he is even the Democratic nominee is

clear winner I think they both did well in the debate I think there will be a clear winner and the election and are they both gained a great deal of national publicity\nOn Ted Cruz actually I think spoke effectively talking about the craziness that has infected so much of the left and the kind of craziness to which his opponent beta or work is playing listen\nYou are right that there there is a loss of civility there is an anger there is a rage on the far left of it is really frightening [noise] you know the images and let me answer with the owner of the images of of left wing mom says ... all the doors of the Supreme Court\nFor our country we can disagree will fruiting each other with respect will treating each other with civility\nOkay I I think that some fat ugly true\nAnd part of that incivility or appeared on the um on the Internet this morning right after the debate where the ... people are packaging what you're about to hear as some kind of why\nAnd and by the way your film even in the theatrical release had a tremendous impact and the proof of that is\nBusiness Insider just a compiled a list based on information from the critical aggregator met a critic\nAnd they were asking question which has always been a great concern to me which is what's the worst movie ever made and uh my brother Harry and I have done books about that but uh they came up with a list I'm Seventy five\nOf films that were the worst ever made\nThe a six worst film ever made according them was Hillary's America your film\nAnd the worst film ever made was this new film what is that what the hell out of the nation that led a little critics all of them are left wing by the way I mean well virtually a hundred percent what is it about your film that you think lead people to designated as the worst film in history\nI think quite simply that when you imagine a left wing critic particularly somebody call is over the paintings are really the result of emotion dog parks in like that\nWalking into the theater and seeing\nAll of their basic assumption just put ... overturned and done so in in ... intellectually powerful way I mean I don't know how to respond so they're very discombobulated and angry and when they leave the theater there\n... or ... how do I ... and they don't realize that the way that they can get it is by writing a review that says I agree with the movie but I don't know why\nOr I don't have good arguments to counter this but they say extremely boring movie where it will be ever made couldn't wait to watch the first ten minutes so\nThis is the way in which it intellectually and emotionally immature people\nWere on when their world was over time\nI look I I think there's a great deal to what you're saying because I recently Michael Moore came out with his new movie Fahrenheit eleven nine\nEr and er this is a movie about supposedly about Donald Trump and how he's ruining American is the end of the world and the movie had tremendous hype it had very good reviews though not so much for me and a and it proceeded to bomb Mayes he's actually going to end up reaching a fraction of the people you reach with death of America\nWell the thing to realize is that Michael Moore problem with the ... of it is back in Studio give him the money to make the movies he's on every talk show he gets old severed republic pretty whereas I only\nI mean it's my movie with mentioned on ABC NBC Phoebe out\nA little worried about it from CNN or MSN keep the ... yard at not covered at all so good luck to sort of they they go out of their way or the film and yet despite all that and Michael Moore by the way opened seven hundred with theater we'll ...\nTheaters and we did about a famous the opening weekend and it will be ... like a stone\nSo it had years kind of guy and that makes the heart of it is that look I'm not making the point here on the ideological acts like\nMichael Moore first so a a a which was a clever little the NFL Bush's case there are adequate she quit at that point\nYeah well the point about this new film I Know you haven't seen it I have Michael Moore's movie didn't ashes movie death of a nation or you can stream right now at death of a nation movie dot com\nBut the other point about Moore's movie it begins almost identical to your movie except your movie covers the materials so much better it so much more ...\nAnd it's actually very funny the way you do it what you do at the beginning of the film is you go back to election night and you show the change from the beginning of election night where the anger is the beginning they are all happy and excited they are about to welcome the first female president and Hillary of course is going to win\nAnd then you show the increasing desperation and heartbreak as it becomes clear that the result wasn't what people expected\nMichael Moore does the same thing but he doesn't play it for laughs he plays it oh my goodness this is the beginning of a nightmare and a tragedy and it's not watch of all\nI'm ... in terms of my response to the film the one segment of the film that I think is most unforgettable is your amazing ah interview with Richard Spencer a leading a leader of what people call white supremacists neo Nazi American opinion\nExplain what you found out that was so groundbreaking it's a real revelation an eye opener in the film death of the nation\n[noise] well I was thinking to myself I'm Michael that it's one thing to say that historically the Democratic party the party of racism or the Democratic party had a fascist going going back to be a Ninety thirties if another thing to say where is the racism today\nAnd on the left would seem to have a Trump Card\nWhich is that basically look at all these white nationalists Charlotte's red light and so on and so am I going to a Compaq certainly make America great again hat so clearly a white supremacy now is on the right\nOkay but people are going to see this for themselves because what they find from Richard Spencer is that no he's a left us he's a socialist he's somebody on the\nLeft that's one of the revelations you'll get when you go to death of a nation movie dot com it's

analytics\nWhere they're trying to figure out who's really going to win the election if any of our state wide candidates is going to be the Senate races Martha McSally allegation is scarce and send them again when what's gonna happen to the gubernatorial race in eastern looking across the nation are we going to swing\nRight do you think that the Democrats are going to pick up the majority in the house I'm really actually curious what you think as we get through and we start working out through cells to this conversation that want you to engage in this conversation because\nThere are definite and clear signals signals one way or the other and I'm curious how you approach the signals of even field a mercy them so we'll go into that in some detail so kind of hang tight because I think that's a big question a lot of you have is which way this house going to go\nI mean again if if the if the Democrats pick up the house majority you know immediately the following day or when the seats kick into place when the at the turn of the year you're going to have them do what they're gonna teach\nDonald J ... remember impeachment by way of the word is just the beginning to the house the Senate they don't have a chance and heck\nThey're going to pick up the Senate but that's where it dies just like it did with President Bill Clinton when he was impeached and just that word going along I guess it kinda fits in a sense because of Donald Trump's and beat up called everything since he's been ah the president and then the the chief commander here of our country her commander in chief\nAnd it it just it seems apropos in a way and maybe it's a good way to finish it off but I Want to tell you one thing is I get nervous because I Want to have the policies the process of the successes that we've had with the president's agenda to keep pushing forward and what happens here in our house in our state\nThe Senate here in our state the house and the Senate and the national level if they don't line up with the president is not the same party a lot of times it can swoop policy down to a crawl and sometimes it doesn't even happens so you can have a great vision from the current president\nAnd because of the house is no longer in control the Republicans are just stopped right there\nNever advances for it and then that's where you get aggressive presidents like President Obama with the executive order and starts doing things that just made all of our heads kind of spin you start to see the agency step and more aggressively and that's not good for Americans the right way is the vote for people get them into office and then make sure we have good outcomes in right now we've had\nEvery opportunity to articulate the fantastic vision that fantastic principles and values a Republican president brings to better jobs better economic growth\nBetter safety more protection of everybody's religions more freedom for the concept the media doesn't like the fact that he's pushing back on 'em and they say things like oh he's infringing on our freedom of speech wrong\nFreedom of speech doesn't mean you can meet all liars it means that you can talk and be openly share ideas and such and not worry about getting your head came to it\nSo we come back we've got Mike Noble coming on we've got a a candidate for secretary of state Republican candidate Steve Gainer you got to hear him you got to get people out there to vote they put the full court press on we'll talk to the numbers of what the left is doing Soros fires\nAnd the other is trying to pick up that seat and the pound on them the best they possibly can get is critically important that we protect it and do what we can and I get over that very very very first time\nI saw again making sure that we have good outcomes and making sure that we're absolutely\nCapable of winning and turnout is what it's all about last thing that all kind of step into is that in our last hour toward then Corey Lewandowski\nPresident Donald Trump's primary candidate her campaign manager will be joining us and we will make sure that you hear from him first and you see the outcome and ultimately what is um in store for our nation he's got a very different perspective as it relates to\nEverything and so as we cruise through this and as we make sure that we are lined up properly he's going to give us a perspective from a national standard a lot of times we get in this little myopic little box here in Arizona\nAnd we don't find our way to the best information and so when you have somebody like Cory who touches on all the different elements he gets a different perspective he feels that he sees it see one of the things about politics too it's not a perfect science\nAnd so when you see somebody processing through the information it's pretty it's pretty overwhelming sometimes to try to do it yourself but when you hear somebody that takes very complex concepts and dies him down to very specific simple ideas for us to listen to you\nThen you started to go okay I got it I see what's going to see what's happening and I see what the outcome is going to be like\nSo again making sure that we get to that point is critically important and I'm having a best best best possible are now going back to everything when we look at what's happening in the White House and we look at the headline news today if you go to political you go to\nFox if you go to the hill Huffington Post\nYou go to a Financial Times all of these different publications take a look at policy politics\nFinancial environments everything that they can to try to report now do you think people spin information absolutely they do so one of the things that I've made a habit of doing it I Would encourage you to do is not just become academic on the issue so we're talking about trade\nIf we're talking about foreign policy for talking about other elements of national defense and stuff where should read about it right get perspective that we can on a more the academic standpoint\nAnd then when it comes to arguments when it comes about making decisions on day to day basis it's critically important important for you to know how policy is going to impact you but also how are people spinning\nWhat are the conversations that are happening on the left or right if you go to the Huffington Post and you start to kind of walk through this and look at you know what they're doing reports and they and they go right through the headlines and and um it'll be\nPretty telling to see which way they spend if you shoot over to the hill you get a feel for which where they're going to spend just by their headlights you go to Fox same deal you go to political same deal you go to the hill and on and on and on and the thing they don't want to point out to you is that recognize you've got to put your felt drawn to some degree\nRe read it listen to it maybe there'll be some videos that are attached to give you more clarity on factual things that are said or done\nBut then you get a return back now a Garcia so you've got Garcia is running for governor here in the state of Arizona against governor Doug do seem\nNow what's really interesting for me is that when they had this last debate if he didn't see it governor do see kept referencing certain points of information about David Garcia\nAnd Garcia says that's not true and\nGoing to do see what did he say go look at it yourself fact check Garcia dot com fact check Garcia dot com and you can see yourself so when that debate was going on I had my computer my lap I pulled it up looked at it and and David Garcia's words own words he said exactly what ... does he claimed did set\nThere was no like cut on one side cut another side splicing things together it was one continuous speech that he was talking about\nAnd to the audience he was speaking to us probably appropriate in a sense where he was pandering to try to get votes so maybe a little hard line on this little more hard line on that but nonetheless it shows it in the lack of integrity of that particular candidate so when you see things like video it's great because then he got\nHe really did say that Oh yes the Billy Bush video down Trump there is no sugar coating that right he said it and nobody ever said he didn't say that\nFrance to meet with them for a year they've got that call pretty

stepping in and it's a good time I Love talking politics and what's happening around the world\nEspecially with our economy we've got John to rescue the John how are you sir hey Robert good to talk to you you as well how are things are happening around this wild and crazy economic world Luis we've we've seen the changes and I feel like we've been here before\nWhy spend a little ... saw the past couple of weeks I've been talking with Seth about this of course markets up and down pretty uh\nUm you know big swings we've been seeing yesterday the Dow was up five hundred and forty seven points but today we had a little struggle it was a whip sewing back and forth between positive and negative\nFinally ending up slightly down today a but we're looking really had a few other er into indications here we saw a oil or making it a pretty big drop and and it's a price per barrel down below Seventy dollars\nA finding that we've got us crude stockpiles are\nMore than we expected which is a good thing right this is going to keep that price of oil down which have the issues going on right now with Saudi Arabia who potentially is saying they may or do a little manipulation with oil prices so it's good to see that we've got a lot of stockpiling up our own\nAnd we would be able to probably work through some of those issues if anything happened on that and\nUh also looks like the president is finally talking about a budget and trying to cut spending and this is a good thing I don't know if you saw this article about the president's talking about each cabinet secretary slashing their budget by about five percent as he pledges to cut spending\nYeah that that is a music store years all of us I think the the gross spending and they needed spending is crazy that's sort of see
