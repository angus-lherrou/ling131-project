{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "Over centuries in factories in generations um attacked in that way that hadn't been the case of a history of black supremacy on Jews or on white people or something like that so there are different impact of that\nI I agree I agree and again I I think it is obviously much more serious if somebody in public office say is\nSaying something that is negatively racist then if somebody like Louis Farrakhan of saying it however I think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he'd received from David Duke because even though David Duke is a joke\nA loser and a creep and a former klansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above a she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan because if you look at Farrakhan history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country\nThe idea that he should be on stage as he was that Aretha Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist but you you simply can't\nAll of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at\nThis point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people and as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill deserves some kind of sanction go ahead like yeah I\nI I understand that Michael connected one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are you know very hatred of the there have full of of whites where it's coming from ... in a kind of a revolution are fighting back\nAbout what happened to them as a people over time whereas\nThe other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever they wouldn't have packing people not because they did anything to them they made up conspiracy theory and made up that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications\nFor that genocide which was real and it happened and and also make knowledge of Iraq and so the Armenian people were a cruel to the Turks and they were undermining the it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith and there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you ought to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people should John you\nLet's go to Calvin in Columbus ohio Calvin you're on the ...\nAnd Michael thanks for taking my call you that one\nI just wanted to mention a little bit uh I Do agree with a lot of what you're saying and I absolutely don't condone any type or not you're from but I Do think that a calling out ... issues um\nIs not a bad thing for instance two percent of the population of the world which are which is a Jewish population a run\nOn now it's not as much less corrupt okay much less a\nIt's two percent of the American population\nBut I'll go ahead and we'll we'll just go with two percent of the American population but runs a hundred percent of the media oh of course that's nonsense so of course that's nonsense let me let me know\nCalvin I Can't let you finish one what you just said is nonsense when you say runs a hundred percent of the media I mean it's it's complete garbage\nOh okay so so I take Fox News for instance in who runs uh MSNBC\nAnd okay at first of all Jews do not run either of those networks you have Jeff Zucker who happens to be Jewish is an executive at CNN shirt you at Fox News you have the a C B that\nThese are you OK who owns these companies I'm not sitting at the bad thing I'm saying\nNow do you are you are saying it said what you're saying is a lie this is an old Nazi lie and you will never get anywhere trying to talk to people by advancing old and discredited Nazi lives have you noticed Fox News is by far the dominant cable network right\nNow it's like an email you\nKnow stop or you can email me Nazi crap Patel there I understand let me just ask you are you aware of Fox News\nI'm very aware of okay who owns Fox News or I mean I think I'm saying and I think I've said\nNo who owns Fox News tell me\nI can I Do have you ever heard of Rupert Murdoch or them okay have you ever heard of News Corp [noise] ah no I haven't\nNews Corp is Rupert Murdoch's company does Fox News and the wall Street Journal and the New York post and a bunch of other end by like find company but Rupert Murdoch is not Jewish had Roger ales who started Fox News is not Jewish and very ... very very few of the\nPeople involved with that network happened to be Jewish and that's the leading cable network by far\nThe the notion of Jewish control of the media is a lie it's there I say it's all new\n\nLife insurance is tremendously important that's always been my conviction but it's amazing that a third of all people don't have any life insurance at all and it's because it's really hard to buy and sometimes\nYou have to work out what exactly you need then do all the research to find the best quote and hope you don't get swindled

part of my show research\nBut it is I advertised as the young person's guide to conquering and saving the world that was very nice\nSo uh this was tweeted out this reporting for a million followers can't and poverty\nWithout ending capitalism exclamation point does anyone think that's true for even a minute\nYou can't and poverty without ending capitalism one of the questions and a half of the folks at teen vote is I assume that a teen vogue they sell a bunch of beauty products and stylish clothes and\nHow how are you supposed to pay for that without capitalism would there be a government program to provide you with the same kind of style as close that for instance they used to enjoy in the old Soviet Union\nOr in cube of the revolution or Mao's China now that is in the clothes that you didn't want to take off the dead bodies the Seventy five million yes it's Seventy five million people who were killed by the Maoist regime\nAnd it's just an unbelievable thing\nAnd it's

you're going to have um you have a tough time in life\nBy the way teen vogue is owned by advance publications which saw revenues of over two point four billion dollars in two thousand six to eight\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number this came in from Jake in Seattle Jake writes in pretty sad to hear you get on the Mumbai train\nI was saying that I think it's post totally legitimate to say that one of the tactics the Democrats have used in this campaign then is unique to this campaign\nIs basically dispatching mobs some of which we understand are affiliated with organizations that are well funded\nTo disrupt Republican events to get into people's faces to ah basically misbehave and contributed to this atmosphere of violence and confrontation\nJake says pretty sad to hear you get on the mom trained I've never had much or any respect for you well thank you are but I thought you were above that\nWas anyone calling the Tea Party protestors in two thousand Thirteen a mom\nIt's a talking point Michael and you can't be above that nonsense if you partake in it okay\nHere's the challenge to you out there and I'll take calls on it can you give me an example where any of the Tea Party sessions acted like a mom\nWhere they tried to show someone down where they tried to disrupt something I mean when you're talking about mom to think about those code paying more ons\nWho continually continuing continually it was literally several times in our disrupted the Kavanaugh hearings who flooded congressional offices one of the hallmarks of the Tea Party and I saw when my own eyes\nThese are people who clean up after themselves they would've giant rallies and a giant march on Washington one that was run by Glenn Beck I think that two hundred thousand people there that a ton of people\nAnd they made a very big point of asking people to pick up their litter and you can compare that to the inauguration crown\nOr any inauguration crowd you cannot compare and the same way\nThat very very regularly or there would be people dispatched to conservative political rallies and he asked this includes Trump rallies to try to disrupt them to shell out and be carried away\nAt it I won't say it never happens but it's very rarely happens with liberal candidates do you remember a time when when Hillary was forced to confront angry people\nChanting it her or President Obama\nI I Do remember there were a couple of cases where President Obama had a heckler any handled it very well in very classy and fine but it's so rare\nAnd uh again right now in this campaign\nYou have major political figures like the if the Democrats take over the house of representatives Maxine Waters Los Angeles will be the chair of the house committee on financial services it's big money has to do is regulating banks\nMaxine Waters is openly said that it is appropriate to act like a mom and to get into people's faces Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine shell I'm\nTed Cruz and Heidi have been basically assaulted at dinner we played the other day or a segment of Ted Cruz being assaulted at the airport just the lack of decorum the mobster tactics\n... that's what we're talking about and it is not equally distributed you cannot find current examples about that that are prominent\nOn the conservative side of things\nLet's go to your calls to Jake in Philadelphia Jake you're on the man that show disagreement day\nWhere Michael I disagree with your you have a term anti Semitism it should be anti Judaism and hatred of Jews and their religious\nWell no uh because of Hitler made a a very big point of killing people including people who were Jews would converted to Catholicism uh there there is a saint of the Catholic Church who was a former Jewish communist intellectual\nAloe what Hitler's friend or the semi the mafia of Jerusalem\nOkay right I ... I understand but the term anti Semitism was originally coined in Europe in central directs\nBy a hold on hold on and it was coined by people to describe a hatred of Jews and you're right the Jews have been European for a long time but this argument about a ... whether it is it real anti Judaism and it is it is not a\nReligious argument that goes down to religion\nIt does not go down to religion you heard that I I'm ... I'm Sorry sir they are from the church it started from the church fathers okay it it\nDid not start from the church fathers had started long before that if you read about the book investor which dramatizes events in the fifth century bc\nLike pharmaceutical drugs\nWhat scared to do that and I didn't want to become reliant on it so with a combination of therapy and smoking marijuana I Am recovering\nI'm very happy for you and I'm Glad to hear it and marijuana is legal medical marijuana has been illegal for\nA long time um but you said and you're right you didn't want to become dependent on some of the pharmaceutical drugs shouldn't you also be concerned about becoming dependent on marijuana\nYes I actually am that is a concern of mine um however I proven to myself I'm a numerous times that\nLike I'll go I'd I'd gone through ... fans in the past ... years of no you and then I you her cage and all and then I can like turn it down that OK early when I Do use I use it right before a therapy session I adore\nAnd and again and you're you're getting medical and psychological attention and and that's good and I hope everything should continue to be better for you ... the basic position that I Would have on marijuana is is simply that being dependent on anything\nIs not great uh I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading a they have a thing in the New York times I have a advice column called sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nOn saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and they say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids said at the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month at lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful but\nThe ideas looked life life has all kinds of challenges and sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly with opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything\nDon't make things more difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary let's go to a Lauren in Houston you're on the Michael ... shows disagreement day\nHi Michael I and my ... today is that we should be hoping our fifth Saudi Arabia why\nUm because it's carrying on hundreds of thousands of Yemeni people it's bad and it's not a good influence for the United states towards other countries\nUm an because he already has jeopardizing live in farm okay what what what I think what we were media elite is taking our influence in our leadership position in from other countries\nOkay Lauren and Lauren what do you think would happen if a President Trump all of a sudden it's announced okay okay uh we're canceling this arms deal with Saudi Arabia where they're buying a hundred billion dollars worth of our arms that we make here what what would happen and you think they would get their arms from somewhere else\nI sure am\nI absolutely they would they would probably get them from China or Russia and a ... again what have we accomplished ... I Do I Believe that Saudi Arabia's a problematic country I think it's a corrupt and brutal autocracy is a very problematic country\nBut do I believe that it would help the United states to completely

not the point there are all kinds of convert to Judaism including members of my immediate family who have limited Jewish background some but limited Jewish background genetically or ethnically\nBut they choose to live as part of a Jewish community and specifically they choose to live religiously\nAnd this is really the problem with Elizabeth Warren is she was claiming to be a diversity hire at Harvard\nShe had put this on Harvard she'd even contributed to a cookbook done by the Harvard Native American community called powwow chow\nAnd her whole identification\nWith Native American identity

Lewis fair can\nLet us not forget that just two months ago Lewis Farah can was front and center on a stage with Bill Clinton Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton\nThey were truly paddling around before they even got on stage smiles and shoulder grabs and all Farah Ken Sarah can [noise]\nHe has said such wonderful things is quote say ten of Jews have infected the whole world with poison and deceit close quote quote to Jews have control over those agencies of government when you want something in this world the Jew holds the door close quote quote Jews were responsible for all of the filth\nAnd degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men and women women into men\nWhite folks are going down and ... going down and Farah can by God's Grace has pulled the cover off\nThe seed panic Jew and I'm here to say your time is up your world is through\nYour good Jews better separate because the satanic ones will take you to hell with them because that's where they are headed close quote quote it is now becoming a parent there were many Israelis and scientists Jews and key roles in the nine eleven attacks Israelis had for knowledge of the attacks\nWe know that many Jews received a text message to come to work\nOn September eleventh close quote\nI was just a few samples and from this year not the distant past well over the weekend there man fair can compare Jews to termites he also put that comparison up on Twitter\nTwitter will not remove Bill Clinton will not condemning him Jackson and Sharpton sure won't well anyone in the Democratic party\nWho cares about human rights civil rights decency and who play capes voting blocks not with dog whistles but embraces the jackals like Louis Vera can\nMeanwhile think about what the left did to Kanye West for supporting not fair can with Donald Trump is mental health was made fun of he was called the ... he was called the house negro he was called an example of what happens and blacks don't learn to read\n[noise] beautiful stuff isn't it [noise]\nBut ... is I think and was I think on to something as Victor Davis Hanson rights today the provocative Donald Trump's certainly seems to be disliked by a majority of African American professional athletes cable news hosts academics and certainly the Congressional Black caucus yeah\nThere are subtle but increasing indications that his approval among other African Americans maybe reaching historic highs for a modern Republican president\n[noise] some polls indicated that Trump's approval approval rating among black voters as close to twenty percent that is far higher than the eight percent of the African American vote the Trump received on election day twenty sixteen [noise]\nA recent Rasmussen report poll shows African American approval of Trump could be as high as thirty six percent even twenty percent of African American support for Trump would all but dismantle Democratic Party presidential hopes for twenty twenty\nHillary Clinton lost the twenty sixteen election was eighty eight percent of the black vote that was about six point fall off from Brock Obama share of the black folk and twenty twelve\nBut far more importantly an estimated two million of the African American voters have cast ballots for Obama in twenty twelve simply did not show up at the polls in twenty sixteen to vote for Hillary Clinton\nBy the way they think of what Kanye West could do on the campaign trail for Donald Trump put those two million non voters\nBut why is the supposedly odious Trump having any success and undermining the traditional marriage between African Americans and Democrats most recent job report revealed that the unemployment rate for African American teenagers fell to Nineteen point three percent the lowest figure in history\nThat number stands and market contrast to the twenty ten rate forty eight point nine percent under the Obama administration think about that Nineteen percent forty percent\nOverall black unemployment is currently at five point nine percent which is close to a record low\nUnder Trump the economy is growing it nearly four percent a year the robust growth coincides with Trump's efforts to curb illegal immigration and imported labor the net result has been to empower minority job applicants and ways not seen in nearly fifty years\nTrump's implicit message is that every American worker\nEvery American worker is now crucial and maintaining the red hot economy\nIn a job shorter ... laborers suddenly have a lot of leverage over their employers and wages are rising\nTrump should stress other issues that might appeal to African Americans as well such as the rights of access to charter schools and how boutique environmentalism and overregulation drive up the cost of affordable housing fuel\nAnd electricity just so\nIt is perhaps true that we're at once thought may indeed come to pass that Donald Trump could be some kind of post partisan Republican president changing traditional partisan voting blocks that time could be here\nIt very well could and not just with African Americans but perhaps even with females of all colors and Jewish Americans\nThink about what you could do with those votes that con you could get even half of them even half of them well and that's Michael the dean would\nPeople who participated in the million Man March in Nineteen Ninety five headed by ... which really made in prominence in American politics so people are ... just faded in the margins\nProudly defended it seemed like he was and work closely with a ferret on these folks have a special obligation\nTo condemn a look at\nChelsea Clinton your credit whatever way condemns or aren't remarks I Wish I could have done it because what is next to Derek on at the funeral of Franklin and he has a special obligation to so I think silence there's not an appropriate response to a fair cause very well\nAnd in fact Allen I'm Mr Khan has referred to Hillary Clinton as wicked woman you can hear her to Hitler as well so you're disappointed that we haven't heard from black leaders but you're also disappointed we haven't heard from democratic leaders as well\n[noise] I'm disappointed that whole nation people had been universally together\nOr to condemn it there is a social obligation just like this special obligation to the both the extreme right to condemn the oil price may in cages anti Semitism or bigotry special obligation to people on the left of black leaders\nDemocratic leader so out of their way to condemn this because there is a fairly large following right and many voters to vote Democrat so there's a special obligation\nTo condemn those who are speaking on your side of the issues but why don't they [noise]\nI guess the fear of losing the base or you know there are many voters and some people are more now\nFrom what I was a dark all his um Gary's can become swing voters and people don't want to lose their state we're seeing other Republicans I was struck Republicans route fishing condemn you just watch them as voters every American as we get together and say we don't want you know different about this is\nThis notion of be All right as being in any way comparable to Louis Farah can uh it it's it's it's simply first of all I don't know how right the alt right is if you've seen diminished as soon as this movie looks like it's probably more progressive and more left wing\nThen or anything having to do with conservative second uh made me made me made me a a a charismatic or well known leader of the ... right as I say\nThese guys get together occasionally and can someone dozens\nWhen Louis Farrakhan wants to he can summon tens of thousands and that would have included Brock\nObama that his million Man March is certainly included Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and Bill Clinton\nIn August at a rate to Franklin's Juno but silent silence on what's the silence of these people it's incredible the second and a triple a third standards that they apply this incredible ... can talk about ... something up and it's headlines for days\nThis kind of thing or just love to fly and Bill Clinton stays silent and Nancy Pelosi stay silent\nAnd Chuck Schumer stays silent heaven for found they might just lose a couple of black votes\nBut what price is worth that victory when that victory comes with the man who is ...
