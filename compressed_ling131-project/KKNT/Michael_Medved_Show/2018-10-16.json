Medicare for none because this system is already in trouble it's cash strapped this will make it totally unsustainable and change America in a way that most Americans are going to suffer\nAmerican culture and politics [noise] so what's going on\nAnd on a they're a great day in this greatest nation on God's green earth a great day when as the Democrats go into their last three weeks in a determined attempt to take over the Congress of the United states [noise]\nI uh I think it's worth asking\nOkay let's say he win and you win based upon the whole thrust of his concluding campaign the whole thrust of this concluding campaign [noise]\nWe are angry women are angry and supposedly angry about ah Christine Blasey Ford and angry about hashtags me to an angry about powerful men and angry most of all about President Trump remembers the\nResist a moment okay there are tons of angry\nWomen out there and right now in the media mind they are led by Hillary Rodham Clinton\nAgain that went well a andme by Elizabeth Warren yeah that's going well and here's my basic question\nAside from the personalities of some of these angry women there's a new book and I had read it but it just amazes me that they've published a book and think this is going to really speak to this moment in our history has by someone named Rebecca Traister\nAnd it's called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nUh-huh\n... what is the power of women's anger and what's the purpose of that women's anger let's say for justice for the sake of argument and I'm Serious I Will let you express this please\nLet's say that this record number of women who are running for office on the Democratic side and then also record numbers of women running on the Republican side but leave that alone for a moment let's say all these angry democratic women\nWin and they come sweeping into Congress what's gonna happen next\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six how will it make America better how old it enrich\nOur life as a nation or one of the points of Gerald science makes in his column today most Street Journal is that is each it's more likely not ... that\nThere will be a divided outcome in this election he says look it's possible that the Republicans will hold on in the house and they'll definitely hold on the Senate\nAnd yes that's possible it's also possible that the way the sun likely but it's possible that the Democrats will make the house that they could easily do and take this and that that's going to be much harder for them\nBut the most likely outcome that the Republicans hold the Senate probably adding to our sit majority and or the Democrats takes house narrowly\n[noise] so what does that look my girls\nSide says is that looks like and even more divided America even more bitterness even more constant nonsense about the end of the world and if this happens and we can go on and this was the end of America as we know it more apocalyptic insanity\nTo the American people really want that if you're\nVoting for the angry women now there let me just give you some flavor of this this is the way that this new book good and mad as written about\n[noise] uh this is the Meyer says uh\nHas its velocity partners ... says in USA Today as America grapples with the hashtag me too movement tidal wave Rebecca Traister his new book good and mad the revolution and power of women's anger\nServes as an amen sister venting session that's what we need a vending fashion you can do vending session right here one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Traister hits pause on current events to explain what's fueling the rage\nAnd she assures the reader that it's okay to be angry\nAnd the book starts out by talking about a blank not a bank Abe rank what does a blank a blank is also known as a which is bridal\nIt was a Muslim torture device from the Fifteen hundreds put on women's jaws to prevent them from talking\nVia the radio says a book that talks about a blank isn't going to mince words red hot emotions sheep from the plaque type on the page you can practically hear Traister striking each letter on our keyboard\nLike a permit GIF okay\nSounds like a lot of fun a just a just a great deal of fun and just like Hillary when uh uh she was on TV interviewed on CBS\nAnd she was interviewed about uh bringing up to date her approach to a an abuse of power in a sexual arena listen\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct\nNone no no no oh I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House inter today have said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think [noise]\nFilter to resign in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of United States cannot have a consensual relationship with in in terms of power imbalance as to why\nAn adult and get us where the investigation of the current incumbent against whom numerous allegations have been made and which have dismisses denies and ridicules so there wasn't investigations and\nHas I Believe came out in the right place [noise]\nIt it came out in the right place showing that the president was guilty of lying and obstructing justice but people should really read Ken's stars book as his book is called contempt and\nBy the way it gives the light of what Hillary's says she did nothing to demean the character of the president's accuser she did a great deal she did a great deal to demand the character of Ken Starr who was a special counsel's a former federal judge who was an honorable and decent and patriotic individual\nDo you remember the term vast right wing conspiracy she kept saying up to the very very end up to the final DNA test and know that DNA test\nCame out much more conclusively the lives of the war as it has to do with a blue dress and something on that blue dress you may recall\nUp until that DNA test came out she was absolutely convinced the bill was as pure as the driven snow an innocent as he could be and this was all a vast right wing conspiracy it was um the ultimate conspiracy theory\nOf ... what what is she doing for her claws here actually\nOn MSNBC or in the Morning Joe show him ... talked about this and then Joe Scarborough chimed in and listen\nThan the last few days talking about fail and Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren planned for twenty twenty [noise] are they missing that lasted ... days ahead critical midterm\nThey are dying for better will guy twenty two day sales to sell me today from Hillary right now talking about [noise]\nMonica Lewinsky than adults at the age of twenty paint when she was taken advantage of avenue a severe election what ... what do you think that they don't come after me please this is not what the democratic plan to\nGo down okay go to the phone banks toys away from blenders and your kids you call the Democratic voters\nDon't hurt the cause of\nGermany was a reference to blenders in your kitchen is that I mean I'm drinking something or is putting your hand in a blender to destroy I don't know what what is that\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six at Trevor Noah I'm who doesn't generally make fun of the left I felt they had to hear listen or perish the investigation\nOf the current income than snow all have ... [noise]\nI'm Sorry I'm a little kid ripping us all cool maybe it was different in the nineties but today I think we're all understanding that there's a massive power imbalance between an intern and the president of the United states tried to get into an apartment with anyone as a power imbalance personal bomb attacks to me are you from are you all\n[noise] he'd be like I don't know if you're watching the game and I'll be like oh yeah I knew that I knew that of course Hillary tried to deflect and make this about Trump like you're not in a position to be throwing stones at someone Henry especially when you actually sitting in laws' house [noise]\nOkay this is is truly a strange\nToday by the way I'm pretty sure is the anniversary of a um another fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and two athletes or John Carlos and Tommie Smith\nWho won a gold medal and a bronze medal and they stood there on the stage and they held up their gloves hands in a black power salute and basically it changed their lives\nDid accomplish something profound do these protests matter\nAnd what is it that the new wave of women is supposed to accomplish in terms of changing America and the Congress of the United states one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six David in Philadelphia you're on the Michael ... show\n'em while and no way one to defend Bill Clinton\nUh it was interesting when you play those excerpts to cheer for money people making the point that there is a power imbalance between him and Monica Lewinsky which invalidated the relationship or made it akin to rape or assault or what have you and I would just\nOr not but one of the most well known facts of male female sexual dynamics of the\nWomen tend to be attracted to powerful men [noise] uh not so much the other direction by the way men don't necessarily [laughter] aren't necessarily truck into our for women so if you want to invalidate the [noise] you know those kinds of relationships there could be\nEven angrier more frustrated women than the one who wrote the book you mentioned\nWhat is it I think the problem in and the abuse of power the abuse of power was not only\nIn terms of pursuing their relationship which certainly Monica Lewinsky was very enthusiastic about there's no question about it\nBut uh was\nIn concealing their relationship and a and hitting back at a great number of people and by the way using federal resources\nIt's it's so astonishing that right now people on the left I mean I Know on cable TV all morning they've been dealing with President Trump's angry reaction to Stormy Daniels that entire matter as embarrassing untold raise it may be\nInvolves the time before President Trump was in the White House long before\nAnd uh does that mean that it's utterly irrelevant no I mean there there are ongoing legal action some of which by the way has been dismissed that that Stormy Daniels defamation\nSuit has been dismissed she can't sue President Trump for saying that she's not telling the truth let us go to Lou in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the ...\nOkay I'm Michael I'm Out when you're talking about the anger thing there's there's two points I Want to make is one is that of course there's always angry and show the response he gives an angry response to something\nAnd then the only way to respond with that same kind of anger it makes sense right that's the way he communicates the second point\nI Want to make is that um\nWhen has a went out there in things against a man or against you know\nThere's things against the women that happened and they're responding to the issue that happen [noise]\n[noise] yeah but what what is it the thing against women that happens is there's so much of this that is on\nEarth for years and years ago like the charges by Christine Blasey Ford [noise]\nWhat is accomplished by the protests and the anger and how is that supposed to work to benefit the country\nIs there an example of that was

women are angry amount\nAnd ...\nIs is a great deal of is just personal about President Trump that a President Trump reminds many women not all there are a lot of women who love President Trump by the way President Trump won a majority of white female voters he did not a huge majority but by eight points\nAnd a Allen stepped in he's also the owner of the Portland TrailBlazers he uh actually always liked basketball more than football apparently but he came to be\nAlmost a model owner for the Seahawks the the one point that I Would make about him as there is a general resentment of\nRich people of billionaires Paul Allen was reputed to be worth about twenty billion dollars that's let's be clear twenty thousand million dollars\nAnd if you think about that that's just an almost unimaginable amount of money he is given at least two billion dollars to charities since his\nInitial a cancer diagnosis and the charities have been so wide ranging and for the most part so noble poll gee Allen philanthropies\n... has been emphasizing the environment including preserving or some some wilderness areas and in global health and helping with diseases like Ebola\nBut he's also had more local focus and and this is one thing that I wanted to to speak about in particular it's very unusual for somebody to\nBasically grow up in a place he was born in Seattle his father was one of the chief librarians at University of Washington\nAnd he grew up here and he came back here and he said just an enormous impact on the city almost all of it very very positive it could have been more positive one of the things that I first admired about Paul Allen is he was pushing a plan called the Seattle comments\nWhich would have been a terrific sixty one acre park right in the middle of the city where it would have replaced\nAt a a bunch of warehouses and a ferry fairly rundown area of town with a great green space coming back from lake union\nAnd uh and then that would have been surrounded by housing buildings and office buildings in any event it was turned down in a city vote a right the same year that we we arrived we moved to Seattle a city vote was incredibly close\nAnd but it was turned down and so now there are lots and lots of office buildings in that same area many of them by the way developed by Paul Allen's company Vulcan\nBut he built the museum of popular culture which used to be called the experience music project he was a huge fan of Jimmy hendrix who was a Seattle boy\nAnd he wanted to commemorate Jimi Hendrix originally then this development as big museum with a controversial building by Frank Gehry some people hate the architecture's others love it\nHe um owns a Portland TrailBlazers down in Portland and the Seattle Seahawks he developed the Allen Institute for brain science and the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence he also has this other very cool museum it's called the flying heritage in combat armor museum\nWhich is a collection of vintage military aircraft tanks and other military hardware yes living computer museum that he built the the point about this is that so many people and the idea of why don't we take more money away from rich people pull out had more money than he needed\nAnd the answer the energy and the creativity and the love with which he spends his money was a a true factor about\nUh the the success that he had with these various projects and most of them were quite successful and they made a difference the notion that the government could have spent this money better than\nPaul Allen I think is fallacious he should rest in peace his sister and his other survivors should be comforted and his memory should be a blessing [noise] okay meanwhile there's a big new movie from the marvel comics folks

he's a very good I think he is a\nUm punching above his wait for the job that he has had in these debates and a clearly a has a bias that have shown a in the interest to seize um it it that is to say in when you look in between\nA little bit um the uh the overall debates or when you look at what questions he gives who who he presses what on\nA that needle is a little sharper towards the right that is to save a little harder towards the conservatives no big surprise it being the media is being PBS but the idea that a he's a just even Steven Mr moderate is not true\nA mix Sally or got her Irish up at the end and rightfully so because it was odd to say the least\nThat on one of the main issues of our day never mind one of the main areas of expertise for Martha McSally which is to say the military and national security didn't get one question\nDidn't get one question\nWhich are not only foreclosed opening up her on her expertise but of course for clothes and a lot a lot of questions about cursing sentiments passed\nSo good from Sally in how she wedge did in there at the very end I'm Anthony has a has that audio so this was basically the last question they were given it was a question on water\nOr water or water use water rights and water in Arizona not unimportant issue I Will say for the technocrats ah mostly\nI have a hard time believing truly\nHonestly have a hard time believing anyone in Arizona tuned in to hear what their perspectives we're on water I really have a hard time believing that\nBut you know it's very brie and Shibley and PBS to do that sort of thing but I also have to say I think it was Phil or to take it off military and a ... good for her kind of shame to the hosts on it\nAnd the hosts are moderators had nowhere to go but to let her run with it and as I say I think she did a very good job with it so here was how ... handled it\nBe able to move forward to and dressing is really important issues but we have to talk about the military we have to talk about our veterans quickly please we haven't had any opportunity you have the right now and that's what brought me to Arizona like five hundred thousand of our veterans for our national security measures that are here\nI thought for it and make sure that the eight ten list hazard and then we fight for Luke air force base my opponent advocate into to look out for say well we're in harm's\nShe protesting are to entertain kids here and I tell you what they are not as qualifying enough there isn't what came out last week the report in that in two thousand three well she went on the radio he said it was okay for Americans\nTo join the Taliban have said\nThat we were hanging out at times we apologize to the veterans me for saying it isn't it true running out of time so he got to get a response we every five because she was out there that from our really\nGood for Martha and it was of course a non response you still have it you have a response\nYou know uh it was an on response will ah will will get the audio for you on that and she was asked about it after the debate as well\nAnd gave in non response to it and of course there you saw a Ted Simons are trying to um play the play the clock card on this um you know what\nThese guys can let it run a little longer if they've had to or if they wanted to they they absolutely could and it is a shame that we only have the one debate a between these two in this really monumental Senate race not only for we Arizona's but one of the few races\nUm that is probably getting more national attention than any other\nFunny thing I'll just a little inside thing about politics here in case you picked up on this or not\n[noise] yum Martha McSally pointed out that CNN good we got the response thanks and putting a Martha McSally pointed out that as CNN reported regarding her Taliban comments and I saw someone else say that as well [noise] I'm a funny thing it was Fox that first reported it\nBut you know I guess it comes off there's still that little bit of stigma you know there's still that little bit of stigma and that little bit of a\nStockholm syndrome where if it's CNN it's more important or at least maybe plays more importantly to the rest of the mainstream media I'm not a big deal just a little a background there\nAre so here thank you Anthony for the quick footwork er here is a Christian cinemas response\nIsn't it true running at\n\nA time so we got to get a response we every five 'cause she Holly's\nMartha has chosen to Ronald campaign like the one you're seeing right now we're assuming gaining on rent to kill us attacks\n\nOr she's marrying my pain is trying to cut cut cut and ... but the truth is that I always thought for Arizona and I had been proud to serve are sold in elected office for Thirteen Years Arizona now Neal and they now my record and I think an honor to fight for either on\nWhy that is trying to make the Senate campaign about me about what we now is that this campaign has about Africa\n[noise] yeah uh you know that that's fine just as much as ... as you can work and run the clock out on it and how she's she didn't she didn't say she always fought for our troops shouldn't say she's always fought\nFor American interests she said she was she's always fought for Arizona and that can be in any way she defined it as you well remember there was other audio of Kirsten Sinema are blaming about um forty to fifty percent of Arizona\nFor being crazy so it's Arizona as she sees it uh there is no defense that I can think of for what she said about it being just fine with her she joined the Taliban we had a pretty good spirited discussion with some callers I Believe there was a Michael who called yesterday\nTo challenge me or at least just challenge the notion of bringing up this comment from one cures and send them I was twenty seven years old I stand by that it is relevant I'm Glad ... brought it up and we can talk about any and all of that as well if you are further thoughts\nBut the point being that or what you say\nThat twenty seven uh may be different than what you say at thirty seven or what you think at top forty two which is the age of ... in cinema\nBut again it was a very extreme statement there is audio of it there is no defense of it and she has not said that she owns\nOwns that youthful indiscretion if she wants to call it that and it's changed her position on it it would be one thing to say [noise] back when I was in my twenties I held views that I look back on today and cannot believe I actually held\nAnd you are going to have to look at my whole record and realized that indeed I have moved far and beyond away from that kind of ridiculous and will do my best even fight it or should you elect\nMe there's any number of ways to own it and deal with it she has not which makes it all the more suspicious and the notion that she has changed and converted\nNot true not true or do the math and reading ... do say things that aren't true\nI Would never do that ray or not I would never say ... okay bring it to me they're not\nPaying for themselves are really going in ... I'm a conservative look heavy honest with each other okay for business people\nWho do you say okay so when you when you look at deficits who who who has a better record on deficits when the Democrats in Congress and one Brock Obama was president how we do on deficits how do we do our national debt\nYou know and that's where I struggle to because I thought George W. Bush was a good president\nObama left so far you told me that are a lifelong Republican and you have not named to me a Republican who use like on this issue made me wonder\nYou know what I I Love Reagan I thought George H was a great president mhm I really\nReally expensive and we asked how it was off the rails okay so give me the Republican you like I'm having a hard time accepting you Republican bona fetus I really am I Will tell you this um [noise] if you want to use the sermon on the mound\nAs your political voting guide you can there's a lot of other places in the Bible you can go to as well [noise]\nUm if you think um that Donald Trump can be a bully if you think he can be arrogant I won't argue the point I Will argue the point that he is a more of a bully or more arrogant than either the person he ran against two years ago and he's not on the ballot this year\nAnd I will also argue that he is less of a bully men Nancy Pelosi\nAnd Chuck Schumer look at what they did to Brett Kavanaugh\nThat is what bullies do now if you want to go to the sermon on them out I can read to\nBlessed are the other poor and spirit for theirs is the kingdom has blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted\nBlessed that are the ... for they will inherit the earth\nSo far there was no political guide and anything I've ... red blood or those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they won't be filled I think you can probably make arguments on righteousness blood or their merciful full they will be shown mercy who shows more mercy what party platform shows more ...\nTo the poor what party shows more mercy to getting people out of poverty\nBlessed are the pure in Hartford they will see God I think it's going to be a hard argument to make that uh you will find a Republican or Democrat ... Republican or Democrat who are appearing heart blessed that other peacemakers for they will be called children of God who's created more peace who opened up a war front and Libya\nWho opened up a war front in Yemen who has done something to get rid of ISIS who called ISIS junior varsity who has done something to stop the Assad regime who has done something to stop killing a North Korea\nBlessed are the peacemakers keep that in mind\nPlus there are those who are peers persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven I Do not look at November six as something that I can do to help bring closer the kingdom of heaven this is a traditionally Marxist notion that you can bring\nHeaven on earth\nTo know oneself as to disbelieve utopia to know the human condition\nIs to know that you cannot bring heaven on earth and every movement that has tried to do so has failed and rather instead [noise] raised help to the level of first in the countries that they ran\nYou want to tell me you're a Republican gimme a Republican you like it fits your very narrow criteria of reducing all deficits and all terrorists you won't find them [noise]\nFind me what real Republicans talk about Rick which are tax cuts which are social issues which is the defense of our military which does keep the peace and I'll give you a Ninety nine point nine percent of the Republican Party [noise] and I'll give you about five percent of the Democratic party I don't believe you I'm Sorry [noise]\n\nNinety sixty news sees\nWith Oreo con a secretary of fame icon Haley housing costs Saudis have
