program for me very least on state availability tender subject to change what I've noticed [noise]\nTo sit on the edge of the tub is when you talk to him and slash a hell of a I found that I um but there was an article\nThat came out um last couple of days in Arizona a Business Journal and I'm more people are moving in Maricopa County than anywhere in the United states Maricopa County some more people moved to the area than any county and the U.S during the during the past five years county ... two hundred and Twenty one thousand immigrants these are not\nMany illegal immigrants and these are people moving\nFrom other states I'm two or even other counties I guess ah to Maricopa County um two hundred Twenty one thousand people moved between two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen according to a new report from rent cafe\nThe volume was far by far the highest in the country the report shows nearly a hundred and fifty thousand people separated Maricopa County from the highest sight of immigration and that was a Wake County North Carolina\nI'm you know in ... and it's it's it's you know definitely you know in real estate sales and you see what's going on and you see all the building and whether it be commercial residential and you see everything\nYeah I get it I got it you know and here now now the opposite opposite is pretty interesting on the side of the spectrum\nLA county they saw three hundred and eighty one thousand people leave during the same time frame\nWhich is crazy so you know you've got LA county almost three hundred and eighty one thousand people leaving I'm kinda curious how many people came in and that will give you an adult the net result\nUm Santa Clara county in northern California was in the top ten for uh people leaving as well\nAnd one of the reasons is affordability um people in Southern California people in northern California they just can't afford to to buy a home they can't afford the rent anything I mean we've we've talked numbers on the show and you know toward blue in the face as far as what is the average sales price up in northern\nWell it's one point four million dollars in San Francisco the median price for a for a home just a standard home and that's nothing special\nYeah no it's not a crazy and and having said that you know it was it was home affordability was one of the top reasons why people move here I mean obviously climate or job opportunities that the you know the the chance for growth and whether it be through jobs or just in the city is growing and they're just so many more opportunities here but\nYou know the big thing was home affordability and you know there's been a lot of talk over the last couple of years about you know prices and we talk about this and just last week on the show we talked about the affordability um you know home affordability here in in America county and we and we go through these cities one by one matter of fact I've got some also reports here but\nUm you know the average cells price or the copper report that you had last week was to sixty I\nJumped to sixty four something like that yeah for finished so what would you rather have to sixty two sixty four in the in the metropolitan Maricopa County area sure or would you rather have a one point for all new and yeah and in San Francisco area now do you know some people might argue well yeah but the ... you know they they pay more up there\nThey don't pay that money yeah you're getting that much more like a one point the million dollar difference between the two I mean think about the you know the average price so phrase in San Francisco won't point for and here it's two hundred thousand dollars that's a one hundred what's on one point two million dollar difference basic I mean you shouldn't have been made straws\nIllegal in California you cannot have plastic straws and he worked at\nYes I actually I think that I think that's another\n... so to me to migrate to America and yeah because who wants to drink out of a ... they get soft and they get machine they don't you know that's all out to be a big factor\nAnd so maybe one of the other reasons of Maricopa County is is so huge and growth is we allow straw straws added laid it out back to that and so yeah Maricopa County is obviously growing this is something we experienced um\nYou know back in the sixties and seventies and then again in the nineties and then the early to thousands and here we are back again you know there's a reason we all live here I've lived here my whole life I'm not going anywhere and there's a reason I'm not going anywhere I mean why would I Want\nTo go and you mentioned trying to live in Toledo knowing nothing against Toledo but I mean with everything that we have going on here in in in Arizona [noise] it would be really tough to go yeah I mean I live in ... I just hate picking on Toledo but when you compare to Arizona it's a it's the ugly stepchild\nIt is and it's and even some more desirable places you know don't even have ... we had an officer you know that's crazy so\nIn in keeping in in the the you know the the dean of talking prices I put I pulled a couple of all to report so\nUm let's give you an idea of what prices are like in the two largest metropolitan cities of America and that's a good comparison you didn't actually feeling in may so I Need to make the Phoenix one point whatever million one point five million what we have similar to the United states Mesa\nIt's like seven hundred thousand plus I think if I'm not mistaken I mean there's that's a major city in other places not and that's just one of our suburbs so let's talk about Phoenix says the report says this is real time southeastern right these are these reports that I pulled up today\nPhoenix the single family I'm a median ... three thirty nine nine guy compared to one point ... says if you are that's the only a hundred and Seventy seven dollars a square foot the average data marketing eighty days\nUm the price increase of four percent so we saw four percent appreciation says Phoenix metro and this is not just specific area code I mean since the codes\nCertain ZIP codes and things maybe hire maybe a little bit lower um the most expensive home that sold in Phoenix or over the last two months of twelve million nine hundred and fifty okay that we're getting up to San Francisco standard drink elite expensive was only Seventy five thousand pretty pretty big difference\nOne of the things that I'm noticing when I pull these all these reports is that the market action index which is which tells you if there's fires marketed as a seller's market\nThey actually break it down into you know strong seller's market or sleight or whatever right now I'm Phoenix the flight sellers advantage\nYeah and I used to be strong strong strong strong every money's like all the\nSilt act like in fact now Mesa and the median sales price list price on me says three Fifteen a high price per square for one sixty one square foot days are markets sixty two so homes are selling a little bit quicker a little bit less expensive\nUm six percent appreciation rate ah over there uh the end of ... when you get through the industry obviously the size of Phoenix is much larger only thirty six hundred and forty six home mhm for sale in metro Phoenix and may so there's only twelve hundred and thirty seven inventory again the problem but we are seeing some inventory increases\nUm and the and the market index over there they strong seller's market\nAnd why I think one of the reasons obviously was only sixty two days on marketing a little bit more affordability as far as that's concerned so when you take the two largest metropolitan areas in Maricopa County and you look at these sales prices you know the golden number that we say\nFor a sales prices concern where properties don't stay on the market very long at all is three hundred thousand dollars a month well Phoenix is only three thirty nine nine average was pricing masons only three Fifteen so the average list price and the two largest metropolitan areas of Maricopa County are just above that golden number one yeah that's awesome you know\nAnd so I'm a ... that remains to the you know why there's so many people migrating here at home affordability is definitely\nA you know here now and it's going to be in the picture in the future 'cause you know at six percent appreciation and four percent appreciation were not climbing to the west\nFor a range anytime soon exactly exactly and we are still feathering the throw absolutely so the real estate\nMarket in the Phoenix area right now and going forward is is going to be strong it's going to be very strong even with rates picking up a little bit over the last twelve months it's still very strong because you can still get high for as low ... which is still a historically low rate when you look at time after time that's for sure\nNow talking about interest rates are loans I found a very interesting article I'll let you go in and talk about this one well\nThe average psycho score or what you know this is the average cycle credit score how does your ...\nWell the average psycho score reached a basically what they're saying is the average is a seminal for seven hundred and four or five goes for the average up four points from the previous year according to the semi annual report released in late September the steady improvement in credits quality singles American consumer credit and financial health as strong\nAs the Federal Reserve rate hikes make borrowing more expensive so that's good news I mean we're up to seven for is the average psychological\nAverage psycho score yeah and here's the thing is that there there was a graph um went back to two thousand eight and it showed the average bike was two thousand um ate a on 'til now and in two thousand nine the we bottomed out in the average cycle\nScore ... six eighty six I yeah I think that he said yeah I Would have thought much lower to be honest with you yeah you know but the average psycho score in October of two thousand nine with six eighty six hours were bottomed out and it's taken all the way to now to get up to seven and four you know\nAnd just let people know kind of an arranged for cycle scores are lower FICA scores you're going to be in the five fifties and you'll have a super a plus credit would be above been eight hundred psycho score so a seminal for her that she you know\nOne of the loan officers dream pro after what actually is I mean yeah you get\nYou know six Seventy six eighty six Ninety seven seminal for you know the average a lot of loan officers like yep you're gold and yeah that's that's good uh what they were one of the things they mentioned the article it says a ... a hundred ... generally considered exceptional\nThat six Seventy enough range is considered good to exceptional and the six sixty nine or below is considered fair or poor and you know here's the thing there's a lot of um loans that allows cycle scores down to I think five Seventy\nFA chase them five eighty something somewhere in that neighborhood so you don't have to have that\nWonderful seminal for you know your average or eight hundred cycles or even six eighty or six Seventy or whatever you you know here's the thing there's a lot of people out there whether it's their fault or not they're Franco\nScores you just don't add up to I mean it's you for whatever reason that doesn't mean you shouldn't be buying a home absolutely you know because even if you were at let's say a ... uh five Seventy and you want to get to maybe six twenty or something like that you argue loan officer deaths that we have on the ... and our guest today can do that\nExactly they're invested in getting people are into their homes as much as we are and they love that when we can come to them and say hey thanks\nHelping you with this lone bits of the client that was turned down three times what made it\nPossible so okay so ... you mean example of let's say you've had somebody who might have been turned down a two or three different places why would they be turned down at other places and you guys give him a gaffe give us like somebody they were\nSo frequently it's a knowledge gap\nSo maybe somehow lows aren't as well informed about what's going on or they don't pay attention to new bulletins or new guidelines or new in protest or interpretations of the same guideline\nAnd if they're not educating themselves constantly then they're going to miss those opportunities and then sometimes are those that don't maybe think outside the box and say okay let's talk about your scenario let's figure out a way to do it knowing that other products exist maybe sometimes out a outside qualifying mortgages important polio products or other ways of structuring the deal to get it done\nAnd it's a matter of education or it's a matter of experience or a matter of having the team behind you that knows about certain products or certain ways to get a deal done that other folks aren't thinking\nSo so if somebody comes to you and says hey we're thinking about buying a house and my cousin just got their license to be a mortgage loan officer or what we think we're going to go with them that might not be the best route for them right\nUnfortunately not another cousin might be a great person and maybe in a after some time there are a great loan officer as well but if you think that all loan officers are created equal then you were sorely mistaken at the same thing for realtors\nAnd I don't ever remember ever doing a slam dunk transaction with women being being a loan officer every deal even the ones do you think we're going to be the easy ones there's always something the jumps up and gets you so having an experience loan officer there is huge whether you are doing this for the first time\nFor the time it's huge and not only does it make a difference sometimes between qualifying and not qualifying a client\nBut also the experience with that climate houses you know as we mentioned it to stress can be stressful experience and if you have somebody who's thumbing their way through it and trying to figure it out as they go\nThat's only going to add to the pain and suffering the client I'm so sometimes I'll tell people you know please go to my website read my reviews after you see not coming back and see if you still think it makes sense and I'm confident because I Know that we take great care of our clients so\nOne of the things that you know what's in your body you have a degree in economics\nSo looking at the current economic climate that we're in right now with the stock market doing what it's done recently just the way it's affecting the the the the the bond market you know all that and taking a look at the real estate market do you think that you know in the foreseeable future we're still okay we're still strong and things are still looking good\nYes I think so I'm there too\nI Would say variables that I'm looking at when people ask me now is a good time to buy one is where rates are and one is where we expect values to be say a year from now\nSo as you mentioned even though we're starting to see inventory come up a little bit I think on that same ground for more than we're a to point seven two point eight months of him in that in the low number very law or for people who aren't in the industry that's a low number and then in another year if we're at say a ready to five percent now we're probably at five point seven five that makes a big difference and affordability and forcing\nPower so excellent knowing that she had so much we're going to take a break protecting no governor he is the one officer with American furniture that work

loan officer is American financial networks and ... you know one of the things you take pride in his you know you take time to educate the borrowers throughout the whole entire loan process and and I bring\nThat up and I I Want to hear what you do with your clients but I bring that up because you know they're sitting at the closing table like I have for the last thirty five years\nYou know I don't mind answering people's questions but the one thing that really and and I I actually love educating people as well that's why I was instructor for so on but the thing that I despise is when they're asking me some of the most remedial\nExactly so it'd be a drag you should have been addressed up front it should have those question should have been posed loan officer and if they're asking me they've probably tried to ask somebody throw up a lot of problems and they didn't get the answers to re election they wanna show yeah so what is it that you do to help educate people\nSure I think part of it is just almost as you mentioned last segment is that this is the first time somebody's doing it for the first time they've done it in seven eight years and it's going to be very different from the last time most likely and walking somebody through it helps them feel comfortable with the process\nIt sets it up nicely when I'm asking for documentation that they already know why I'm asking for it up so they already know to expect it and then when I call them and say hey this is the next step they've already heard about the next step exactly do they already know for me to see what's going to look like they know why I'm asking for certain pieces of information during the application process\nThey know that when we lock that rate they're going to get some pieces of paper work they know that once belonged gets conditional you approve and I'm going to come back and have a smaller list of items that I Need\nAnd they're going to know then that from that point on its cleaning up the final details getting them ready to sign and then when they get these\nUm this is something again that they need to be educated on it feel better about it to understand why I'm asking for it and to make the whole process moves and it's in partnership also with your realtor partners who are going to be doing the same thing and let letting them know hey this is very normal this is a normal things is how the sequence of events goes and this is why we need it\nUm and it makes the process enjoyable for the bar or\nWell I we have an open letter that goes out to our buyers and sellers and all transactions and and there's quite a few times where all have the buyer a you know they'll fill it out and they'll email back or they'll say hey I'm sending it back to you what do I do next and he said well basically with us You're you're done until we get closer to the end they said but I say this every single time\nIn in he encourages us and they encourage us\nTo continue to learn and become better practitioners and the better practitioners we are the better we serve our clients and that's really what it's all about so we we're continually learning not just you know kind of global you know statistics and here's how you read a contract we all should do that any way\nBut it's really you know gets down to the nitty gritty how do we come become better practitioners and how can we best serve our clients and and you know that the focus on that is is paramount in the sharing among agents is\nTremendous I mean you know you can go you can also need to go to document for this do you have ... do you ever been up for this and they share it without question without you know there's there's not there's none of that like courting of information it's all open book and that has made a parents from the first time\nUh you you talked to Brenner Stephanie it's open book we're here to share where to learn we're here to get better as as practitioners and his people\nThat's awesome yeah 'cause you could definitely get stuck in your way and youth you assume some things right way to do it and then if you were open to\nHearing other ways to do it I mean it's you know having a um what's the word I'm looking for [noise] um just your your God I Can't even think of the word and help you out of jail or it could help me out right now\nThere are lots of ... sometime it just comes down to philosophy I mean there's the nuts and bolts and how you do a deal but sometimes just to be hearing other people's philosophies on how they work with their clients and their philosophy and judge Chavez a change in philosophy sometimes just phenomenal\nWill and being and being open to even hearing others philosophy you know there's a lot of ego and the reason you know a a a you know there's ... there's not just one way to sell real do some people think so I just you know in in ... and it's you know you you you do get in your own head because you're running your own little micro business and you're\nA you know you're doing it your way and you're you're finding success doing it your way and so it's easy to get in your in your right and a close yourself to other people's opinions ideas philosophies\nUm and uh you know that that kind of where I found myself before I made the move you know I kind of um a plateaued for a year or two in my business I was getting bored with it I didn't know what the next generation was\nAnd then I was introduced to Bryan sat down and had a cup of coffee with them um talk to my wife and she was just like the look in your eyes and you know the the fire that I'm seeing right now she's like you got to go it's a business what you've been this or you've been missing out to go and\nUm you know I kind of went over to the brokerage with a with the kind of stripped down like OK guys\nFeel me what are we going to do what what are you out for me and just open myself up to uh to the culture to the to the ideas to the philosophy to the to the education and it's been a you know I've ... new book after ... ... you know in our meetings are discussions are\nAre ... you know monthly educational a series we have multiple educational series throughout the month and it's just like furious notes in and that's something that I I just hadn't done\nA and one of the aspects and strength so you bring to the professional being a real estate agent is that you also have a little history and law\nUh and I think we talked a little bit about that the break but uh being able to you you did go to law school there to Arizona State University You're not a practicing attorney so given any legal advice but how does the laws that background help you with the buyers and sellers yeah you\nKnow the having a law degree um\nUh it's taught me way of thinking you know really it it it teaches you how to look at\nUm the totality of of of you know circumstances in front of your pick out some risks I and and risk ... is a term that you do you hear a lot in in law school and in the the practice of law\nIn in real estate in the in the course of a transaction from the second you interact with a client or to even after the the um the keys or an ... left hand or whatever the the the gates maybe there's the the entire process is fraught with risk\nIn each each client interaction has its own set of risk and beanie having a law degree his taught me how to look at the totality of the circumstance and hopefully sniff out risk\nUm before before really uh really fester into something worse than\nThan uh than it is ... ... I mean I Know exactly what you're talking about because we're sitting behind the desk working escrow for all these years you know I tell jokingly I said I'm not an attorney I just want to work because we're put in that situation in escrow to look at those things and I've had a lot of agents and to this day I have a lot of agents who lean on me for my my advice\nAnd they'll say hey what about this I say well yeah you can do that however you need to worry about this or\nAnd then there's some things that they think are so far outside of the box that scare the crap out of my going you know actually yes that's the best thing to do because we've\nSitting in our see we've seen all the you know when you you know there's that old saying is if you are there to every action there's an equal and opposite reaction we've seen all those actions and we've seen all those equal and opposite reaction\nAnd we've seen where something might sound risky but in fact it's actually very tight then we've seen things were a lot of people were like oh yeah we can just do this I'm like whoa wait a minute you might not want to do this and this is why and they're like oh my God I'm Glad to God I called you because\nYou're right it's this is not an upset does my whole career real estate is not black and white it's one of those grays things I've ever seen and so because of that you're right it is fraught with risk\nThat you know that that grade you talk about\nUm you know when you there are a lot of type ... and in in this business but they're Taipei is a kind of have a little engineering twist on them right they they want everything in a box they want everything nice and pretty in this business is not like the real or not fit in uh there's not a tremendous amount of ... and in if it did that'd be one big by the end it'd be dirty and you know\nIt it would it would not be a pretty box and that's that gray you you have to become comfortable living in our world and you've got to be able to to push and pull in there and and make the best at it\nWhen you somebody ask your question and asked me a question the first thing I Do is start thinking about all the things that can go wrong a hundred percent because when they start you know it's not like\nCan we do this I don't look at it and go yes I look at it go okay what's wrong with this yep and if I Can't find anything wrong with it searching all that experience that I got in that you're talking about are the way our minds work and none of my ... okay yeah with work\nYou know but I'm thinking I'm trying to pull all this information or I might even lean on somebody in our company and say hey\nI think I've seen this before but yeah you know when they come from it but you're right it's how it's you know it's kind of like you know when some you speak to you talk to somebody from another country and say hey do you think in your language or do you think an English it's the same thing with us when we look at it\nThinking of the moment we see\nAbsolutely drawn on you know ... ... ... ... experience in learning through each\nDeal and transaction inclined interaction that you get you know if you're not learning in this business whether it's you know a ... a year as a as a real estate agent in as an escrow officer as a lender if you're not learning if you're not actively trying to learn if you're not talking away lessons if you're not saying\nWow that that was crazy I've never seen that or or my goodness a that was a weird one I'm going to talk this went away and drawn out again are absolutely or you're not doing yourself any favors you're not doing your you know your clients and your partner's any and after thirty five years in this business I'm Still learning all the time and and that that's what makes you ... can you continue to do it\nI think you have to because I Want you want your cold wind it to this industry I learned that way back when once your mind is interesting you might as well just get out because it's all you know we would always move and it's always you\nKnow and it operates in that area and Hans ... living in the Greg hey you're one of the things that you really probably yourself on is the fact that you put your clients always put your class first and the ... but we have a lot of agents ... my you know but that's what I always use but my ... give us an example and Rick expound on\nThat yeah you know ... every interaction the have you know when the phone call rings or\nOr get a text message from someone or hey you know we call we call my friend or you know thinking about buying I gave me your number or whatever I mean\nTo me it's it's it's exciting because it's like what's behind the door and you know what are they ... how can I help because you know it's fun you get to build it from from from the from the bottom up and help people realize you know their dreams when they're buying their\nThey're buying a great house that they can and vision living in when they're selling their oftentimes moving on to something else and you know putting putting the claim first sounds like a you know every agent while I'm being you know putting that either but I'm a really to me\nUh I Try to treat people um eh put them in front of my own needs put them in front of my family's needs and make sure that if I Do right by them I I Want them to think of only me forever like how he he\nIs a good guy he shot a straight he never lie to us he protected us and we're\nNever ever going to go anywhere and if every one of your ... your plants could walk away feeling like that you would never I mean you have business forever because of the roof robust us it's just phenomenal invaded them right they're going to come back a hundred percent Ninety percent of my\nBusiness is referral anyway when I when I said at the closing table and people ask me questions and you know sometimes I might say you might not like carrying this but I'm going to tell you step by step what's gonna happen next\nAnd they just sit back and I tell them and they're like oh God thank you so much because nobody's told me really what it's going to happen next it's and and I just say look I just want to be honest this is what's gonna happen here we're going to go and this was and we hope and if everything goes as planned and usually does we will be recording are closing whatever but they appreciate the honesty they appreciate the transparency\nHonesty transparency clarity laying it out for them you know I I I my goal is to is to make sure my clients never call me with questions do I succeed not a hundred percent of the time you know it's hard to be so formulaic in a world that gray and our business that kind of amorphous and moving around constantly to be in front of every\nCentral question but at least trying to get on front of an engineering major and he can get out in front of you can you you certainly can and and I and I do my best and and it's something I've continued to build on but that too is something we're clients\nEverybody here and you're there and\nContinue with the show we can actually start to show [noise]\nI haven't spoken about the show me the issue [noise]\nWanted to see how it played out [noise]\nTo be is the man who was murdered [noise]\nBased on anything anybody can imagine it's indefensible morally indefensible crime was committed against them and [noise]\nThere's a lot about the man that I don't know I don't know what his views where he's portrayed as a liberal in Saudi Arabia against an autocratic regime but they're all the reports about him but no matter what his views that this is obviously not something we can morally accept\nThe question that looms larger than that however is why is there so much attention being paid here dissidents or regime opponents in the middle east are routinely murdered\n...\n... it's one of the great puzzles of life but I think I have an answer to this one but it is often a puzzle as to why something dominates the news and something else doesn't\nThe Saudi or the Saudi regime and got rid of someone wanted to get rid of\nAnd now in the year twenty Eighteen this is international\nNews to the extent that it is an ongoing daily story\n\nGiven how many people who who oppose Assad get tortured to death\nOr or\nIn the Egyptian regime or in other off African regimes other Arab countries of Muslim countries they have many people have been tortured to death in Iran can you name one\nSo why why is this so much of a fixation\nThe question is not whether or not we accept what happened and\nThe question is why is there a fixation on this man well one reason as you wrote columns for the Washington Post so he has a connection to the west and specifically to the United states and the other is that we have\nPhotographic data with regard\nTo I mean there man walks into a consulate and never walk south it's pretty damning then we have that on video we have on video of their men entering\nAnd we have the information about those men entering turkey and then leaving turkey so everything is obvious\nWhy the Saudi regime or elements of the Saudi regime would want to get rid of this man that's a puzzle to me\nDid you ever hear of this guy ah I'm I immersed myself in world affairs and I've ever heard of the guy\nAnd and and by the way and if you read the column so they're not exactly a sin to leaving or revealing or or anything I mean it's the Washington Post on to the Saudi ride around a lot to understand that fight I Wish they had an Iranian writer\nWho was who was a dissident what's the guy would be a dead on arrival deal way so here's my theory as to why there is such preoccupation with this man\nAnd there are two reasons in my opinion one is Saudi Arabia is an ally of the United states and\nThe the media are far more preoccupied with the bad things that allies do than the bad things that enemies to\nYeah you might want to ask why the call I don't know fully this is a physicist now speculation\n\nThey would I think they would argue we we have influence on allies we don't have influence on enemies\nTherefore\nOn those that we can influence we should try to have some influence that's the most noble read of the preoccupation with the deprivation of allies as opposed to the deprivation of enemies\nRight there's ... there's nothing on the dissidents in Iran and when Iran did in fact have an uprising during the\nDuring the Obama administration as he essentially said nothing and the ... that was defended by the entire liberal slash left media because it was brought Cole bomber\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is\nIt you have a moral sense and it's very important thing for a lot of people think well of themselves and we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention\nSomething terrible that they're an ally of the United states is the second reason\nIs that he's not only an ally of the Saudi regime was not only in LA of the United states an ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left does not Kim Jong un and it is about the Ayatollah Khomeini me\nA news not the end is not Bashar al Assad's diet is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media ... world's media run by the left and the left tapes him more than any of them and if she has a friend the friend is hated\n\nThose are the two reasons so what are we supposed to do here is the question on the table what are we supposed to do we can't deny and it's because it's it would be a lawyer and you can tell lies kept an eye on what the Saudi regime did did it doesn't go up all the way to the crown prince we don't know\nBut it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently who are\nEngaged in this murder so what are we supposed to do [noise] cancel a hundred billion dollars what what is this something that they ever ordered in in ... five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of ... that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well listen morale up being more important than jobs to which the answer is what is ... ... yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there are two big cavity up here one is jobs is a moral issue\nIt's not it's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can ... an able tens of thousands of Americans to work\nBut if ... murder is murder I I I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of moral bad that's a very big component of my moral thinking\nBut the a lot of save the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two most important if you really want to talk more real than the greatest moral good right now might be in the world the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside if its borders\nIt's it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the ... the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that light a more decent place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater goods the most obvious example being a man of didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nGet that figure because it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that he was slaughtering people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works not the way we imagine we allowed Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shark to step down in Iraq\nThe murder of cars showcase despicable\nIn life the question is not only correctly labeling bad\nAs bad acts it's what do you do about them afterwards\n[laughter]\nThat's that's the way it works on ... in the real world the real world is not pleasant and then the real world you will fight evil with people who are morally\nTroubled themselves and in\nThis case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nAlright\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings for Democrats take control of the Senate Dianne Feinstein his so deteriorated but as a
