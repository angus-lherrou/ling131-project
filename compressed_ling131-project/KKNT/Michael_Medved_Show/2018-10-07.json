specialist was save money one have you ever asked yourself\nWhat's the purpose of money when I asked my list there's what's the purpose of\nMoney I get all kinds of answers one of my listeners answered\nBy telling me that he wanted his money to grow is that the purpose of money to grow everyone wants to money to grow just like nobody wants to lose their money\nBut growth is just a function of money not a purpose I'm going to let you in on a big secret I'm going to tell you the purpose of money and I promise that you've never heard anybody tell you like this before I Do now it'd be a great time to call and get your free copy of our save money buck and save money information kit\nIf you want your money to grow why not have it grow with a guaranteed rate of up to seven percent compounded for a lifetime of income that you cannot outlive call now and a four four three seven one safe again\nThat's paid for for three seven one seven to three three\n[noise] so what is the purpose of money it's very simple yet profound if you understand what I'm about to explain you can live out your retirement with way less stress more confidence and more comfort than you ever thought possible\nThere's actually two purposes for money only to no more no less\nBut first purpose is life and the second purpose is yeah\nI bet you've never heard of that way before I'm sure everyone you listen to or ticket advice from his always tried to tell you about growing your money which ever told you about the purpose of money so what does that mean a purpose for life for a purpose for death\nWhen I say that one purpose for money is life I mean you're going to use that money while you're alive\nIn our business we call that income\nNo matter how you look at it if you spend the money during your lifetime you're taking income from that money for the purpose of life\nWhen I say that another purpose for money is death that means you're planning on leaving that money behind we call that a legacy in other words you're going to pass the money on your heirs after you're gone\nIt's critical that your financial planner understands the importance of creating strategies for both the purpose of life and death\nSome strategies work better for income and others work better for legacy the ideal strategy though allows you to maximize your income now while protecting your legacy just in case you don't live as long as you hope to\nThat's why you should call me now and ate for for three seven one save that's eight four four three seven one seven to three three we specialize in no market strategies they'll provide you with the maximum benefit for life or death\nYou can call now are needed a week they pick up a copy of our free hundred plus page safe money book it's over a hundred pages of everything your broker doesn't want you to know\nCall it for for three seven one safe that's eight four four three seven one seven to three three\nSo like I said there are only two purposes for money spending the money while you're alive or leaving the money to those left behind by far the most significant purpose of money is income\nIt's the one thing not to leave money to your beneficiaries\nBut it's a disaster if you outlive your money in fact studies show that outliving retirement money is actually more feared than death for many people\nNow is the purpose of your money is life there are only two plans for that purpose once called the plan for death than the others called the plan for life if you have a broker a financial planner that isn't an expert in plans for life meaning guaranteed income for life then I'm certain you're on a plan for ...\nWhat is a plan for death when it comes to your retirement income well here it is you save up your money you invested in something that provides a hypothetical non guaranteed ready to return it has market risk\nOr it's a short term guaranteed ready to return in other words you have no guarantee for a long term growth you might hope for seven percent compound a growth but after fees market downturns raid aspirations and so forth you have no idea what kind of return you're going to get\nIn fact you don't even know if you're going to get any return because the next two thousand eight market draw might be just around the corner\nTraditional planning says you you save up your money hoping that grows and then at some point in time he decided to retire and you start to draw income from those accounts how much do you draw though four percent three percent or do you just drop the amount you need and hope for the best\nThe problem with this plan is that your hypothetical growth is combined with an arbitrary span down that'd be retirement accounts and you have no idea if the plan is going to work because you don't know how long you're going to live\nAnd you don't know when the market will have another correction if you die sooner than you thought you spent two little if you live longer than you thought you'd probably run out of money before you die in order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to plan on dying by a certain age what fun is that\nThat's what I recall that kind of plan a plan for death\nYou want to plan for dying or plan for a living in a second I'm going to tell you about a plan for life and if you want to find out specifically how no market risk plan for life would apply to your retirement call me right now\nAnd I can show you a better way to live\nA way towards a lifetime income account that isn't wasted away by fees or market declines that comes with a

a weather spotter for the unit yeah there there was a much a spot though yeah if you look at it was just rang the training\nFlooding into whether spotters we're looking for more of the stuff that causes tons of damage I you know if I did see some flash flooding or if I did see some flooding I Would call that end but I mean it was just a steady rain for one day and a half almost two days started kinda Sunday night into Monday when we needed alley we needed badly but\nYou know after the remnants of that hurricane or Rosa and tropical storm Rosa came through you know what's coming in behind it is some beautiful weather uh we get some beautiful whether it's in the eighties and we're supposed to be seed some temperatures in the seventies which means you know hey fall has arrived actually officially a little earlier than normal here in Arizona\nNow this is all the pain this is this is what you you ... your struggle through the summers for these next six months because you know October through march now is just heaven and this is a great time to call your family back east when they're skipping their driveway and and uh you know and rub it in a little bit\nOh absolutely absolutely and and and you know for all those agents out there who are who are working with buyers are wanted to start working with fires but they were like you know it's just a little too hot let's wait till it cools off a little bit and boom here you go to how is the time to do it so now you can get out in the afternoons and it's not too hot and you can\nSpend you know days on end looking just you know\nI'm not that kind of thing and it and it was beautiful so this is you know that this time of year a time of year is actually one of the best time to go out looking because\nYou know there's a lot of mitigating factors and why people want to to buy now during the ... possibly want to get something before the end of the year so they can get a little tax write off for next year before the holidays getting the more the holidays ... yeah 'cause I mean if you get under contract now you can get in before Thanksgiving obviously before Christmas\nBut even you know through October and into November you can get in before\nYou know the the the Christmas Holiday season so um it's always cool to maybe ... you know spend the holidays in your new home and and again you get to take care of you know take advantage of some of those tax breaks you know for a few months left in this year um I ran across an article I thought it was a very interesting\nIt was on the national association of realtors a website and it's you know five reasons that clients should a house on a in the fall and the fall um and I and it would it's it's very true because it's\nYou know in the in the last few years because of our lack of inventory it's been you know very strong seller's market in the markets slowly starting to turn towards\nYou know still a a a seller's market but not nearly as strong one and we're starting to see a shift towards maybe by her side and\nAnd this time of year you know things do get a little quieter even though I think it's one of the best times to buy with a lot of people haven't got that message but um you know so here's the reasons why it is a great time\nTo go out and look for home you know during the fall season I'm number one and we don't keep in mind this is a national are very much so but on the number one is less focused on landscaping last spring and summer spring green grass implants life\nForm I actually allow buyers to concentrate on the condition of the homes exterior better viewing houses in the fall you can spot exterior flaws and even landscaping problems setting up and\nTo you know to deal with those issues before you buy a house you know I we don't really see you know because of our warm weather even into the winter months lot of times you know\nAnd the landscaping still looks the same ... may maybe in the summer is the best time when you're ... everything's dead\nYou know to hide it works completely different but still a good point for it is a good point and the other forty nine state and number two the\nPressure's off there's less competition from other buyers as we've discussed her press for deadline such as the start of the school year means stress ... so yeah I mean you've got less buyers you know in in the market uh agents have more time well you know if there's less buyers in the market and and they're not working with as many clients than the agents have a little bit more time\nTo focus on on those particular buyers or even those particular sellers\nI'm Better deals and we've already started to see some of that can we've seen I think I saw a um a stat recently where a fourteen percent of all listings on in our less actually saw price reductions yeah in the month of August I there was a month of August or September I Can't remember which one\nAnd that's because you know there's a lot of um you know sellers\nThat think they can get the sky's the limit or for their list there on the seller's market we get a list of what every one next thing you know there's priced reduction yes and in some cases there are some agents out there that I think\nI'm a you know overall that that's a great strategy it's not a great stat strategy and maybe in particular cases but overall it's not a great strategy to listen to hear hoping you get that offer and then after you know there are some people that are scheduled after ten days we'll do a five thousand dollar dropped him or days in another five\nThat's not really the greatest drying up you know just price it right the offer ... agree you know\nA center are getting less buyers out there that some of these sellers might be\nYou know it's like hey we need to get this household so they might be willing to take a a little bit of a dip in in the actual eh I accepted sales price\nAnd then I'll be the number five because there are less buyers that there there's fewer bidding wars you know we've seen over the last few years on multiple offers if you're in that three hundred thousand dollar price range and blow\nYou know it's a multiple offers situation almost one hundred percent of the time and so again with with me to the human tore going up because you have less buyers out there are just you know organic lead in Detroit goes up\nIf you were bidding war so this is obviously you know\nIt's funny how we always know that the spring is always going to be super busy you know and everybody subscribes to that sort of course the spring gets busy and then it kind of trickled into the summer a little bit and we see a bit of a dip\nI'm going into the fall where you know in Arizona there really shouldn't be season it really shouldn't be seasonal you should be able to look for a home where they'll be in the middle of December of the middle of July [noise]\nUm but it does happen so you know these these principles do apply you know even to Arizona\n[noise] yeah and I know you're one of the other articles that you had pulled up and I I think I'm going to kind of let you cover the spin to lending tree rebuilds the cities that have the largest or biggest houses in America which is kind of interest\nYou know when it first of all this article I thought you know again they're just going to cover you know all these big huge homes you know but what this is saying is this is the top forty seven cities in the United states and we're not going to go through a forty cetera so don't worry about that um but the the top forty seven cities as far as\nThe the average size homes and I thought this was quite interesting because\nYou know I you know what are what are you getting other cities you know as far as you know maybe ... obviously looking at them you you see a certain elevation but it's like you know if you were in San jose California what's you know what kind of what five home can you get for the dollar that you're spending or Memphis, Tennessee or whatever the case and\nSo these are the the uh forty five largest cities\nAs far as the um medium sized home Howard sites on the average size estimated sales price and then the price per square foot which I thought was quite interesting so we'll just go to the top ten I'm number tendons Orlando, Florida the average size home there is Seventeen hundred and fifty eight square feet mhm ah average prices to twenty eight with a\nPrice per square foot of one hundred and thirty dollars Boston Seventeen hundred and sixty Seventy feet a four fifty seven sales price to fifty nine per square foot Raleigh North Carolina Seventeen Ninety five average sales price to Fifteen one ... square foot I'm now number\nHere we are Phoenix Eighteen hundred and thirty two square feet is the average size home in the Phoenix metropolitan area which I got to be honest with you I find that uh I I I didn't realize they were that day\nYeah I uh well I guess if you average out the whole Phoenix metro that seems a little larger ... okay well I mean you're looking you know take central Phoenix had allowed historic districts are nine hundred square foot house as well\nBut even even if you go out to homes that were built in the early seventies and late sixties and you may be ... to the hundreds or yeah you're talking about Fifteen sixteen Seventeen hundred square feet maybe but Eighteen hundred square feet average sales price to fifty five one thirty nine a square foot Vegas right above us eight and thirty five square feet\nTo sixty two one forty three per square for very similar to them or if you look at you know Phoenix in Vegas I mean we have similar um demographics our weather's very similar and here you're are you in our homes our cells pricing price were score for a very similar Austin, Texas Eighteen sixty one per square foot\nTwo eighty three sales price one fifty to as a a square foot Dallas Eighteen hundred and sixty two square feet to Seventeen sales price one Seventeen square foot Washington DC which I thought this was a cause a lot of the older cities have smaller square footage ah\nI'm Nineteen oh wait a out yeah I thought that was also one full size averages yeah for forty six sales price where the two thirty four square foot number to Atlanta Nineteen hundred and fourteen square feet one Ninety six average sale price one hundred and two dollars a square foot much more affordable Lana\nAnd then Houston, Texas at Nineteen hundred and fifty two square feet one Ninety six sales price at a hundred dollars a square foot so if you take a look at you know\nI'm you know when when people talk about affordability there's still a lot of afford to do the higher than the United states obviously Washington DC at two thirty four square foot or Boston or two fifty nine square foot might have more higher higher priced homes but there is a big houses\nAnd you had mentioned earlier or you're just throwing it out there San jose California is Seventeen are there a median square footage is one thousand seven hundred in Lebanon and their median a estimated sell spices one point one million\nSo yeah that's a price for sure for six hundred and\nNinety three dollars price for sure if I just wanted number forty five or forty Troy\nAverage average size Thirteen hundred square feet yup hundred and forty dollars a hundred and forty thousand dollars sales price that I went oh five square\nFor us or if I have felt real quickly I Want to talk about something away before we run out of time so we went to the Michael ... Michael horror from the prompt for reports that anybody in Arizona real estate understands that the proper reports or like our Bible gives us all of our stats up to date\n[noise] yeah and that's the challenge question especially with you know home prices going up you guys talked about the average square for a per square foot and you know Phoenix is getting higher and higher and home prices do continue to appreciate hopefully\nYou know the market is softening a bit just to get more into a normal market there's not as much and you know multiple offers situations\nAnd I am Eli I like to call it the normalization of the real estate market because that's what we're doing is we're getting back to normal market now keep in mind to with this volatility with especially yesterday with the rates\nYou know we didn't jump to like six Seventy percent you know we might have jumped a quarter an exact something today we do a lot for one day that's the thing is when you have that big of a jump in one day you might see a quarter of a jump over two or three or four week period which is a lot easier to\nDrain digest but when you have it over a one day period but at the same time the market could easily over the next day or two come right back\nIt it could um but we're we are kind of in a territory it's a new territory we've hit the highest rates that we've hit in the last seven years and there's really no\nForecast that that's going to slow down those there's real for caffeine is going to get on the holiday 'cause he's so it's it's definitely in and appreciating cycle\nThat's I think people need to mentally get to a point it's like what we're gonna we're gonna probably eventually subtle into oh five to five and a half somewhere over there and the next twelve month and just get used to it\nYet and it's the newer buyers um you know the rates aren't as much of a shock to them it's the people that are selling terrifying because if\nYou saw in a house with like a ... point seven and my interest rate\nIf they financed in two thousand two thousand twelve you know or even in right before the election two thousand uh what was at fourteen or Fifteen um rates were in the last three yeah and I see people right now with rage and that the reason you quote him you know higher than that they're like\nWhoa I heard on the news ... everything's\nDelayed on the news anyway a ... but you know what a lot of this and I think we're going to start seeing the re emergence of a it's still out there a year and a three one arm's comeback to buy one arms of seven on arms and historically speaking most people what refinance and in a less and so\nWe have that and we actually have it's a really cool product it's a two percent by down so you can do a ... year fixed in let's say you know at a higher rate and let's just I'm not going to quote ... for example purposes yeah you can if you do let's say like in at five Seventy five and you only going to be in that house for two or three years\nThat first year would be at three Seventy five beyond that second year would be at four Seventy five it's actually a better alternative than to do than doing an arm\nAnd that you said we have it's not you you're not stuck with that thirty you're ... you're stuck with it no there you can get creative how'd you just need to understand the the cabinet to them you know things to be aware of you know if you do get creative and it and it's a lot less riskier today than it was ten years ago\nAnd ... and and that the that to one by don't um there's a cost involved with doing that though right now you could just take a little higher rate them in my day you adjust OK mentally at at the end in in that two years when it triggers you're taking higher thirty I never even thought to do that that's a really good idea to good\nToo hard or not and loans and ... well leave it on the reality of our like exactly you would just leave it to him a ... foot loom yeah All right out of home the whole there we\nGo [laughter] ... we have some other things we want to talk to you Bob but we're we're down to one minute before we have to take a break um you know there's still a lot of down payment assistance programs out there um that are available to people or you know\nDown home class home and five are literally people can get in you know or ... percent down\nUm there is you know I just want people to be aware of though there is a program in Maricopa County right now called pathway to purchase\nAnd that's a ten percent grant or they re issue did after a couple of years and the demand has been so strong for that program is that people actually aren't getting their funds who served in that they're not able to close on their house I mean we didn't\nGo to the more you want her

I'm going to make sure that there's a contingency plan in place so doesn't delay closing or cancel the contract\nA month or so ago and er and I think it was last month and I told them what time the client wanted to be there and a job was like oh man I Wish it was another day because I Can't be there I mean he was he I honestly just was not very happy with the fact that he couldn't make it but at the same time\nHe knew that they were you know that their client was in good hands and stuff\nAnd the reason I'm saying oh this is because you know do you believe in not I mean you're you're holding their hands throughout the whole thing you're providing complete service to your age and from beginning all the way to the end where you're sitting next to him at the closing people how important is that not just as a realtor before for you\nWell first if I could say I'm privileged to work with the best partners in the industry feel I don't need to be there for signing ... because of you there in wonderful hands preaching to a lot of work with Jeff\nJeff over here on this guy's amazing his team's fantastic they they work miracles as well uh but for me the working in the real estate industry working with clients it's about building relationships and that starts in the beginning or even before we speak for the first time\nA up into the closing and be on because I'm not looking to be\nYou know one time realtor I'm a ... for example I was with close close to deal with Jeff uh I don't know last week a man a man to 'em and uh I was back at her house this morning she had an issue um ... uh we we caught somebody out yesterday\nUh she said she was glad we were corner\nBut she's been amazing to wonderful comments gave us massage doesn't mean that doesn't have a lot of health\nSo she must have been very happy but but uh the job didn't get taken care of yesterday so we were back there at ten o'clock this morning or to make sure that it was getting taking care of but\nUh you know this is a man is first home she's I don't know twenty six years old or something like that and ... and she will probably by multiple homes and we want to\nBe her gold yeah yeah I was in\nThe referrals I mean we're so you know when somebody like that the way that you've treated them and the experience that they had when they say you know and they talked to somebody saying you know I'm thinking I'm In the market of some of my home or buying a home do you have an age and I can ... they're not just saying well I worked with this guy named Joe Brady I give them a call\n... that kind of experience they're going to say you know what you need to call Joe you know what I mean\nYeah it's funny that you say that because Amanda was actually a referral from uh another couple that we closed about three months ago with Jeff as well uh\nRight right and at on the wall I said Oh yes uh but they actually didn't refer her directly it was actually the daughter who we closed the deal with about three years ago that actually referred\nHer over to a so that's you know that's a whole entire family right they're handling and when we closed on friday\nAnd it was about nine thirty in the evening and I got a phone call which is cool I answer my phone anytime I'm but I answered it and it was\nIt was that the the two time from ago client that referred Amanda calling me from her vacation in New Orleans to say hey thanks I send over Amanda to to ask you a few questions like a month and a half ago she just told me she clothes that\nAre out of them are so great great and you you know you do you do carry ... and you and your reputation for you because you guys do um I ... and are known for your elevated levels of kind of a ... type of service that you provide to your clients buyers or sellers\nOr so but I mean it's just it's all about service because of the realtors or a dime a dozen states are I'm I'm rolling up my ... year old right now because it's getting busy but yeah I mean you guys are just take it to the next level\nWell you know our business you know\nGosh um it's a it's a it's a it is a ...\nMore than a fulltime job I'm In my opinion that coming from Twenty years of hospitality service industry or my opinion is\nYou know writing a contract and negotiating a transaction that's only a small part and I mean I've we've done a little bit of everything I mean we load up the truck with garbage shattered on lawns I've on\nPlug hole is I've done you know you name it he is the Swiss army knife actually\nRight now we're helping a couple in in a in a Sun City they have a a a rental property that they had they bought it at an amazing prize or more than doubled their equity in the home it's time to sell it and move on\nA they brought us and then they had several appointments scheduled contractors and they had all these ideas of you know thirty five to forty five fifty thousand dollars\nOf things they want it to do the property which is really not necessary where they you know we go by stats were using him allies and friends one selling homes\nAnd we're looking at what selling and what is the current competition and and and you know what what are they up against that has so and we think about the appraiser coming in and where they're going to value the\nProduct so you could potentially save them some money on by saying you don't need to do all of this to get that type of ...\nWe actually we brought in a contractor that we know nah I'm coordinating the process because um it would be easy for a contractor that come in there and do a bang up job through a beautiful job but they may not they don't know the trends and they don't know the competition\nAnd they give you example I I Know somebody who uh is going to be on their home and in June they started doing the things they thought they needed to do and yet the household a they're real estate agent is kinda bugging them hey we really need to get this on the market here it is now October the house is still not on the market and they're not dumping tons of money they're doing some other stuff and\nMyself and the ruler both said they don't need to do these things they don't need to do these things to get the dollar amount that they need but now we hear it on October and the market starting to soften a little bit and it's kind of moving from sellers you know little shifting\nThey may not now because they waited and they've they've kind of procrastinate because they thought that was the best thing they needed to do may not now get the dollar amount they could have gotten in June\nTrue and and also you know with all due respect I was thinking about that earlier in the segment when that was mentioned\nUh as I said before I you guys are I work with each and every one of the blessed to have that um but I'm In a different standpoint on this I'm On the front of the lines I'm Out there showing the homes riding the offers negotiating the hills\nAnd I don't see that much of that swing happening yet we're still submitting multiple offers went up when a when a property is priced effectively now\nIn a good location and they've done the right things to get it marketed than there is a lot of interest of course that changes from one price point to the next ... medals meetings we have such a broad range\nBut really all in all I mean if if those things are taken care of I'm Still seeing a lot of competition happening yeah yeah and then then that's good I mean 'cause you know what we hear is may not be exactly what's happening on the street level that that's right you know I I I I'd say that you know listen I'm the kind of guy that\nThat tries to get up on the right side of bed every morning and find them over lightning in most things I tried to but it never\nWill yeah so I I don't\nTend to walk around with a ton of frustrations on me but I Do have some frustrations for homebuyers are sellers and in some of my clients and that is one of those frustrations is\nIs how accurate is the data that they're listening to wrap seeming right where one of those statistics coming from I think that most of those statistics are driven from the multiple listing service but in my opinion and I see it happening all the time with a lot of your\nDiscount broke ridges and they're buying homes before they go on the MLS\nNot to mention they're buying them at a discounted rate\nThe home sellers thinks that they're getting a bill or when that may not necessarily be the case\nBut a lot of those deals are not being recorded and in the last ... how accurate is that data really right when when when the international reports that say\nThat homes sell home prices are declining our home sales are declining ... I I I ... what are they really absolutely I agree with you and then and then on top of that how old is that down and ...\nYou know how accurate and how old is it from what the the general public is is anything not to mention that we're hearing that debt that are being driven ... you know nationwide let's talk about we're we're buying and selling right here in Phoenix metro right\nAnd that's why I always say if you want to know what's going on in the real estate market you talk to the people who do it every day talk to people like yourself that are on the ground everyday talked to people like Jeff who who do this every day and they'll tell you the truth of what's happening today in in real estate market\nRight I Would like to say though with Amanda with a mad at first time homebuyer ... what what what down payment program that she would get home to us home plus thank God and I have to wait apart yeah I Know how to write a purchase so Amanda reach out to me on August fifteenth by text we texted back and forth and we spoke on the phone\nIt took her five days to kind of get things together and put her with Jeff\nNow on the twenty first of August\nWe were out looking at homes for the first time we looked at six homes and we wrote a very strategic offer model one of those homes and with the Jeff's help and the what program on plus there you go with the home plus we were able to negotiate\nNot only are closing costs we had a down payment uh she even got her appraisal paid for 'em we close Jeff closed his team close that deal literally in twenty eight days with a nominal three holidays because they want holiday three weekends right and so this morning I was at her house\nTo sprinkle [noise] you can really know the cancer that person for even penny for\nPenny doesn't make me\nThat doesn't make me feel better about my mouth [noise]\n\nCame in to my beautiful Mimi [noise]\nLearn more and moms can protect us all to mean can you tell them you can ...\n[noise]\n\nI everybody\nSpringer here [noise]\n\nEven Jonah Goldberg [noise] who was an anti Trump a Republican\nSerious thinker [noise] trigger you presenter [noise] fellow writer at the national review though he also he has a major a position to national if it wasn't me what is the managing editor of the online or something like that [noise]\nAnyway he wrote that the press has become an adjunct to the Democratic party and that it\nIt it it annoys him that the president's calling them fake news is true\nSo I think he's half annoyed that they're fake news and a half annoyed that they're justifying the president like sit there fake news I mean it I think that both annoy him equally a buddy to compound that the entire top half of the New York times is is extremely rare\nIt's reserved for Japan bombs Pearl Harbor or\nA Muslim terrorists a bomb World Trade center in Pentagon about Bob lead lead planes into\nAnd the entire hopped up or half I have it in my hands\n[noise] the the top two thirds that sets gigantic richest pictures of of bank deposits\nOf the father of Donald Trump here we have December seventeenth Nineteen Ninety that's the only day that I could see here\nA check written out here for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars by Fred Trump\nAnd let's see if can I make it any other date minutes you know maybe they don't have a picture here and then on the right to the right to talk to one third as Trump took part in suspect schemes to evade tax bills\nAt a at what age ... this is also stuff from Thirty years ago\nAnd ah there again there's a father's a tax returns so that's the ... it's a they have really by if you notice did you notice my dear listeners how littlest talked about Russian collusion recently\nI why might that be that was that was the dominant story from the election on because there is no story\nSo they're there and now they moved over at the same thing with a with Kavanaugh they the story is now his demeanor\n\nThat that's the story now just temperament does he have a judicial temperament\nSo remember\nThe temperament is based on the assumption that he didn't do what they said in high school\nSo he he uh I as a citizen and have a right to be angry on his behalf whatever happened in high school\nBecause of my original position that I stand by this never should have been a even a hundred you you you don't honor every single claim made against somebody forty years later to forty years later thirty six years later\nYou just don't mean murder\nUh if if you know vast vast Web of evil comes out there isn't a single corroborating piece of data and everybody we believe survivors\nBy the way I I I think it's an abusive the term survivor I think it should be relegated to where people survive\nA generally where they survived death so that's why we speak about prisoners of wars were survivors of Japanese internment camps Jews were survivors Nazi concentration camps cancer survivors\nIt's all it's all drama ... the the of the left of the drama queen ... society\n[noise] so let's say that man did not in fact\nGet angry they would have said that if he were innocent wouldn't be be angrier\nBike with me of course that would have said that when they've been right to so now it's about Trump's father and young Trump and well if these were schemes to evade obviously the first question why didn't the IRS get that moves a lot of money involved\nIt's Fifteen thousand word peace that only really dedicated people will read you read it so even you didn't read it will\nGive you an idea how much Fifteen thousand words are my book on happiness is fifty thousand words so this is the third the size of my happiness book [laughter]\nTo a very it's a serious about words\nThere is a story I find more important Frank me then that that was reported here in the college fix and there's a video of campus ... campus mob enraged by confirm Kavanaugh display\nSo the\nThe science I'm looking at a picture of the signs of students here at the University of Texas Austin may have to understand Austin is the liberal city in Texas and anyway any U. T. branch will be the usual let liberal or left\nSo I see signs confirmed Kavanaugh's the biggest along with change our mind a mix is Kavanaugh for justice Kevin did nothing wrong\nKangaroo courts in Congress a hash tag me too me too why does it mean to gone\nI mean ah and ... tech too far exclamation point Cabot not guilty and witch hunt alright\nSigns ripped up and anger chance of we believe survivors a large group of students became enraged Tuesday Afternoon that's yesterday by a pro brand Brett Kavanaugh table in effort at the University of Texas at Austin put together by its young conservatives of Texas chapter\nA crowd of furious students in circled the group and yelled at its members wall chanting obscenities and destroying their signs if you read my column yesterday you will understand why people on the left field at the normal rules of civil society do not apply to them\nThat is what it is these are this is our version of the super match the over a man the person who is above its really above man they're above the normal constraints that civil society and civilization put on people\nThat is how left this regard themselves they are not bound by Judeo Christian principles they are not bound by civil principles of the society\n\nSo the notion that you have a right to your opinion without me screaming around you obscenities\nAnd ripping up your ... does not exist for people on the left that exist for liberals but it doesn't exist for leftist\nTo conservative group had set had decided to set up ... confirmed Kevin on display in an effort to show support for the embattled the U.S Supreme Court judge nominee and argue that need for corroborating evidence\nSaid student Anthony also female we should have um a vice chairman of the group they drew up signs staving such phrases as\nA I guess it's all one I get it it's a\nHash tag me too me too gone hashtags too far I guess it's just that was to make a statement using hashtags Kavanaugh not guilty no campus kangaroo courts in Congress they also put up a change my mind sign of coal to debate peers\nOh debate the left doesn't debate may in circle\nBut see here we didn't want people to talk to us but unfortunately it's hard to do that when you have an angry mob ripping our science and screaming in our faces why can they rip their signed to not be arrested\nThat it that it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents extremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and a double standard that the Democrats are are showing right now\nOkay so that's a double standard issue what about the issue\nI have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans who or anti Kavanaugh on on the grounds of sexual assault ... forgetting they're against them because they would be against any Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nDon't they have husbands brothers fathers showings whom they love\nI mean why use all the identification visa Vee Vee Vee alleged victim\nAnd I was just talking to a group of hockey mom the other day and that's exactly what they were saying it and they fear for their husbands and their sons and their fathers that anybody can\nMake an accusation and it becomes the here\nBut the land is a fun hate headlines and there are are guilty by just public accusations and not having a fair hearing and not having any sort of private process to go through and and the Democrats will do anything they can to\nUh have an issue come up and attack Republicans and the the regular person out there Dennis I'm telling you it absolutely appalled that something like this uh comes up and and can be their son or their brother and her father and it's it's so deeply saddening to fit the the road that they've gone down\nSo ... is the issue you have to climb the Minnesota is simply now more or less liberal slash left\n[noise] uh no no no absolutely the tale that Tina that's half the climate is she's such a metro area liberal elite that this is not a DSL party Democrat farm labor here in Minnesota\nThat of my mother and father's area era it was mostly Democrat back in the day and it has the Democrat Party has lapsed a Democrat\nOr in the last ten years and it has become the far left extreme liberal socialist party of Minneapolis and St Paul and that it not who\nMinnesota Democrats are so they are leaving the party in the eighth district up on the iron range protests out historically always voted\nDemocrat we're going to have a Republican congressman up there down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat that's going to be Republican so Minnesota is not a Democrat as it used to be and we're what we're seeing a real red wave here uh because they've gone so far to the left and they've left that people and that's not who we are here in Minnesota\nAre you I I just want to tell you what I see every Republican candidate for Senate for how she is governor\nYou're not only running I mean this is on solicited advice I humbly acknowledge that fact what kind of ... you know every Republican which not only running against their opponents they're running against the destructive left wing party\nAs you just\nNoted and I I I salute you for doing that I think people have to understand as nice as and and I don't know your opponent but it's nice as any Democrat individually might be they represent a destructive force in America the Democratic party\nAnd they really do and it and it is a responsibility a on a Republican to make sure that the people know what that we really are the party at education and health care and freedom and\nThey are the party of obstruction and that's exactly what my opponent Tina Smith has been doing can only been in office for nine months and it every single turn a sea of directing and blocking
