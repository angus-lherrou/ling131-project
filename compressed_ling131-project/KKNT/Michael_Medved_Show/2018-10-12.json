presidential contest with President Trump\nHe um he has come back and he has been a constructive player in the Senate and you can talk to even people use to make fun of Ted Cruz most hated man in the

there's some drama early melodrama going on right here on earth not on the moon involving some people from outer space who brought their children to Washington DC\nAnd in the midst of a the ongoing

they had fifty one votes\nIn the Senate to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and that's a shame and a disgrace that\nThey didn't have more but there wasn't um there was only one Democrat Joe Manchin of West

hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] there's another piece in the Washington Post and I've read it a couple of times and the first time I read it I thought it must be a parody\nIs not

brown\nAnd she writes in the Washington Post under the headline a flood of rage is rushing through women's brains\nSo that kind of a mixed metaphor I mean you have real floods we just had Hurricane Florence but a flood of rage is rushing through women's brains why can't men organized to change themselves\nOkay she writes I yelled at my husband last night not pick up your socks yell this was real yelling this was thirty minutes of from the gut yelling sounds delightful triggered by a small falls dismissive annoyed patronizing comments really small\nI blew hard and fast and the terrified me I Wonder what he said she never says the comment that he made that was\nPatronizing and root they'd been married fifty years by the way I'm Still terrified by what I felt in what I said I Am almost Seventy years old I'm a grandmother yet in that roiling moment screaming at my husband is if he represented every clueless mail on the planet and I represented every angry woman of two thousand Eighteen\nI announced that I hate on end and wish all men were dead if one of my grandchildren are the L something that ridiculous I'd have to stifle left my husband of fifty years did not have to stifle alas\nHe took a dead seriously he did not to finish remark he did not defend men\nHe sat hunched in her and he listened for a moment occurred to me to be grateful that I'm married to a man who will listen to a woman\n[noise] um I I Am okay\nFirst of all can you imagine being a man and the circumstance and your wife is yelling at you because she's upset about the Kavanaugh hearing and yelling and yelling for thirty minutes\nOr one of things I haven't talked to my wife Diana about this but it it doesn't sound like that's the right response of your wife is yelling at you for thirty minutes straight\nOr for something that you said you know maybe you can follow the same SARS is upset you and me and well I'm going to go for a walk around the block good by a and there's it's not always the best thing\nTo simply sit and continue to be yelled at and sometimes it makes the yelling party even more ridiculous\n\nAnd then the storm surge wells up in me as I realize the pathetic impotence of nice men's plans to rebuild the wreckage by listening to women as my rage rushed through the streets of my mind more mixed metaphor\nA toppling every memory of every good thing my husband has ever done and there are scores of memories\nI said the meanest thing I've ever said to him don't you dare sit there and sympathetically promise to change do say you will stop yourself before you blurt out some impatient annoyed controlling remark no I said you can't change your unable to change you don't have the skills and you don't want to do it\nYou I said or one of the good men you respect women you believe in women you like women you don't hit women are raped women or in any way abused women you blood and funded feminism for half a century or one of the good ones\nAnd yet you cannot change you can listen all you want but that will not create one iota of change ... what what kind of changes she wants she wants them to change genders\nAnd is that the only way he can make up for this\nIt was in the centuries of feminine movements that have washed up in a way good men of not once organize their own mass movement to change themselves and their sons or to attack the mean spirited teasing punching\nThing that passes for male culture not once bastards don't listen to me listen to each other talk to each other or in your power for once\nThe gender war has broken out in

minds there's another part of your body you evacuate usually when good men like ... senator Christopher Coons Democrat Delaware give heartfelt sincere speeches about how we must listen to women I

program was the Gemini program my late father was the experimental director for the Gemini program and I kind of grew up hearing stories about Neil Armstrong\nAnd by the way all the stories that I heard from my late father about Neil Armstrong\nComport with what you see on screen which is that a Ryan Gosling as outstanding a performing one of those classic American heroes are kind of world it could have been performed by Henry Fonda\nSomebody who was heroic\nBut understated an unassuming with a quiet and mysterious deaths and in the film\nThey emphasize that part of the reason for that attitude\nWas Neil Armstrong's life at least according to this film in the book that it's based on\nRelated to a family tragedy which is very dramatically portrayed on screen at the beginning of the film every one is remarkable in this movie in terms of performances clear foie are playing Neil Armstrong's Wife Jan\nA ... and she was a long suffering wife and she was somewhat skeptical of what he was doing she said she wanted to have a conventional life and instead here he is an astronaut risking his life constantly and that's one of the things that the film brings back\nA very dramatically I I live in Seattle as people know and we have a a museum of flight here and you can go there and you can see some of these old space capsules that they actually use from the sixties and you look at them and they're incredibly small\nAnd rickety in dangerous and you think they really want to get into that things of this giant rocket can Hurley into space\nAnd yes people died in the space program and that's dramatized here to ah the the scenes in which director Damien ... who previously did la la land with Ryan Gosling and before that did whiplash which also won an Oscar for Jk simmons well deserved\nIf he does such a superb job I mean truly superb job of dramatizing the space flight itself the training and the Gemini flights in the dangerous flights that came before\nIt's um it's it's one of these films where you cannot take your eyes off the screen\nIt is so riveting and by the way Jason her which provides a film score that as heroic that is stirring that his captivating and very knowledgeable there's even a little bit of a nod to two thousand one space odyssey during one of the Gemini sequences where they're trying to hook up in space\nI'm the only reservation one can possibly have from the film\nIs that it's not the kind of a heroic wow we've done it totally satisfying triumphant conclusion you expect it's not the right stuff\nAnd uh ... what it shows also went emphasizes is it the space program had its elements of controversy you hear voices on screen about people who are questioning the value and the amount of money that we're spending on putting a man on the moon when we're going through very difficult times\nIn American urban neighborhoods but with all of that the caring about the characters including Jason Clarke Jason Clarke what a year for him he\nWas outstanding as Senator Ted Kennedy in a film about Chappaquiddick\nWhere Chappaquiddick happened in virtually the same week as the moon mission with Neil Armstrong Jason ... plays astronaut E.B White who was one of the best friends of Neil Armstrong and he is outstanding to um ... by the way one quick word\nThere's been some controversy that's been ginned up\nTo some extent by conservative media I'm afraid about why they didn't show the American flag on the moon they do\nAnd I don't know whether they put that in because of the protests in controversy what they don't show as they don't show a big scene where Neil Armstrong comes down in plants the American flag and I claim this land in the name of president Richard Nixon no that doesn't happen\nHowever there are American flags everywhere in this felt you see an American flag being raised you see the American flag patch on the shoulders of the astronauts on their uniform\nUh there are I I saw the film with rock star Greg Tom on my producer and uh he counted fourteen different flags scenes so don't worry about that\nThree and a half stars for a film that is rated PG Thirteen it's rated PG Thirteen for some very intense scenes of danger\nI imagine that most people who see this film are going to love it as I did and the uh it it is part of a succession you could have an entire sequence now\nOf movies about space program heroic movies remember Apollo Thirteen with Tom Hanks hidden figures a couple of years ago\nAnd a ... and then of course the right stuff now first man\nOr it is a very major Oscar

lesson or lessens what book OR Books perhaps it was a teacher or even a movie or a particular issue and I don't care if you were once a liberal are always a conservative\nEven if you are always a conservative something had to steal you to stay there or declare such right\nWhy did I get these questions because for the past few days in passing I had mentioned that I was once once a liberal which is to be Frank a bit of a skirting I was a fairly hard core leftist I head affiliated in high school with socialist organizations and even went through this in my early\nCollege years but for me it was a professor and a great deal of self study was responsible for my turn I've told you about the great works teachings I was privileged to have with Harry Jaffe he's who started me on this path\nAnd then er that I was I went to the library and not only read everything he wrote I went back to old issues and by old I mean Nineteen sixties in Nineteen seventies issues of commentary magazine\nAnd those days it was in its heyday featuring not only the best editor they ever had Norman put hearts but the best writers scholars\nAnd truth I didn't go back to old issues of National Review I think actually because the articles were too short in comparison and they were harder to access at my library but I did read nearly every book I Know of\nThat William Buckley ever wrote\nIt started when I was a college newspaper editor and I criticized professor Jeff in an editorial he called me up and we went and have coffee\nI doubt and the saddens me that too many professors do this any more take that kind of interest in the student that kind of time much less a world professor like Dr Jeff [noise] but to him he was a Fisher of men and he took me through graduate school with him and my life and world view changed\nIt started when I started recognizing what the left who is doing to free speech American history and exceptionalism and it's constant irritation with democracy as could be seen with its support for the PLO over Israel it made no sense as a leftist study ignored a lot of that stuff\nAs I grew older I realized how precious and important democracy was and that indeed the attacks on it were more and more the province of the left\nThis is not a unique journey William Bennett and Jeane Kirkpatrick have testified that they finally changed their registrations from the Democratic party that the Republican Party when the Democrats in Congress defunded the freedom fighters in Nicaragua\nBut as I say you don't have to have had a conversion experience just a reckoning or intellectual or mental one there are of course different kinds of conservatives and I've probably been appreciable of all of them at various times\nBut have learned as much from the ... as I have the neoconservatives says I have many traditionalists and libertarians I think it'd be fair to say we all agree on a few things\nBill Bennett and John ... put it in a nice acronym and their book called America strong they came up with a acronym Flint\nFree enterprise limited government individual liberty national defense in traditional values\nOf course there are various ways to say these things or embrace them one definition of conservatism I've always liked was an economics of liberty in a sociology a virtue\nWhich gets me to a debate I was watching this morning that took place at Notre Dame between my other great professor Charles Kessler and the national reviews Jonah Goldberg they were debating of course Trump\nJuno's objections to Trump come down to his lack of decency or as virtue deficit his personal morality and he makes one compelling case in this one we shouldn't have to lie about Trump's deficits to defend him of course to he forgets that someone's sometimes ones deficits can be their virtues\nWas Lincoln who said show me a man without vices and I'll show you a man without virtues\nBut there's a larger point and saving this country only Donald Trump could do it to the degree that only Donald Trump could beat Hillary Clinton and I think it was just ... they caught him attention from those who otherwise would not have paid attention or been ho hum about the election\nJournal makes a big deal about how Trump's victory in the primaries was not that big of a deal because of the way the primary system worked but that's not really the point\nOf course well history cannot reveal its alternatives I think it pretty fair to say and I think most would agree with me that there really wasn't another candidate up there that could have beat Hillary Clinton in the general election once the primaries where one\nThere weren't really any of the other candidates among them that could appeal to the places Obama had won ... Hillary ... last\nWho could take her game of dirty politics and throw it right back in her face like he could and did\nAnd of course his campaign theme was pure wonderful is\nMake America great again as Tocqueville had observed about another country it is quite understandable that one of the nation as badly government should develop a wish to govern itself\nBut it continues the desire for independence of this kind stemming as it does from a specific removable cause the evil practices of a despotic government is bound to be short lived once the circumstance is giving rise to ... passed away and language ...\nAnd ... at first sight seeing the genuine love of liberty\nProves to have been merely the hatred of a tyrant is is the same thesis as another Frenchman John Francois Roosevelt and his book on how democracies perished she wrote clearly a civilization that feels guilty for everything it is and does elect the energy and conviction to defend itself\nSo there are two things here a memory and cherishing of the circumstances that gave us our country and here of course we'd be talking about that magnificent serve our founding and secondarily a clear conviction that it is worth preserving as much as by being worth defending\nAnd it's a remarkable thing to me that the left has surrendered both\nTo them our founding was not so remarkable at best and racist insect sexist at its worst and that leads them to seeing the bitter fruit from what they have planted as a poisonous tree feeling guilty and defending our interests much less our country\nThat is that is the ... that is the disease of dystopia an enemy that is so characterize so much with the left and taking the entirety of the Democratic party with them\nSo much so that they are speaking the pros they once thought they were condemning how else do you understand those who claimed to have racism say about a black rap artist that he is a traitor to his race or an example of what happens when a duck or negro doesn't read\nOr the doubling down today from Don Lemon calling Kanye West a menstrual show [noise] that of course is all just over the past forty eight Seventy two hours and butter symptom\nBut telling one at that for it will pass without controversy so I Am interested what makes you a conservative what person Booker event or a combination of those things and what it what issues what issues do care most about\nNot a bad thing to do about now on this open lines and yes fun friday the number six zero to\nFive zero eight zero nine six zero hope you're keeping up with all the audio that has been revealed about care students cinema of late\nCourse you've heard Cory report on the news about her statements regarding Arizona in condemning Arizona and the Republicans of Arizona\nAs crazies that's bad enough there's a new audio out\nJust a few years ago in two thousand three she sat on a radio show I don't care if people go and fight for the Taliban in Afghanistan she was talking to a radio host in February of two thousand three and the host a libertarian\nSet as an individual if I Want to go fight and the Taliban are Taliban army I go over there and I'm fighting for the Taliban and that's a personal decision\nKirsten Sinema she said fine I don't care if you go and do that go ahead [noise]\nBut you don't talk down to us and that they give us a little bit more credited as listeners may be put her arms around some of the more complex concepts and issues and so I have to run but good luck with the show\nWe'll thing Tomlin with everything I think ...\nThank you sir that means a punt me I'll tell you I'm I learned that from um or to the degree that that's true what you said it's something I learned from from two teachers of mine one was a professor of literature um at Harvard I I never went to Harvard but she was a friend of mine named Ruth twice\nOr who's writing was always elegant his public speaking even more so and I once asked her about that and I ever ... have you ever worried about losing an audience and she said\nNo I always assumed the audience and people in it are smarter than me which is a nice assumption to make in a difficult I think and it shows respect for the audience and I've also learned from whether it's Bill Buckley or bill Bennett\nThat a few a pinch pitch a just a little bit higher most people actually want to catch that ball\nMost people actually want to take a swing at it uh and you'll notice that this is true in the younger ages to you know I learned this in school reform I suppose\nUm that when you want to talk to students\nPerhaps an underperforming classrooms are under performing a class is one of the things they would you know say in different variations is we want to learn what the smart kids are learning we want to know what the smart kids are known\nSo you know I'm I'm a I'm I'm happy to bring whatever I can from the shoulders of giants I've been able to stand on\nAnd are delighted that uh it's a
