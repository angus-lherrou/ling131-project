idea that the court intervenes on behalf of someone like that I mentioned that there was another case that shows you exactly why you need this by the way ... also white\nThe and I mentioned that because the Supreme Court is using racial injustice as the basis for throwing out the death penalty on these folks who have\nAll been arrested they've been tried they haven't been investigating been convicted again and again and again and again\nAnd they deserve the death penalty\nParticularly Byron sure why he was convicted of killing a correctional officer named Jamie bendel by strangling her

justices\nA balance a law they don't like should all of sudden take it out throw it out ruin all the time and all\nThe different if you know prosecutors I Know a bunch of prosecutors it is so heart so

nomination and all of the controversies surrounding that decision to confirm as nomination whether it's over the Washington Supreme Court today saying that the eight\nMurderers incredibly brutal murderers only them who are on death row in in the state of Washington are they all instantly\nHave the death penalty withdrawn they are now going to spend life in prison but probably knowing the way these things work that won't even be held true I mean the only reason people spend\nA life in prison today as if they are really notorious killers like Charlie Manson who died in prison of course or Sirhan Sirhan we just have the fiftieth anniversary he should receive the death penalty but that was another Supreme Court decision\nThat spared their lives that was a federal decision by the way by our old Supreme Court\nAh one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number you can also reach us\nBy Twitter and we've had a big upsurge in our a Twitter activity recently I think a lot of the surrounding the Brett Kavanaugh issue but uh you can reach us with a tweet or disagreeing tweet\nBy going to a ... show on Twitter that's at mid ... all one word on Twitter\nOkay this came in from John in ...\nWashington he says yesterday a caller proposed that we are in the Cold War and a political sense you rejected\nIt and he had trouble defining you stated that the object of a war is to defeat an enemy actually I didn't say that I said the object of a war is to destroy an enemy is to kill your enemy and wreck his stuff just wipe them out\nIt's not just defeat\nJohn says this is exactly what is going on meaning to defeat an enemy not to destroy him the Democrats have decided to use any means necessary to defeat the Kavanaugh nomination\nThey've abandoned all decency\nIt is a Cold War because bullets are not being shot but there is no question the Democrats mean too politically professional and socially killed Brett Kavanaugh it is a Cold War\nAnd now Kavanaugh and his family are getting death threats is this is not a Cold War Michael I don't know what would be a Democrats have Declared Political unprofessional war against this man looks a term Cold War is also misunderstood\nWhat people mean by Cold War is limited war\nIt was not bloodless we lost fifty eight thousand Americans in Vietnam we lost almost forty thousand in Korea uh during the so called Cold War we lost\nCountless other Americans and different hot spots around the world uh there were very certainly an episode of the Cold War was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan\nAnd the push back against that a lot of people who died and I do think it is wrong to analogize the idea\nOf of trying to smear and discredit somebody and wreck his career I think it's despicable I think what the Democrats did was despicable I think their whole handling of the capital matter was shameful and unconscionable and wrong in his right to be condemned\nBut to call it murder\nIs also obliterated distinctions and I think sanctions need to be restored to our public debate I'll give you one example I woke up thinking about this is people are now talking about everybody as a survivor\nRight anybody who was ever complained about sexual misbehavior some guy no matter how far in the past or how limited than this behavior is now a survivor of abuse\nAnd I was thinking of Anita Hill and this is not to say that if Clarence Thomas were guilty of the things he's accused of that it would be justifiable indefensible would have been wrong\nBut the idea that any of the hill a survivor what did she survived exactly\nShe survived um some rude comments that made her uncomfortable that song\nNo charges any workplace consequences to her work by Clarence Thomas or no charges that he ever touched her\nI I mean to say that\nIs a survivor and somebody who's been raped at knife point is also a survivor of there's a difference and yes there's a difference between Bill Cosby\nAnd Les Moonves iffy what Bill Cosby drugged people\nThat's more serious and to lose all perspective to say that we are now dealing with a civil war because we're dealing with a moral issue the equivalent of slavery\n... it's it's just wrong\nAnd no one expects that there are big parts of America that are going to have their duly constituted governments [noise] leave the union form armies and we're all going to be finding one another and they're going to be hundreds of thousands were killed\nSo the analogy with the civil war I think detracts from people engagement with reality where you can make\nA real difference in bringing America to a more constructive place by voting in this election I Hope everybody does\nAnd vote for sanity and insanity\nMean stop the talk of impeaching Kavanaugh stop the talk of impeaching Trump stopped to talk of oh my goodness this is the ... total nightmare of The Handmaid's tale we're losing all our liberties and the women are being\nI'm Down as the end of the world get a grip we have some problems in this country but hysteria doesn't help and solutions let's go to North ridge California Eric you're on the ... that show disagreement day\nMike I'm a longtime listener conservative here and um I Do agree that this commentary about a civil war is a override in its comments but I disagree with you you\nAre in that I Do see a future of separation coming [noise] have mentioned the tree reformed calls and what's actually coming to this coming on the horizon for our country is a divorce\nThis idea that there's gonna be a war you are yourself or just building this up with this idea that there'd be hundreds of thousands of people killed we have a great separation and we have a mechanism available to us and I'm Wondering why what\nWhat is the ... what's the mechanism\nOh so you don't just want ... let me say this we talked about before why would you deprive be one of the great rights provided to me in the constitution and that for freedom of association\nI didn't know you you have you with us can really find any more than don't but you you live in the same country with them you live in the same country with them there is no right in the constitution for secession it doesn't exist you know and\nThat's like we discuss how before it's lots of session what it is a dissolution of the union which has provided through article five the mechanism is available through article five and would not be a war\nOkay how what how was that was a mechanism provided for dissolution of the union they never anticipated that and it's not there there's an article five a convention of the states is to propose changes in the constitution that still have to then be approved by three quarters of the states the\nMike I called in about a year ago you had a constitutional scholar on and he agreed you you simply don't\nWant no no no no I it's it's it's if you believe a convention of the states could provide for the dissolution of the union or you just have to then get three quarters of the states to vote to dissolve the union and they want\nAs a student of history Mike I Want to quote something to you went in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the bands that bind them to\nAnother that have had that African academically and now there are some buying disconnected them but but go ahead okay so ...\nCorporation of independence and our great founding fathers realize that these things happen in the\nControlled by some very extensive money didn't trust for the benefit of ended up people waking up\nAnd they're trying to establish British tried to create the impression through their control the media sources are mostly been trying to make the believe it's us against them\nThey don't focus on what the real issues are\nWhat are the real issues might\nWe look at everything from from war volition to the quality that's been created in our well so I don't I Will system of the huge issues that we don't we [noise]\nWe what do you mean they're not being dealt with in other words the two parties disagree and it's a tough time a tough time to find middle ground but you say that are are medical care system you don't think we spent a long time over the last ten years arguing about that it's more than ten years when Bill Clinton was first elected president and he came in and Nineteen nineties\nYeah Michael who's you're working for working for the medical industry the insurance industry and the attorneys were older nickel stylish but it is\nIt's working great for them to have gotten extremely wealthy and powerful by doing nothing except tried it off to the courts weren't sure the executive branch out to the large your doctor\nOK well wait wait wait wait wait I again when you talk about some kind of ... men conspiracy was the establishment for Obamacare or was it against Obamacare\n[noise] it was for it [noise]\nOkay ah then when the ... you will agree with me that there was a very significant difference of opinion between Republicans and Democrats or wasn't a single Republican not even one in either house and Congress voted for Obamacare\nShot an issue there what\nWait wait you're saying that they ignored this issue the last ten their own approach to medical care\nWhich I think was the wrong approach which is that what about medical care needs to improve his more government involvement I think we would all benefit from less government involvement\nAnd and people having more freedom of choice in getting their own insurance arrangements that it it seems to me is going to be one of the challenges for the next two years for President Trump and the Republicans if we maintain are majorities in Congress we we've got to continue moving in that direction\nThe idea that these issues that you bring up that aren't instantly resolved ah it it doesn't mean that there's some kind of establishment conspiracy look there are a lot of people in the United states of America who are doing a lot better in the last two years and it is not just rich people the\nThe fact is that if you look at the wages that have been going up I mean even Ralph Nader acknowledge that when we were talking to him on the economic growth that has happened in the last two years\nHas benefited everybody in the country\nAnd look with that too bad days on Wall street I Hope that won't be the end but you see the the problem with all these ideas about some all knowing establishment is it just trying to put some order some fake water into what is by its very nature a very does orderly and sometimes chaotic process\nIt is disagreement day on the Michael ... show that means that is your day to take me on on issues\nWhere you think I Am flat out wrong\nOr you have to

California New York the overlords of everyone in the front of the central part of the\nCountry I think it's a bad idea but if if they're able to push through a constitutional amendment I'm making for direct election of the president it's hardly a revolution I mean revolutions and\nI don't think it's going to happen in that way but what they can do is they can ruin your business and they can they can attend\nOh you're right I and I'm opposed I'm opposed to their program but you see there are a lot of programs that are bad an ill advised in stupid I'll give you an example Lyndon Johnson's great society programs was a colossal waste of money and it's created a lot of physical problems we have right now in this country were created there\nBy spending it was well over\nI think they say fifty trillion total and adjusted dollars\nAre in failed anti poverty programs president right in ... but but however that wasn't a revolution was pro radical\nBut but when you're changing the way things have always been done like\nA you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a life time activists lawyer for the ACLU right and she ... the three of because of rising consent made meant something different background now they're changing it where this is a political football\nNow okay but I mean we're we're going to start we're going to fight and as I and I think those are ... are on it before hold on I think those are unfortunate\nChanges but when you start talking about revolution you start thinking about gear teens you start thinking about those are and his family killed by firing squads you start talking about blood on the streets\nAnd frankly I don't think it's helpful for winning the case in other words being opposed to revolution and to basically blowing up America doesn't mean a being a defender of every aspect of the status quo there aspect to the status\nQuo that need to be changed but we talk about that all the time Jacob in Everett, Washington Jacob you're on the bed show disagreement day\nLike oh this is talk of last year my wife's actually go and catcher of this moment and up all the time of thank you one quick like you say there's there's been no bloodshed and shot for talk of Steve's college\nRight again uh we have here we are however it's\nGoing to happen today is not going to happen tomorrow but we're ... this was gonna be a cyclical college mentality is now flipping out and what they're doing is testing it's going to evolve\nOkay walking the streets and what's gonna happen in ... you probably aren't going\nTo be taken hostage by a bunch of idiots on the freeway right on a ... it's escalating to the point where it will become what they don't want it to be\nWhich is what what she is there will be small pockets that will revolt with him two hundred years if this country will not\nOkay why why do you say that with such certainty\nI guarantee you I think the double devolve ing everything even my kids that go to school every day is political and pointed against okay it is you know why am I going to need to be in America\nAnd they will be secluded and pointed to it's going to happen and within two hundred years it's not going to be OK nearly a civil war it's got to your race it will happen\nOkay why why are you so convinced why have we been able to a re a avoid race war we had urban Ryan so we are very serious in the Nineteen sixties where there were literally thousands of people who ended up being killed or arrested in business has destroyed a thank God we haven't gone back into that pattern\nBut when you say there is going to be a race war we've had race war ... ah we've had race riots of whites against blacks are there were all kinds of people in the whole neighborhood destroyed in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Nineteen twenty six\nWe'd had all kinds of upsets in this country that Adam Smith who wrote is the author of contemporary capitalism once wrote that there is a great deal of ruin in a nation in other words when people say we can't possibly survive\nA ... with the bet against America it's usually a losing bet I uh\nI appreciate your call a let's go to Bradley in Phoenix, Arizona Bradley you're on the mend then show

it's not going to be anything that we go to ... ... it's a long term slow lead and everything that we hold dear in western\nOkay look I I Do not disagree that there are some forces at the fringes in American\nLife who won two completely and fundamentally changed our civilization who don't want us to learn anything\nAbout Shakespeare or Plato or the Bible yeah their forces like that\nBut the evidence that they are quote succeeding and sleeping all before them and wiping out American wiping out our heritage that evidence is not there and it's not useful to get people in an apocalyptic

Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a restaurant or Ted Cruz in a restaurant and you get more add the shouting and disrupting of the Senate Judiciary committee hearings and you have what me might just be called a mob\nMob it's defined by Webster is quote a large and disorderly crowd of people close quote add the rest of what we describe here\nAnd you could call it a violent mob but as we discussed yesterday when Donald Trump says you don't give power to an angry mob the media goes crazy they've said nothing by the way about Hillary's ... request to the people not be civil mind you\nBut an accurate description of our times by Donald Trump and CNN goes crazy as does the Washington Post and the New York times\nAs our friend ... put one of the Washington Post seemingly seemingly endless table a biased trumped resist stirs accuses Republicans who decry left wing mob tactics of hypocrisy\nShe claims that Republicans used to love mob rule she notes that during the debate over Obamacare the Tea Party was quite vociferous at town hall meetings but of course town hall meetings or one of the places where in a well functioning democracy grievances are supposed to be aired vociferous Lee and let me add\nA town hall meeting is ... is usually in was usually called for by those who were the vociferous\nWhere are the Washington Post's examples of Tea Party or other conservatives running through the streets smashing windows and assaulting demonstrators of a different persuasion may have none nothing comparable to antifa worthy examples of conservatives harassing political opponents and restaurants are on the street\nWell they do present one which may or not may or may not have involved conservatives\nThey write in Nineteen eighty nine then house in ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski was chased down us ... Chicago street by a group of seniors angry about the cost\nOf a new Medicare catastrophic health insurance program when one of them draped yourself over the head of his car the six foot four congressmen escaped by dashing through a gas station okay\nSo one incident may be done by a conservative maybe not nearly Thirty years ago that demonstrates their attempt to drawn equivalence between the mob actions of the left spurred on by elected Democrats and the activism of conservatives it's all nonsense I suppose now\nWould be a good time to ask when the last time was a liberal or left wing speaker at a college campus needed a security detail but every conservative sure does if again if the invite is to even go forward to an actual event\nYeah there's going to be a lot of security for that conservative by the way\nIt might also be a good time to remember that members of the media continually tell us they are at risk of violence because of Donald Trump calling them the enemy of the people\nEven though they show no evidence of it what so ever\nAll of this puts me in mind the medicine we all read need right now but a medicine the patient the Democratic party may not want to take for them it may very well be that the disease in our body politic\nIt's preferable to the cure but these times are not unknown to us it's just that they don't end well one thinks of the writing in the sixties but destroyed once great cities and neighborhoods that still have not recovered one thinks more about the events that led to the civil war the famous one\nAnd it was very early years when he was only twenty eight years old Abraham Lincoln gave one of the most important speeches in American history\nIt comes to us now is the ... see I'm address and he was lamenting the increase the mob

of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country and never tolerate their violation by others\nAs the patriots Seventy six did to the support of the declaration of independence so to to the support of the constitution and laws but every American pledge his life his property and the sacred honor but every man remember that to violate the laws to trample on the

mainstream nor popular they just have the loudest voices and control the media outlets so it appears they are the majority sincerely Jeremy there's a lot of wisdom and this\nAnd I want to weigh in particularly on two things one less important\nThan the other the less important they'll start with liberal radio shows there are a few there are a handful\nNPR by the way is not the most liberal\nWhen is the last time a we had to actually really condemn NPR oh we don't much because I'm frankly they do a fairly good job a fairly good job at least on their news shows\nOf presenting both

Hollywood they've cut corporations they've got corporate boardrooms they've got\nThe education system K. through twelve elementary secondary and post secondary gosh knows the universities [noise] and then there's another subtle point which is small but big\nAnd it's that they have no sense of humor\nI don't think you can do a good talk radio show without a sense of humor or culture for that matter um don't you think were funny don't you think we're\nWe have a good sense if you don't you think Dennis is hilarious of course the U.S [noise] um yeah you need to have a sense of humor um which is
