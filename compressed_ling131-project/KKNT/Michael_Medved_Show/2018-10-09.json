{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "But marijuana even more so the analysis\nWas published in the American Journal of psychiatry and found the cannabis had greater short and long term consequences than alcohol on four key components of teens memory\nThe finding greatly surprised researchers\nWe initially suspected alcohol would have a bigger effect said the lead author of the study professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal her name is Patricia con rod researchers looked at for cognitive functions problem solving\nLong term memory short term memory\nAnd the ability to stop the habitual behavior when needed\nMarijuana had significant negative effect on all four of the study\nCould not tie alcohol to negative effects is among teenagers and by the way it is [laughter] it come this conforms to my own record\nIt was an experiences in college because what I'm Talking about okay if people were were teenagers\nIn late teens\nAnd basically my freshman year in college pretty much everybody did beer that was the drug of choice and then all of a sudden boom it's ah Nineteen sixty six sixty seven and marijuana\nAnd there is no question that the cognitive impairment particularly things like short term memory loss and problem solving there were there were many people including one to the three of the people that I ruined with where\nIt was it was a visible problem if you could see it immediately wasn't\nSubtle authors examine four thousand students and the Montreal region over four years starting when the average participant was about Thirteen Years old the students took yearly memory tests and self reported their alcohol and marijuana use those reports are kept confidential\nBy the fourth year three quarters of the students and consuming alcohol at least occasionally well only about thirty percent use marijuana regularly but the study observe more daily marijuana users and alcohol users the study found some of the marijuana as negative effects were lasting\nA particularly troubling finding young cannabis users may cause long term damage to a brain function associated with substance abuse\nWhen studying response inhibition that's an individuals' ability to change their actions tell me the goal researchers found the teens using marijuana causes long term damage to their brains\nLet's go to Don in Ventura, California Don you're on the Michael ...\nMichael thing you bet [noise] I have a similar story or a mess and\nFor the last Twenty years have been trying to locate those shows that I lost would explain that I was addicted to it [noise] or migration of started with alcohol and led to marijuana then they know that for Twenty years but it always has to be sensational more sensational so and then the other drugs\nAnd finally at thirty six I'm I put it in a way for good because I had a a a Christian reborn experience\nHowever the worst part about it as a result my sons have addiction problems as well and

powerless and that you need some help in in dealing with with this particular kind of addiction done I appreciate your calling and I appreciate your perspective\nLook this is one of those things I mean there's some things that are really really difficult to figure out in the world\nBut honestly if you think about it think about how much better it is not to be addicted to some substance\nReally whatever the substances booze\n... if you don't feel right until you had a few drinks\nI and I can tell you I've been in that place in my life [noise] but it's so much better to be independent of

he takes his place today\nOn the Supreme Court of the United states there in session it's October they were hearing oral arguments earlier today [noise]\nI I think justice Kavanaugh and yes now he is justice Kavanaugh about just judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke beautifully last night there is a real object lesson\nThat I learned that I Want to share with everybody and it's a lesson about\nWhy some people are so indignant\nAbout fake news [noise]\nAnd that's not to say that I'm not big news about um undignified about this it's just that we've had bias in the media for a long long time but sometimes it's particularly egregious and I'll give me an example\nI um had watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen allies\nAnd the ceremony last night was in the White House with a President Trump welcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad and his wife Ashley\nThat's a judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley and I'm just\nTrying to make all the judges justices of the spring court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nicer than bump ruined it as it does because what he said was outrageous and he was ... and he ruined and never before any spoiled that and it's disgusting and horrible\nAs you know what when you watch it that is simply not true and let me tell you one\nArea where I honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw on NBC and very much on CNN which deliberately misleading they made it sound\nAs if a justice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything the justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people introduce every they all walked in together and then the president said thank you very much thank you members of Congress members of the cabinet honoring gifts and fellow Americans uh my privilege to address you tonight from the East Room of the White House\nAnd then after a welcoming everybody he said joining us for tonight's ceremony as every sitting Supreme Court justice chief justice Roberts thank you Justice Thomas thank you Justice Ginsburg thank you justice prior thank you Justice Alito thank you\nJustice Sotomayor thank you Justice Kagan thank you and justice Gorsuch now why in that order that's the order at which they were appointed to the court\nAnd\nThen he said this in setting up how his particular performance of his duty ... helping to watch the swearing in of the justice here to a point to how this was going to be different\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps than any other event of such magnitude\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to breath and the entire family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure [noise]\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat happened to the cabinet or family violations every notion of fairness decency and due process to our country a man or woman forced to always be presumed innocent fun to lash him doing to proven guilty [noise]\n\nOkay and then he goes on to make the most controversial declaration he made in their statement he goes on to say that\nThe justice or capital was proven innocent now okay he's not proven innocent\nBut he was certainly judged innocent by anybody who's reasonable enough to look at this and to look at the ... of evidence upon earns of evidence\nWas that anybody who was there at the time any of the name the witnesses agreed with him not\nIn saying that I Know this didn't happen but in saying no I I don't remember this at all and I don't remember it at all like the way that\nChristine afford described it here's what President Trump said that you share\nUnder historic scrutiny were proven innocent so if you\n[noise]\nMargaret analyze their father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens and now from the bench of our nation's highest court\nYour father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms hopeful\nAmericans you know [noise]\nOkay this is just fine and it's touching because you can look at the way the Kavanaugh family his daughters Margaret in ... ... we're looking up at him and his wife Ashley when when\nPresident Trump was saying these words and what he says saying he's a man of decency character kindness and courage\nThere is no one who has stood up to say anything different no one and\nAnd you know that if there were someone who said oh yeah ten years ago he cheated mayor ten years ago I saw him beating up somebody areas drunk or is that\nThey would have come forward they wouldn't be publicize a great deal the best they could do was to get three different women none of whom had any corroborating evidence\nWho were charging him with being a jerk freshman year of college or in high school\nAnd [noise] sorry\nThat doesn't take away the idea that he has lived a lifetime showing himself to be a man of decency character kindness encouraged President Trump\nConcluded\nModerated allies as presidents tonight reminds us flooded his historic\nYour father is all about it's about what kind of a nation we're going to be and what kind of a country our children\nIt is up to each of us and do all Americans watching tonight to answer that question\nIs up to us to reclaim our heritage of equal and impartial justice is up to us to dedicate ourselves to the traditions and wisdom of our founders\nAnd it is up to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that leads us falls to gather as one great American family [noise]\nAnything\nWrong with that it it doesn't seem\nTo me there as it seems to me that President Trump was in the right spirit for the occasion as he was with these last comments introducing the actual swearing and listen\nJustice Kavanaugh Phil's place left by Anthony Kennedy soon Justice Kennedy will administer the judicial both\nJust as he did last year for justice Gorsuch this will be the first time a Supreme Court justice has ever sworn in a former clerk to take his seat a beautiful moment which reminds us\nThat freedom is a tradition passed down from generation\nTo generation because that's a big statement and I want to thank you for that so much so\n[noise] it is beautiful or if if there's someone who really believes that this was a disgrace somehow that that President Trump ruin this occasion\nYou can give us a call and tell us why 'cause I don't see it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and judge Kavanaugh\nSpoke particularly beautifully and yes I I think that some of his inter\nChanges with the senators at his hearing more and more testy than they needed to be\nSo this is a time when you might expect a president a president to call for us to be put aside to put aside our differences to call for unity or you might expect any other presidents do that but not this one\nPresident Trump his actions and his words so everything you need to know the president is using division as a weapon and he's probably he's proud of it when he and his party yet\nRon matter how much it costs Americans were proof remember his divisive language tonight or at\nOkay I I thought that was a strong column and you'll notice that he ... he wrote in that column that he he lost his temper and he\nSaid I said some things that I should not have said that was his exact words and I think that what he had in mind was exactly what would you talked about which ... which made me cringe as well\nIt it was wrong for him given the fact that he's on the Supreme Court now to be so political as to specifically blamed the Clintons by name and there's another reason for that only ... the Clintons had much to do with it frankly I think that it was Dianne Feinstein and the people on the committee\nAnd the the whole thing was set up but um I I I think he he made an inappropriate comment\nAnd and by the way and acknowledged it so and it it can't you recognize that he did something fairly extraordinary and in a acknowledging that he said some things that he shouldn't have said\nNo we're talking about the highest court in Atlanta and knowledge meant there is problematic because forever now it it can raise real question and they're all on you\nKnow it ... and ... and now let me give you an example I I've talked before on the show but not not an enough length\nAbout the longest serving Supreme Court justice in history who was a big hero to liberals you know who it is right\nTo William oh Douglas from yeah come on Washington and justice Douglas or for thirty six years on the Supreme Court he wrote some of the most important legal decisions some of which are kind of nutty but they're very important and justice Douglas had so\nMany ethical problems and just named one of them she actually because he had so many alimony payments he had three ex wives\nAnd a he had to write little articles to help meet the expenses because he wasn't generating enough money and he wrote articles for a guy who happened to be a pornographer who had a case before the courts\nAnd he later than pay the money back but he was caught with that\nAnd and that she also wrote articles that it had appeared in like a magazines were some justices thought were pornography he didn't\nAnd just that plus the fact that he got involved with a Twenty one year old would have been assigned to do a term paper and her college about justice Douglas he was married at the time he got involved with her it could be construed as sexual harassment today's terms it didn't ruin his judgeship\nA and by the way there were attempts to impeach him and they were foolish and I oppose those attempts uh they were led by Gerald Ford who later became president of the United states as a point over here is that when people say oh because he said I'm\nSome in temperate things when he was giving testimony he can never be taken seriously as a judge Clarence Thomas was had a\nFine career on the court he's made some by the way brilliant and amazing speeches since being confirmed on the court\nAnd uh I don't think he has been ruined by the charges against him or let them ruined him at all David I appreciate your call very much um do we have a time to go to the audio Jeremy for from Cairo okay we are coming up\nWell

is out of the United nations she was a strong and great advocate for our freedoms interest\nAnd for our country's interests and it was unique to see her and President Trump announced her resignation together diminishing as much as possible the palace intrigues that otherwise would take place\nOne Richard Goldberg tweeted the following I picked up a power line and think it's just about white right one Nikki Haley is a star and hard to replace to\nHer views aligned with secretary Pompeo Ambassador John Bolton last reports of diminishing rules are being forced out or just silly\nThree two years in a job like that is a long time for announcing it before midterms makes certain sense thank you Nikki Haley that sounds about right to me and if Nicki can more easily go out on the stump and the house things to help Republican candidates between now and election time\nNovember six so much the better she is to repeat a rock star\n[noise] might be fun to think about who should replace or it might be fun to think about if she is going back to take a seat in the Senate replace Lindsey Graham who has spoken of is replacing Jeff Sessions whole lot of those possibilities exist\nAnd feel free to call with your idea of a good replacement for her at the un I have two views on this on the one hand this is not a big deal\n[noise] on the other hand it could or should be\nIt's not a big deal in this sense and I'll tell you why quick tell me play a game who were the last four United Nations representatives can you name ... take a minute or two take five nearly impossible to do\nOn the other hand we do remember outspoken representatives for America at the un just as we recall and will probably continue to recall Nikki Haley we obviously very fondly recall Jeane Kirkpatrick\nThat's the other hand the position can be used to propel and propagate American and western interests if the import if the appointment is good and if the person holding the position believes in\nStanding a sport of third world cargo of authoritarianism\nTo quote George Will that's what ambassador Kirkpatrick did\nAs did Nikki Haley which takes me to the larger issue here the defense of the west it doesn't have a lot of defenders now there was Stephen Harper for sure in Canada perhaps the most outspoken defender of western values but he's gone\nAnd during the Obama years we suffered eight years primarily at the United nations uh running down the United states\nHe compared to ... to the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri which became the rioting in Ferguson, Missouri and he continued continually said the United states had a lot of apologies to make\nAnd apologize he did it didn't not in comparison to every other member of the United nations we have nothing to apologize for not by any comparison or contrast but it gets us generally to the defense of the west\nWho had no greater defenders in our last century than the likes of Franklin Roosevelt Harry Truman John Kennedy Ronald Reagan and the man about whom several movies have recently been made Winston Churchill\nChurchill to quote Leo Strauss when he learned of ... Churchill's passing was this\nThe death of Churchill as healthy reminder to academic students of political science of their limitations the limitations of their craft\nThe tyrant stood at the typical of his power the contrast between the indomitable and magnanimous statesmen in the in St tyrant this spectacle spectacle and clear simplicity was one of the greatest lessons which men can learn at any time\nNo less in lightning is the lesson conveyed by Churchill ... failure which is too great to be called tragedy I mean the fact that Churchill corrupt actions on behalf of human freedom against Hitler only contributed through no fault of Churchill's to increase the threat to freedom\nWhich was posed by stolen and his successors\nChurchill did the most than a man could do to counter that threat publicly and most visibly in Greece and in Fulton, Missouri\nNot a ... less important than this\nAnd his deeds and speeches or his writings above all his ... his book Marlboro the greatest historical ... work written in the last century and exhaust civil mine a political wisdom and understanding what should be required reading for every student of political science [noise]\nThe death of Churchill reminds us of the limitations of aircraft\nAnd there with our duty for we have no higher duty and no more pressing duty than to remind ourselves and our students of political greatness human greatness of the peaks of human excellence\nFor we are supposed to train ourselves and others and seeing things as they are and this means above all and seeing their greatness and their misery their excellence and they're violent is there no ability and their triumphs and therefore never mistake mediocrity however brilliant for true greatness\nIn our age this duty demands of us in the first place that we liberated ourselves from the supposition that value statements are not factual statements\nThat was Strauss son Churchill but the modern age knows and respects nothing of this or him let's take the astronaut Scott Kelly for a moment\nHe tweeted the other day a quote from Churchill and his liberal and left wing friends are followers hit back saying such things as such quotes from such men urban urban eats dignity or what we might call infrared did a good light and expression\nWho's origin is infrared dignity taught him or below ones dignity\nSo Kelly not knowing much about politics or rhetoric or rhetoric apologized on Twitter sort of he wrote quote did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities racist views\nWhich I Do not respect which I Do not support\nMy point was we need to come together as one nation we are all Americans should ... transcend partisan politics close quote offer someone whom ... admits it's ignorance maybe he ought to be a little slower to condemn that what she claims not to know about or who claims not to know about as a racist and committing atrocities\nWinston Churchill may be responsible for saving more lives than anyone in history without him truly without him Hitler would have overrun all of Europe and much more as what's his desire\nOf course having reduced Hitler to nothing worse than George Bush or Donald Trump too many young people and a lot of learned ignoramus is believing that analogy I actually heard a smart adult the other day saying it was Hitler asked to engage in illegal immigration family separations\nNot knowing how those separations have worked and their humanitarian efforts may be one thing\nBut it is entirely another to even suggest an equal par with separation of families that led to those families deliberate an orchestrated shoving them in ... which is what Hitler did as opposed to say returning those families to their home countries\nBoy can I think of twelve million people that would have wished Hitler merely separated families in order to move them to another country\nBut of course that begs the other idiocy of our age\nThe people in Germany and Poland and the Netherlands and so many other countries Hitler invaded and over and we're not immigrants legal or illegal they were nothing but perfectly fine longtime citizens who merely were of the wrong race or religion or mental capacity by the moral lights\nOf Hitler's science\nHitler separated families who are full citizens in order to slaughter them\nWe occasionally have separated families who made decisions to come here illegally when they were true families and smugglers to give their kids proper care and feeding us we process them to them meet most humanitarian immigration system in the world\nFar more humanitarian than say Mexico's take a look at their him immigration policies someday\nTruly take a look itll is down to you they have nothing to lecture us on but I digress Churchill he is the man we should be respecting thanking and memorializing not condemning\nThat we no longer question people's motives um where was any of that in the last two months we're was any of that it's nice that people clap when she said those ideals didn't die but do they even know what we're talking about do people even have the same nouns and adjectives anymore\nOkay that was one thing that just kind of stuck in my craw because all of that that was said about John McCain\nWas dead it was dead the last two weeks and they're really last three weeks with the
