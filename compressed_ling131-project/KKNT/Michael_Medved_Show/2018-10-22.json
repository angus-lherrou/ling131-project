affiliated voters so far in early voting according to the data dishes um this is pretty dramatic now look every one of those states except for Nevada\n... is a Republican say there's a state that the Trump carry some of them may carry built by a lot however he didn't necessarily do it with early voting but when you're talking about Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee in Texas [noise] those are all states that Trump\nCarried and uh however\nHe did these candidates in those states don't do do do better than Trump they just need to do as well and ah this would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage in the generic poll\nThe reasons that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would it's the same reason it didn't matter ultimately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California\nAnd that's the point one of the reasons I think that Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot there are thirty six seats where there is no Republican candidates\nReally where it's just so like I I don't think Maxine Waters has a Republican candidate against are there other seeds that are so dominated by the Democratic machine no Republican runs you know how many seats\nThere are no democratic candidates only three [noise] so when you take that factor out I think it's more even it is a horse race here\nIs I'm Nancy Pelosi was with Dana Bash and CNN in their citizen event which had a lot of political dignitaries and uh she was very very lavish with her praise of somebody she considers a great legislate tore listen\nIf Democrats do in the majority give any doubt that your colleagues will lead to house speaker again\nTo have any doubt well it's up to them to make that decision but I feel pretty comfortable laying on it because I fly south promoting it promotion is

[noise]\n[noise] so what's going on\nAnd on the other great day and the greatest nation on Don's green earth look in this room view of the future is sketched out in the New York times\nThe end of

Republican Party molded even more in the image of President Trump\nAnd these are among the plausible consequences if the Republicans sweets and mid term elections and keep control of both the house and Senate [noise] that's the speculation from David Leonhardt\nWhy well maybe it's to gin up a a democratic theft machine at least that's the allegation in a new book by Eric eggers it's a cold fraud it's about election fraud and he says we're in real danger of it will be speaking to him later this hour\n[noise] um meanwhile I also want to hear from why this election is so important in the mind of someone who was speaking in Las Vegas just moments ago and it's a voice you might recognize listen\nNovember's elections are more important than anything I can remember in my lifetime and that includes what I was on the ballot\nPoliticians say every corner of the most important election\nThe stakes are high [noise]\nThe consequences of anybody here not\nTurning up and doing everything you can get your friends neighbors family to turn up\nThe consequences of news saying home\nWould be profoundly dangerous to this come to our democracy\nOkay\nI I Can't believe that Obama President Obama is saying uh this is the most important election of my lifetime\nAnd again everyone says that about every election and it's almost never true [laughter] really [noise] and this is a midterm election and it will not be a landslide one way or the other\nAnd yes I think it's important and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the directions of the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential election and I think one of the things that happens\nIs we're all so desperate to get people to turn out and then went on election happens and there isn't some kind of profound change how people get disillusioned how often get new cry wolf about that stuff\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number a President Obama's successor was also speaking today and he had a a different tone he was speaking outside the White House and here's a President Trump said\nResolution [noise]\nSometimes we go we could have [noise]\nWe're giving [noise]\nSo every bit of that sort of the [laughter]\nTime to do both actually allowed\nOkay uh I'm not sure this is going to work\nAnd what he's talking about is trying to do a ten percent middle class income tax cuts sounds pretty good but honestly I don't I don't think he will get the support he needs unless a and\nFirst of all these right to say we're we're going to try to do the vote after the election what he's talking about now is a proposal to try to excite the Republican base in of course people should be excited about it to you know how much money you spend in taxes and getting ten\nPercent of that bag that's pretty cool that's a nice thing however\nHe can't do it honestly unless he finds some kind of compensating\nA place for money to come in\nBecause it it simply does not work it does not work when you cut the tax rate\nThat automatically the revenues go up I mean it's true that the revenues didn't go down from the last tax hike but because we're spending so much more than ... continue to grow up we're already looking at a trillion dollar a year deficit\nAnd I think the president should a work as far as he can maybe after the election with a Republican House and a Republican Senate to try to yes continue to cut taxes\nBut to do so by cutting spending one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or in Nevada President Trump spoke on Saturday and he was talking and somewhat similar terms listen\nReal if they are in fact for middle income\nThat it'll be sometimes I Wish I had are setting the right cell around the block for young people not at all and he's working on it [noise]\nAll right we're all we're you know\n\nI wouldn't say some time around for maybe a little bit before the\nOkay one of the things that we need to keep in mind is they're already was a tax cut for middle income people you may not be aware of it but you will when you fill out your tax forms and everything because basically the exemption\nWas doubled in other words part of what we have now is that the standard deduction the standard deduction that people receive\nWas doubled which means that there's an extra twelve thousand dollars that people who are middle class taxpayers are not paying taxes on\nThat's the thing and that should save a lot of money all ready for middle income people and uh I I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump does something that provoked a huge Lee negative response on CNN [noise] what's striking about this is not the light it sheds 'cause she has no light at all on President Trump's proposed actions concerning the federal government\nAnd trans gender is ...\nWhat's shocking about it is supposedly journalism and honestly these reporters on air uh are sounding completely an unapologetically partisan I'm Talking about John\nBerman and um [noise] and I'll Alison Colorado and a John Avalon on uh CNN listen to how they react\nRemember it was just over three years ago that same sex marriage became legal in this country\nSo now the wedge issue has moved to trans right and conservative so I'd love to mock the issue of identity gender identity civilized by Facebook's dozens of gender options\nI won't somewhat rules abrasive myriad of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect\nRepublicans want to benefit from this backlash and it's an easy target just look at the numbers transgender folks make up an estimated zero point four percent of American adults work once when I saw a million people\nThat's still a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than the millions of gay and lesbian Americans who most people now know was friends family your co workers\nAnd it's just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination was a pretty basic American values rooted in freedom and equality\nWell President Trump has also been playing up the caravan of asylum seekers from Central America pushing it as a threat at rallies and tweets with plenty of amplification from conservative media this is just more play the bass panic rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the border\nOkay there let's say they don't rush to the border\n[noise] what are they coming here to do they're they're coming here in Moscow to get into the United states and what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum\nAnd basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a ... basically the core of our sovereignty gets to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't\nWe don't get to decide because we're not East Germany who leaves the country and people are free to leave\nBut this is this is bizarre this is um and we have that can we go to this last uh ... uh we don't have time okay ah I ah I Know we will be speaking about this later frankly what\nThat that's exactly right there was I think that the election it'd been settled by around three hundred vote and it wasn't until a couple of years later unfortunately what they discovered more than a thousand votes by I think spelling and people that shouldn't have been voting so that's a that's a very prominent example and by the way before\nAl Franken went on to become the sixtieth vote in the Senate\nSo anytime people ask well what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look you're a ride and insurance premiums because Africa is actually became the vote that locked in Obamacare are in New Hampshire and toys sixteen New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting they have what's called the intent to reside law\nSo and I write about this in the book that the Democrats ... state of New Hampshire bill Gardner even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of try to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire the senator from New Hampshire Kelly ... she ended up losing by one thousand votes\nIn twenty sixteen well they had six thousand people register to vote on the same day in New Hampshire and they had these buses that come in from Massachusetts the neighboring states six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or take the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire residents\nSo those are a couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think\nThat document example you've got mayor's races you've got sheriff traces of the sheriff's rate\nIn Florida that uh it's basically been proven that they've had felons that voted illegally but because the elections basically been certified or the ... the judge has ruled that well we have to give these fellows due process though that's not enough evidence for invalidate\nThough it happened a nationally\nDon't change would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because I think it really get down to the blowout in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida and\nI've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the the reality is the bias is to let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter but\nBecause of that it's created a system of vulnerabilities\nThat I think are actively exploited by bad actors\nSo I mean the the Texas Democrats mailing the the voter registration forms is one example but you know you got groups like acorn ... and their whole job is to go out and Ralph's up as many voters as possible regardless of the legality of those voters right you've got\nVoted I I Know one ... one of the same way one singer\nOne of the things that people seem to be a interested in on the left as the idea that if you're a college student do you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice the national legal but that happens a lot doesn't\nAbsolutely I mean there's nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country or the Supreme Court side of the few that are specific that says twenty four million voter registrations this country are completely wrong so that's one an eight\nBy the way that we know we've got massive problem and then the question is will how easily are they exploited\nAnd you say you have to watch that we are going to face in just a moment with Eric Eyre eggers whose new book fraud how the left plans to seal the next election it's posted up at our website\nThe question that we're going to ponder is what do you do about it how can it be fixed how can we be protected we'll get to that and more with Eric eggers whose new book is called fraud\nHow the left plans to steal the next election will be right back on the met that show\nMichael ... Michael ... dot com\n[noise] nice sixty no\nOreo con Democrats are to blame for a caravan of well over five thousand now Central American migrants heading towards the United states\nTrump tweeted the

how the left plans to steal the next election and fraud appears with say an introduction which is excellent by Peter Schweitzer who worked with Eric eggers on a previous number one best selling book\nCalled Clinton Cash it's really\nAbove said the change the world and at least change the direction of the campaign uh Eric ... before the break we were talking about some of the numbers in your book twenty four million just wrong registrations among people around the country\nIs incredibly easy to uh to commit voter fraud if people are motivated to do it so what do we do to make our elections more secure\nIt's a great question and it's one that states around the country have grappled with at times so um we saw how close the election with a twin sixteen in Ohio and you mentioned that at the outset so it's important to note that Ohio is done I think basically followed a template that other states would be wise to do it they\nAre taking steps to start removing would be illegal voters from the voter rolls and uh they required an ID I also think by the way it's instructive and this is part of why the subtitle is how the left queens to steal the next election because they talk about how George Soros and Tom ... is head of the Democratic party\nEssentially fund efforts to both keep the voter rolls inaccurate and therefore elections insecure and then ... and then fund groups like acorn of the Roberts and exploit those vulnerability\nBut the state of Ohio had to fight source for the effort to do both those things right it was a Supreme Court decision was five to four but allow them to continue to make sure that the people on the voter rolls were legal voters\nSee this is a very very important thing to keep in mind because when you think about cases like this a lot of people think well it's a matter of there's a conflict between two people and the government is sort of leaning on one side\nIs not a conflict between two private citizens it's a conflict between a private citizen\nAnd an interfering bullying intruding government in this case the state attorney general\nAnd thank goodness alliance defending freedom has won a lot of these skirmishes and they're

Mr Trump's already acceptance from the Saudi explanation that Mr ... was killed accidentally and a fistfight rather than orchestrated hit ordered by the Saudi royal court suggests how he plans to ride

I'm assuming some more will\nCome to know that a fact\nWe've talked about it here before and a lot there's a lot of it the distraction affect the constant state of agitation the no safe spaces from politics the permanent revolution if you will\nBut know what the revolutions base is it's a base of race it's constantly pushing the narrative that the GOP or the Republican Party or the conservative movement is all about a master race and preserving that master race look at Charles blows up at in the New York times today\nWould I truly don't know is whether he believes what he writes or not that is a serious question on my part I I don't know if he's a fool around have\nBut he writes the following Trump is campaigning as if it were quote white as if the quote white people's control of the country is in danger and under assault\nAnd must be defended and prosecuted at all costs protective sorry protected at all costs why would Charles Blow say or write or think that easy answer a lot of the left keeps writing and saying and thinking that why do they\nDoes it come with any evidence whatsoever [noise]\n[noise] I was hoping never to do this but here goes\nWith someone wanting to maintain something like the white people's control of this country have is this representative to the world has UN ambassador a woman of Indian descent what do you have as a surgeon general his lead spokesmen on public health an African American or black man\nWhat a secretary of housing and urban development and one of the two agencies most connected with managing issues of poverty beheaded by another African American or black man\nWould he have an Arab American as a secretary of health and Human Services the other agency dealing with issues having to do with poverty or an Asian American woman as a secretary of transportation\nDoes the narrative of a white people's control of this country come with any evidence whatsoever with a racist tolerate any of the above\nMuch less a point them much less love and promote promote love children who converted to orthodox Judaism but notice how Charles Blow of the New York times get to solve here\nHe continues to write quote but rather than ever using words like white supremacy white nationalism he uses proxies like law and order border walls and infestation\nWell let's stop a moment because infestation while not a racist term per se does claim some bells so who was Donald Trump referring to I looked up that quote I forgot it I remember when I looked it up\nBut he was referring to well no he was explicit lead using that word to speak of MS Thirteen gang members he called them investors\nGino who or what MS Thirteen is or does\nWell let me ask would it be better or worse to call the MS Thirteen an infestation or say panic\nWhat's worse say panic or infestation I asked because of relatively recent Washington Post article not all bad but article was titled MS their teens say panic history and a detailed the one of many examples of their crimes or I might just say methods\nQuote from the Washington Post the victim had been stabbed over one hundred times decapitated dismembered and his heart had been exercised from his chest and thrown into a great close quote\nYes infestation by such animals is probably if anything to weaker term so that's how Charles Blow portrays Trump racism use of the word infestation to describe something out of the temple of doom but worse and real\nThen Charles Blow the New York times writes quote any now wants to cast liberals and Democrats as mobs saying Democrats produce mobs while Republicans produce jobs will\nCount me among the mob if that means people who stand in opposition to Trump's degradation of the country and always close quote [noise] always blow writes\nIf the mob stands up for women and stands up to the national Rifle Association I Want it and if the mob hates corruption and loves the increasing diversity of this country than it is for me close quote he does not know\nWhat he's talking about or what Republicans are talking about\nWe're talking about violence the violence that leads to include shooting at Republicans shoving Republicans or other protesters throwing projectiles at them antifa rioters\nThat's what we're talking about\nI suppose I suppose blow could be joining\n... joining that if all in all ways as the standard for protest here if he truly thinks that that's what protests should be put something tells me he's missed tend the leftist missed something really big\nYou see I think as I think we all think revolution is justified in certain institutions see the declaration of independence for cross references oh heck\nI'll do a forum we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed\nThat whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to Institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness\nPrudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are suffer rubble\nMentor right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed\nSo what's interesting here to ask is what just what form of government has become destructive of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness [noise]\nTo the degree that argument can be made it can be made by may be some in the conservative community and indeed the fuse it used to be a fairly standard trope of\nThe left but the radical or separatist right is what was to be feared in this country but what has been their effect none\nSo why else might have group resort to violence or ...\nWell the eradication maybe even the curbing of civil liberties quick question a person is less free to speak or right today or over the past two years ... make it over the past ten years only one kind of person the conservative\nHe is who was banned on the college campus or violently attacked he is who was censored on social media\nIndeed so free as the left to operate in this country as it should be that Michael Moore just released a feature movie but there is the exact Rob\nIt doesn't have purchased the movies a flop people aren't seeing it because they aren't buying it just like Hillary Clinton just like the rest of the left wing agenda of hypocrisy power just because you don't like an election does not mean you get to be far inland\nJust because you don't like an election to the point the violence means you are the separatists you are the ones who despises your fellow countrymen and as it must be a few despise your fellow countrymen you have to despise your country\nJust because people don't agree with you does not give you the right to violence something we thought we all would have learned before the first grade\nThat is of course unless you are a fascist or a communist who rules by that power of muscle\nAnd gun of course those two are the ones who divide us by claims of race so the shoe just makes it\n[noise] but you know you cannot claimed to love the symbols of American democracy or any form of democracy is thriving of such and boys a thriving if you want to put her to center with means that are violent\nPropaganda arm of the Democratic National Committee\nThat's what we have\nWe have there is some Fox new gets higher ratings political stuff you know than anyone including the network news organization [noise]\nYeah well yeah no I Do I just I'm Wondering are people looking at this caravan you know even through the eyes are lens I should say the lens of the ah dysfunctional media put it in your phrase [noise] um are people looking at this and saying I'm\nBoy we we really need to relax our borders [noise]\nWell I I I think science says yeah you know I just got done with my son was warning once once on okay and discussion over there regarding rocks man he was like my son is ... okay uh-huh\n[laughter] he was the question what this does some guy\nMaybe the following statement out how\nHow can these people\nAre just want to stop people from trying to better their lives\nBe so selfish and like myself I\nUnderstand what you're saying you know how can these people walk better their lives now and they're not selfish but these people want to keep it alive lives better and don't want it\nWorse there are selfish yeah and I said\nBut doing that argument is used every day on CNN and MSNBC and ABC\nMhm [noise] and he's like wash [laughter]\n\nHow can we be so cool not allow anybody who wants to come into this country to come into this got\nIn any way anyone [laughter] okay [laughter]\nAnd then in the same breath say you can't disparage the countries that are coming from a wonderful country they're not as holes yeah yeah [laughter] yeah they're fleeing from\nThis always reminds me this point you know my buddy Chris Buskirk makes a really good point about this part of the argument which is um when we do\nRelax our borders or immigration policy or however you want to put it in this discussion uh two people are fleeing or coming from these countries voluntarily or otherwise\nUm does anyone ever stop and think about the consequences to that originating country does anyone ever stop and think about what it means to be quote unquote strip mining these countries that need the best and the brightest [noise] um\n[noise] you know what is the turnaround policy for these countries that yeah you might put an ass in front of a whole the whole the thought bill can I I'm going to a break and can I come back to you on the other side\nSome great thanks feel I really appreciate it marked don't go away I Want to hear from you too and we still
