away the worry knowing that your retirement money is safe and growing\nCalled eight four four three seven one seven to three three\nWe've talked about how the real risk of exposure to the markets\nIsn't discussed in the media or by brokerage houses we use no market strategies based on specialized plans that can provide first year returns of up to ten percent or more plus they include contractual guarantees that you'll never suffer a loss because of the stock market decline\nWhile at the same time you'll be locking in your annual gains\nAnd also remember no fees are loads are taken from your deposit\nThe message here is different from what you normally hear on the financial planning show largely because they're concepts are different most brokers based their financial planning on something called modern portfolio theory this theory basically divided up your money and puts it into different investment categories another word for this is diversification\nThe process of diversification is supposed to minimize your losses if the market drops\nOne thing that's rarely talked about though is that it also limits your games when the market goes up\nWe have a better idea what if you could participate in some of the market gains without participating in any market losses\nOur emphasis is on preservation of your principal participation in market gains in a lifetime of income that you cannot outlive we help you set up a retirement that you can be sure of\nMarkets always retest new lows but when the markets go into the next dive it won't matter to you once you've

up an income account the compounds that up to seven percent per year this account can be used to guarantee you that you'll never outlive your retirement money\nYou see when you suffer a loss in the market\nEven if it's a small loss you have three problems the lost value is just one problem the second problem is the time it takes to make that that loss\nBut the third problem is is it's almost impossible for you to regain your losses let me explain if\nYou have a market exposed account of a hundred thousand dollars and the market drops by thirty percent\nYour town has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful right but that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the following year by thirty percent do you think you're back to your original hundred thousand the real answer is absolutely not now why not\nIt's the cruel math of losses here's why after dropping thirty percent the account is at Seventy thousand\nSo the thirty percent gain and the following year on the way back up his gain on only Seventy thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand there's only Twenty one thousand and when you add the Twenty one to the Seventy that's left over it's only Ninety One thousand\nSo the real math is that it would take a forty three percent gain just to get back to where we started which was a hundred thousand\nNow this problem gets even harder to recover from if you're taking income during retirement imagine what would happen if you take an income out on top of the loss\nThat's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my list is is is when does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero then the answer when you lose thirty percent of the market it takes me forty three percent again just to get back to zero\nThings may apply

specialist for save money one have you ever asked yourself\nWhat's the purpose of money when I asked my list there's what's the purpose of money\nI get all kinds of answers one of my listeners answered by telling me that he wanted his money to grow is that the purpose of money to grow everyone wants to money to grill just like nobody wants to lose their money but growth is just a function of money not a purpose\nI'm going to let you in on a big secret I'm going to tell you the purpose of money and I promise that you've never heard anybody tell you like this before I Do now it'd be a

for a lifetime of income that you cannot outlive call now and ate for for three seven one safe again\nThat's paid for for three seven one seven to three three\n[noise] so what is the purpose of money it's very simple yet profound if you understand what I'm about to explain you could live out your retirement with way less stress more confidence and more comfort than you ever thought possible\nThere's actually two purposes for money only to no more no less\nBut first purpose is life and the second purpose is yeah\nI bet you've never heard it that way before I'm sure everyone you listen to or ticket advice from his always tried to tell you about growing your money which ever told you about the purpose of money so what does that mean a purpose for life for a purpose for death\nWhen I say that one purpose for money is life I mean you're going to use that money while you're alive\nIn our business we call that income\nNo matter how you look at it if you spend the money during your lifetime you're taking income from that money for the purpose of life\nWhen I say that another purpose for money is death that means you're planning on leaving that money behind we call that a legacy in other words you're going to pass that money on your heirs after you're gone\nIt's critical that your financial planner understands the importance of creating strategies for both the purpose of life and death\nSome strategies work better for income and others work better for legacy the ideal strategy though allows you to maximize your income now while protecting your legacy just in case you don't live as long as you hope to\nThat's why you should call me now and aid for for three seven one save that hey for for three seven one seven to three three we specialize in no market strategies they'll provide you with the maximum benefit for life or death\nYou can call now are needed a week they pick up a copy of our free hundred plus page safe money book it's over a hundred pages of everything your broker doesn't want you to know\nTall eight four four three seven one safe that's eight four four three seven one seven to three three\nSo like I said there are only two purposes for money spending the money while you're alive or leaving the money to those left behind\nBy far the most significant purpose of money it's income it's one thing not to leave money into your beneficiaries but it's a disaster if you outlive your money\nIn fact studies show that outliving retirement money is actually more feared than death for many people\nNow is the purpose of your money is life there are only two plans for that purpose once called the plan for death than the others called the plan for life if you have a broker a financial planner that isn't an expert in plans for life meaning guaranteed income for life then I'm certain you're on a plan for death\nWhat is a plan for death when it comes to your retirement income well here it is\nYou save up your money you invested in something that provides a hypothetical non guaranteed ready to return it has market risk or it's a short term guaranteed ready to return in other words you have no guarantee for a long term growth you might hope\nSeven percent compound a growth but after fees market downturns rate aspirations and so forth you have no idea what kind of return you're going to get\nIn fact you don't even know if you're going to get any return because the next two thousand they market draw might be just around the corner\nTraditional planning says you you save up your money hoping that grows and then at some point in time he decided to retire or you start to draw income from those accounts how much do you draw all four percent three percent or do you just drop the amount you need and hope for the best\nThe problem with this plan is that your hypothetical growth has combined with an arbitrary spend down there'll be retirement accounts and you have no idea if the plan is going to work because you don't know how long you're going to live\nAnd you don't know when the market will have another correction if you die sooner than you thought you spent two little if you live longer than you thought you'd probably run out of money before you die\nIn order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to plan on dying by a certain age what fun is that\nThat's what I recall that kind of plan a plan for doubt\nYou want to plan for dying or plan for a living\nIn a second I'm going to tell you about a plan for life and if you want to find out specifically how no market risk plan for life would apply to your retirement call me right now and I can show you a better way to live\nA way towards a lifetime income account that isn't wasted away by fees or market declines that comes

E. R. which is a clear and candid looking at how electing a president directly affects the Supreme Court and the nation for generations\nThe last book that he ... that was published on his behalf and his co author of\nJeb Bush a former President Bush's brother George W rather a published in two thousand and Thirteen tackled the immigration argument both for legal and illegal immigration a\nLittle bit more about justice but like in two thousand and three\nAmerican Lawyer magazine named him one of the three lawyers of the year in two thousand and nine legal times magazine included him and their list of than Ninety Ninety nine zero greatest Washington\nLawyers of the past Thirty years\n\nI Would say without a doubt we have the right man with us today and with that we're talking about other things in a minute but with that or I welcome you back to main street out loud your honor justice ...\nRudy thank you so much for such a generous introduction it's great to be back with you and on main street\nAbsolutely All right now I I I Want to get started because we have lots of questions and some are linked day but\nNevertheless these are things that\nFor weeks on and the main street Americans have been asking but they're not getting answers\nFirst one deals with power\nIt seems to be the only goal of the parties in Washington DC\nJust to obtain power and it's the wrangler ...\nThose uh bt into their party that Russell up that power by campaigning and being elected\nThe confirmation hearing process of a judge Kavanaugh now justice Kavanaugh or you know soon to be has been about power pure and simple\n\nIf all it's all about the power to have like\nMinded judges judges that seemed to lean towards one agenda over another on the bench\nSo here's the question if judges no matter the level\nI Would say certainly in the higher car it's like you're like that which you said on or our United States Supreme Court if judges are nominated based on their qualifications regarding the law\nJudicial attributes and they are then sworn to follow the letter of the law\nAs they normally a test they do which is the constitution the United states of America then what does all the bickering about\nAnd why such a partisan atmosphere as we have just witnessed or\nIs the real truth then it's really not about the constitution\n[laughter] [noise] well I think it it it really is about the constitution or there's so many ways to answer that really excellent question but I'm\nJust think about when the last nomination was that a vote this type of intense hostility was Justice Clarence Thomas\nOr a politics fade into the woodwork and you decide the case or based on the lawn facts so I think he'll be able to to to do that um but but some of the things that he said he has admitted were in temperate\nUm and I think only time will heal that but I'm confident that time will heal that because he's got a track record as a judge I don't agree with all of his decisions but he's an outstanding judge and that's why he was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nSo I think that those are those issues those concerns will subside overtime\nLast time we uh we had such a close vote today fifty forty eight was a over the seating of your friend or Justice Clarence Thomas to the bench and that vote was fifty two to forty eight a again Republicans\nWere in their majority and as far as the Senate goes\nSo with today's vote Fifteen to forty eight I'm Sorry yes fixated party eight\nRepublicans and the majority compared to other votes in recent years\n\nFrom Garcia Tron backed eighties and nineties uh you know four and a few dissenting or a holding out boats\nIs there an explanation\nOver such a division\nUnlike when Democrats are in the majority and things seemed to go smoke in a while when it comes to injustices ... seems to be smoother\nRudy I think ah when Thomas was there I think it was a Democratic majority 'cause I I seem to remember\n... sorry ... writing on us and that actually\nUnderscores even more how much things have changed or because if this was a Democratic majority there's no question that Brett Kavanaugh would not be being sworn in um [noise] but this is a\nYou know this is a dramatic change and I actually think it's a a change on on both sides of of the political divide\nWe're seeing fifty one to forty nine votes on court of appeals nominations that used to be\nYou know ... voice votes or Ninety One to uh to sex this has been a a a really sudden change you know you look back at Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Sam Alito both right and left\nYou know you you just did not see these close votes but the judiciary is becoming so politicized that um [noise]\nUh that I Am really concerned\nThat by any time there is divided government between the president and the Senate We're going to see things come to a complete and screeching halt and a ... a while ago there was a grand bargain um and I think this was during the Bush administration\nOr where the there was an agreement you know we're we're going to confirm X number of judges you know and and move that the process along [noise]\nI'm not sure there there is anyone who would stitched together that kind of that kind of process right now so you know if the Democrats a win a majority in the Senate\nAh this this November or or if a President Trump is succeeded by a Democrat and there's a Republican Senate\nI I really fear for the judicial nomination process can we need to fill the spots but yeah\nAnd ah so I don't I don't know where where the compromise comes from but the the system is toxic it's and\nIt's a it's it's it's going to to grind our system to to halt [noise] and I fear that it may ah radicalized the judiciary is as well because uh uh people will be chosen because of uh of their political philosophies\nAnd focus will be right back or with a more and you're listening or main street ... to\n... attended the debut of an artist work at a
