top doc in twenty Thirteen\nOne of her passions is promoting international awareness of breast cancer especially in countries such as India she has coauthored publications and a book chapter and his certified by the American board of surgery I welcome back Dr more the\nI think yeah All right\nSo as I mentioned at the beginning of the program today's topic treatment of late stage breast cancer disease\nLet's start off with\nThe beginning doctor Murthy give us the medical definition in terms of course of late stage or locally advanced breast cancer\nSayre says that the ... early stage breast cancer where there where this is diagnosed usually on a mammogram and it's not felt or a very small lump\nIn the sand or locally advanced breast cancer has features such as it is very large a perhaps over five centimeters has evidence that it spread to several months now than they are pet or soft tissues above and below the collar bone or to other tissues around the brass such as the skin and muscle\nAnd so it's important to make this kind of a diagnosis said that we can tailor the treatment ... to that individual\nAnd not there I Would say subgroup of inflammatory yeah as a locally advanced breast cancer is inflammatory breast cancer which is a rapidly growing type of cancer where the presentation is that the that you may or may not feel alone that the press appears red and swollen hence the term inflammatory\nCell it is a specific type of locally advanced breast cancer with unique symptoms are such as that skin thickening and swelling\nIs inflammatory breast cancer is that visually apparent\nYes says women will present with what\nAlmost A L I oftentimes confused with math site is and so they'll come in and saying you know what just pay recently my ... warm read it's swollen\nAnd they may or may not be a ... a lot of times when they do to their primary care physician they'll get placed on antibiotics thinking that it is an infection but there's no response to that antibiotics so\nThey well hopefully after after you know a couple of weeks have no response will get a mammogram and then be referred to a Mac oncologist or a surgeon\nSurgery is an option or\nIs not an option normally a front where where does that fall and\nSo if you think about locally advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer it if it's helpful to think about it in this way that there's a lot of humor burden there a lot of humor ... [noise]\nAnd so if we were to take that person to surgery there is a very high chance we would not get out all the cancer south and in climate very\nInflammatory or in locally advanced disease and so one of the big advantages for daily Neil ... therapy or therapy prior to surgery that affects the whole body is to reduce the volume of tumor cells that have to be removed so\nWith inflammatory breast cancer surgery certainly is an option but after you're controlling the disease are shrinking the volume of disease that is president if you can shrink something then it's much easier to remove so\nIt is possible to do surgery for someone who has inflammatory breast cancer after they've undergone ... think chemotherapy to control the disease\nThe surgical option is mastectomy so there's really no other option so for example with\nThe cancer that may be very large but it's not inflammatory that person's still may be in a candidate to keep their breast however since inflammatory breast cancer has characteristics that it actually involves the skin um\nWe don't we don't get people that option of saving their breath it has to be a mastectomy\nWhen it comes to\nCancer tumors and breast are there some forms of cancer that are sicker than others in other words there is a mass tumors amass whether it\nBe widespread or to me as a layperson or deeper\nInto the tissue itself is is there one that is\nIs is greater\nAnd and mass type of cancer or is it just any breast cancer or cancer that isn't treated\n\nSo it depends on the pathology they are tumors like ... or breast cancer that it's a bit tricky it has little arms and you can go up through the ... a deeper and and the precedents NATO was picked up by by mammogram\nOr so at some point I was getting at so if you have a lump and you feel a lump but yet you're mammogram as negative a piece called back to your doctor because it could be something like level or cancer that as it can be missed by a mammogram\nOr whether that be duty or three\nOr three D. if it's available because ah three I mean you can also be mesmerized by it can be missed by a treaty art art factual going to take a quick break but we'll be right back with more from a doctor Kato Dr tannahill and back or more the [noise]\nIf you follow them and straight out loud you know we go with the facts delivers address some way to do it in plain English\nSo let me put this as plain as I can\nWe want you to advertise on main street out loud if you're listening soldier customer base if you appreciate details over soundbites if you prefer unbiased commentary over party loyalties spin and if you want exposure for your products and services then it's time to get in touch\nIsn't it time just spread your wings email us at advertise that may straight out loud dot com\nHi I'm a camera and I'm not a commercial spokes person but I Am certainly qualified to bring this message to thousand eleven I was a twenty five year old graduate student working towards my masters when my life changed forever I'd found a lump in one of my brass\nWith no genetic history of having a gut feeling that something wasn't right high medical opinion after diagnostic testing I was diagnosed with stage three invasive breast cancer\nAfter chemo surgery reconstruction and radiation today five years later I and I can't say Congress\nFrom the beginning I had in my opinion the best medical practitioner and great support team as a patient navigator\nComprehensive breath center of Arizona I Want you to know you are not alone have carrying experts we take the journey with you with five locations throughout the valley contact us six zero to three seven four three four four zero\nI cannot fix the roads to\nThree seven four three for for the euro for online on aids the breast center dot com\nHigh special routing gay if you're listening today and like what you hear why not drop us ally and give us your thoughts if you're listening and don't like what you're hearing why not drop us a line and tell us what you think\nMay straight out loud isn't about me it's about you view and the others that live and work on the main streets all across America\nThis country needs to you speak up we want to hear from you send us an email to talk of Maine straight out loud dot com so often but for people go to an automobile dealerships to purchase a vehicle they question themselves have asked themselves how well they know\nHow well they know if if they're getting a good deal if they're buying the ride vehicle so getting all the options they want and the warranty covers this and that\nIf this is you maybe I can help if you purchased one of the technologically advanced fuel efficient super equipped vehicles that offer models to fit every lifestyle and made\nAnd you're going to take my suggestion and visit ...
