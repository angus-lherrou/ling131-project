I Believe when you say can or can't you\nCan do whatever you want it is a free country but there are consequences and right now there is a very different sense about a white person dressing up as a black person by putting black makeup on then it would be the other way around here would be one little point of advice I don't think anybody would\nMind if you just left off the skin makeup\nRight if he wanted to dress up like a Bob Marley oh we had a caller who apparently dressing up as Bob Marley or you want to dress up as a Freddy Mercury Freddy Mercury was of Persian ancestry and yeah it's somewhat darker skin\nAnd okay so you want to mess up as for Freddie Mercury dress up as Freddie Mercury of the uh of\nQueen but don't put makeup on your skin because it is that the whole process of darkening your skin usually in a comical way because if you look at some of the classic black pays performers they don't look\nConvincingly black it's not like Jimmy Kimmel Robert Downey junior and recent films are type TV shows that we're talking about\nIt's like a cartoon it's a shoe polish it's it's it's black black not dark brown\nLet us go to your calls and to um Pete in shoreline Washington ... you're on the med show\nYes or Michael how are you doing I'm doing well\nUm I agree with you the Megan Kelly may not have been the um [noise] she was not the poster child for conservative views but um she does have the right to say where she had to say is a First Amendment right um but it\n... and she has an Amendment rights lawyer I'm with it [noise] [noise] yes that's right you you you you have freedom of speech but you do not have freedom of consequences and look do I think that this whole thing is a little bit of an overreaction with Megan Kelly is passing comments I Do\nAnd I feel for her with that regard but she\nEat she could have been quicker on this and certainly more effective it seems to me in responding to it let 'em\nGo to a Brian in Schanberg Illinois Brian you're on the ... disagree Monday\nAfternoon hey listen to you to you a lot and you get away with a lot of slippery language and one of the while I'm calling about today is ... years spots for a Mac he made the point that seniors are getting what they paid for which is not true they're getting a lot more than they paid for that's\n... that's absolutely true and I don't know that average\nFor every dollar senior puts it put into Medicare they're getting three dollars back\nAlright ... what I said I don't I don't believe that I have said that that seniors are just getting back what they paid for I Am saying that they are are listed in a program and part of a program to which they've contributed for many many years\nAnd they have but what you're saying oh by the way doesn't work for all seniors on every senior who gets back more than he pays for but particularly seniors who are lower income so they paid in less to the Medicare system are getting a lot more back\nThat's true so I'm not sure where our disagreement is here\nYou see no applied it only getting what you pay for but in reality I went on an average on average at my right back a lot more than they paid in\nAdult social wired and on Social Security as well which is one of the reasons and by the way do you know why they get back so much more\n[noise] because medical costs you\nKnow it's actually 'cause our life expectancy keeps going up than in other words Social Security used to pay for itself because the life expectancy was sixty seven say only had to provide Social Security payments for people for an average of two years and uh now our life expectancy is almost Seventy seven\nSo it's very very different and much much more difficult\nTo make the uh the numbers workout but your point is fair enough ah we we all do get more back from both Social Security Medicare than we pay and but at least we pay in something and when people talk about Medicare for all they're talking about people getting payments who put in\nNothing not anything at all let's go to a Steven born in Pennsylvania you're on them at that show\nUp or down in New Jersey Michael Oh okay great um I\nI'm a white male drug being average old ... ... am I right that [noise]\nAnd quickly relatively quickly after a couple of years yeah but\nThe point is that today the life expectancy because of medical advances people who get aids it's not a death sentence every\nTime it's changed and simply look I'm a ... at Magic Johnson is still very much alive and\nUm I don't know how his Dodgers and I'm not sure there that much alive but that's different\nUh at the point about this is there are reasons and I think the reasons have to do with these free market and the power of the free market\nThat America really has led the world in ... medical discoveries and improving the science of medicine over the last fifty years and yes I Do think that the profit motive has something to do with it for the companies and and the medical institutions that are developing this material and these cures\nLet's go quickly to Ronnie in Beverly Hills California Ronnie you're on the mad that show\nBlack Americans are laughing at you and corporate America for this type of a thing about the black trade in black people are not upset about this the only people talking about this or individual like yourself for example\nAh NBC or using this black race thing to get out of a contract or anything like a professional basketball corporations using the N. word and things like that to get out of a contracting using dog could get out of a\nA multi million dollar contract with Michael Vick for example a black people are tired of the\nWay way way way ... hold on hold on hold on for a moment\nDo you think that uh that that they put Michael Vick in prison only because they want us to get out of a contract\nAbsolutely there are no evidence or I mean let's go back oh come on things that go back\nTo the ... he he's even acknowledge that he was guilty what he was charged with and he went to Portland for I think almost two years maybe more than they were\nThere were there was no evidence there but I Want to argue with you\nBut you're you're ... your basic point is\nLook I'm\nMission hire at is like\nPeople were being used it is my ... my basic point by people like yourself\nHow am I using black people here out how am I I'm not responsible for fire on an ... or\nOther professional to you you do that on a daily basis\nOkay tell me how how\nDo you use the energy of black people this thing is not a racist issue most\nPeople I agree with you and I said that consistently but what I you just made the accusation that I use the energy of about black people and so now misuse it what are you talking about\nFor example are people in the world as black in them if you go by time study from years and years and years ago it demonstrates the origin\nOf location or their every All right I Am I I I understand in those genetic studies will show that I may well be every bit as black as a Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee but go ahead\nSo so so why couldn't somewhat express themselves into all the way in God's do\nPeople can and will which just do it and it's going to be counterproductive I don't think that it will dressing in a Halloween costume and going in blackface means that you're a racist I Know people\nHave done that and they're not racist but I I think it's extraordinarily foolish\nTo do it today and to try to defend it because there is such a thing as history and this is a\nAn extremely depressing history I'm Ben Shapiro wrote a piece it was was very good on this issue where he actually put up a clip from 'em and\nAn old on musical comedy that showed what the black face really was like and looking at that reality and confronting that reality is part of our history and that seems to me it's worthwhile but people come to terms with it\nAnd meanwhile you can continue to come to

settlers about fourth of them in Connecticut\nA than any other war any of it when the film was found America to the Native Americans turn them away went hungry immigrants came to our nation that our government shown them\nA after Nineteen twenty four yes\nUh and when the Israelites were wandering through the desert didn't the Canaan nights not welcome [laughter] check your Bible or there were no gain that ice emphatically did not welcome them and that is why there were some very bloody struggles in that regard\nAnd um it didn't work out so well for the game tonight or who by the way we're and historians confirmed this is not only the biblical account they were child sacrifices they practiced human sacrifice they burn babies alive\nOr so not such a level folks and by the way you want to have an ancient Canaan nights welcomed with open arms into the United states\nOr you were a six sorry son of a B and you need help science Sally in San Francisco well thank you for helping me with a segment we've talked about this earlier in the show\nA look I think it is perfectly appropriate for people to have personal compassion\nFor some of the people who are in that caravan and no I don't think they're all terrorists and I don't think they all mean or evil for the United states\nBut it is you simply cannot say that the country is going to be wide open to a every single human being in the world who is hungry are starving or facing violence are facing a difficult situation it's billions of people\nAnd that is not fair to the people who have lived here who themselves or their families have contributed to the United states\nI look what what has to happen with a caravan particularly\nThis is a test and\nIf the Democrats really want us to say oh come on and you six thousand or seven thousand or ever many they are\nThen what do you say to the next caravan was already starting Guatemala\nThe truth of the matter is I Do believe President Trump is wrong to say well we should cancel foreign aid to El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala what we should do is say look let's work together on this and we will provide more of that foreign aid to keep the people there\nAnd for the people who are going to be sent back from the caravan you don't have to say well you're going to be sent back to a hopeless situation\nSend them back with some private organizations or some Christian organizations some do good organizations that will help them get set up so they don't have to live under such squalid conditions\nAre back in Honduras or back in Guatemala with the other caravan but the the answer and I haven't heard of single Democrats say this\nBut that's the implication if everyone who is needy and helpless and a destitute and desperate has an open door in the United states what does that mean to our population\nAnd what does that mean for the people who are here already\nAnd Joanne from Los Angeles wrote in\nEr during the disagreements segment last week you mentioned how the right to not generally harassed groups of politicians as the left is prone to do\nI remember the Tea Party people disrupting rallies and far right groups in Charlottesville et cetera okay the Tea Party people were not disrupting rallies what she's talking about is they came to town meetings a constituent meetings that were held by congressman to try to\nGet their attention and\nThe left does this too that it seems to me is not is not hateful when people come and you have against ... meeting with a member of Congress what I'm Talking about as the eye the effort to shut down people and not allow them to speak\nThis on college campuses is uniquely the left when it comes to interrupting congressional hearings uh when it comes to and you might say well what about these bombs we don't know about the bombs right now we don't\nBut it's it's so mental bowl and this that same thing by the way it's true Charlottesville Charlottesville wasn't conservatives\nHave these people these creeps that's one of the good things in the ... movie\nAnd yes it has some good things in it some things that are I have more problems with one of the things that I thought was very good in the movie an interview with Richard Spencer who is is leading neo Nazi was very much part of that Charlottesville scene and he's a leftist he's not on the right\nOkay and then there's a another email that came in about where left and right stand right now and where they're going saying that no Republicans haven't moved to the right up plus a a\nTweet that says\nMichael you're wrong President Trump is a hundred percent responsible for where rage takes us in the United states we will get to that and more on disagreement day on the Michael ...\nMichael ...

woman who has an accusation as long as she's not Keith Ellison girlfriend\nUm even with no evidence even with changing stories and indeed so called witnesses who claimed total ignorance and innocence with no cooperation\nThat's enough to make a guilty in this country now and so we have it with the suspicious packages that were delivered to several prominent Democrats over the last few days I use the phrase suspicious packages\nBecause that is what the FBI is calling them they may have been bombs they may have been fake bombs there's a lot to say about all that and a lot to speculate about but if we're going to be as accurate as possible let's use the words from the FBI press release\nYesterday was chock full of stamp eating to conclusions and yet to this moment of broadcast what some

think towards unity towards rock Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down to the political rhetoric and they are making people laugh say they are making sure no less less safe and they're making law enforcement officer is less safe\nBut we don't know who did this or we don't know what their motive was\nRight but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but it's an obvious to read the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros these are\nPeople and organizations that President Trump continually attack style knife CNN was not a target\nUs far okay CNN was an address\nFor John Brennan and an errand one at that John Brennan was a target okay CNN continually wants to insert itself into the story here they merely where they're mistaken address there\nNo more of a target than I Would have been the target is is if if it was addressed to Joe Biden at my home address okay go on\nLook at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed\nAnd starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks leading into mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this say\nI mean there are all people that Donald Trump pay oh they are All right\nAll right All right why am I not to blame by the way why not it might not to blame I've criticized all these people with words worse than fake\nKnow perhaps the most ridiculous of all this is where John King from CNN said quote no one is blaming Donald Trump for the attacks closed quote this just hours after his company president Jeff Zucker did exactly that in a written written statement\nAnd while while while\nThe ... you know the ticker under the main part of the screen\nSaid quote Trump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting a serial bomber close quote well good God\nDid Bill Clinton take any personal responsibility for the Oklahoma bombing and it was a real bombing or Waco\nAnd that was a real assault to Iraq Obama take any personal responsibility for Fort Hood or any other kind\nI could go on and on but you take the point why in the name of all that is good or normal with Donald Trump have the onus to take let's use CNN's words personal responsibility for the suspicious packages\nI'm assuming I'm assuming I can do that can I not I'm assuming that he didn't actually build or male those packages\nThat is what personal responsibility for them would be or to CNN and to the rest of the left wants to stand by the notion that his record rhetoric created this atmosphere of violence well if it did what took so long\nWhen's the last time his rhetoric had anything to do with inspiring the mailing are delivering ... of a suspicious package questioning someone's IQ calling someone crooked and what are the names that have been thrown at Donald Trump\nDid not Jeff Flake compare him to stone has not near entirety of the left comparative to Hitler\nOverstate what I did yesterday when you make someone a Hitler Stalin you have created the exact moral and precise condition for the violent overthrow of that person's government and that person\nBut then again of course I didn't say I didn't see Donald Trump said we cannot act civil live with her opponents as Hillary did a week ago I did not see Donald Trump call for the bombing of Madonna's house as she did his I did not see Donald Trump pulled the decapitated blood soaked ahead of any of the people he didn't or doesn't like\nI didn't see him make a play about their assassination these are all things the left has done with assist from yes CNN and yes the near entirety of the left\nYou know what else I didn't see Donald Trump do sit on the stage with after glad handling Lewis Farah can who was called for violence and who's rhetoric certainly is as via Lee racist as anyone could possibly invent that was a month ago where she wasn't\nBut Bill Clinton lawyers and of course so on that stage was Al Sharpton a Democratic Party candidate for president who has himself started riots but again of course Donald Trump is responsible\nFor rhetoric leading to violence two days ago\nForty eight hours to go to New York times invited several novelists to write for them how the Bob Mueller investigation might just and you might think that's fake news might you asking fiction writers to predict\nHow an investigation might end no matter what matters one of them published in the New York times wrote the story of a Russian assassin shooting Donald Trump with the help of a secret service agent\nAnother character in the story who is working with the Russian assessment says Trump must be silenced because the Russians do not want it getting out that Trump was hand picked by them at the highest level\n[noise] the Russians gun miss fires as the Ames at the president's back in the story says and the story goes on to say that Russia and waited for the secret service than to do the job when something unexpected happened\nThe secret service agents did before him presenting his glock but first here the agent said politely use mind the secret service agent gives his flock to the Russian trying to shoot Trump and that's where the story ends great\nThe New York times this week prince fantasies of assassinating Donald Trump and then lectures are about Donald Trump's inspirations of violence\nAgain I must say it again all Donald Trump Trump did was run for and win the presidency all we conservatives and millions of others did was vote for him\nBut for some reason it's Trump's duty to take personal responsibility\nFor packages that were delivered violent inspired packages that were delivered to Democrats total an utter nonsense but game this out for me if you will when the perpetrator is found if he is a conservative of any kind or show sympathies of conservatism of any kind\nIs there anyone here who won't denounce him or her\nOf course not now quick remind me what was the Bernie Sanders said when he found out that one of his supporters shot Steve ... I don't remember neither do I. U. C. speech free speech\nWhy that has to be a deep state or a false flag operation um seems to me leftists as well as right as soon as well as non ... politicos\nEntirely can use a courier service what is interesting to me\nAbout the courier service is that I've been in the CNN building or any number of times others have already testified to this as well if you ... you know all all of these buildings Fox CNN any major network in any any any any cable or non cable network for that matter [noise]\nThey have a lot of security cameras a lot [noise] so it would be rather I Would think easy um or speedy\nTo um identify the courier and then you know back track or reverse engineer how and who\nDelivered it um but I I again Josh I I I didn't I didn't mean to be ... I just I just don't understand simply don't understand why whether it's male boat helicopter career why it really\nMeans into one eighty olive tree or the other but again if you want to um or someone else wants to to work out on me explain that to me that that would be fine\nAh I Do appreciate that Lance is in Phoenix\nHi Lance Hi how're you doing I'm well how are you\nGood good well I'm not sure if you are aware but I just you know speaking of all this rhetoric eating out um you know I was I went to the Bernie Sanders rally in Phoenix uh last night or the night before\nThe ... you know all the isn't you\nKnow racism you know homophobic all the you know isn't an a\nOr used over two hundred and eighty three hunger time by Bernie Sanders and a David Garcia to smaller than and or some other people running for office here in Arizona and you know if that wasn't an thing things uh I'm In the situation\nI saw the lego representative do they do use the F. word\nHate it I thought I caught that on film yeah [laughter] yeah denouncing the if I'm not mistaken yeah\nYeah he well he is the F word and I was from it was very unprofessional right and um\nAnd uh but just in general uh you know when conservatives disagree with a with a a a leftist or liberal idea they criticize the idea they don't criticize the people I Believe that's more of a hallmark of the left it I'm not even going to talk about your idea\nThe merits I'm never never never because they have a right never ever ever look at what they\nAnd how they treated Kavanaugh it's the personal has to be political and vice versa they politicized the personal and personalized to political it's all about the human being has nothing to do with the idea that's why you know Hillary Clinton yesterday could get away with talking about\nIn passive voice how you know how divided in these times are and how I'm Megan Kelly uh yesterday in her apology more about this later I Want to spend some time on the Kelly's situation why she could say it's been a particularly troubling time for blacks why\nWhy why has it\nBecause a lot of people don't get the person they wanted us to be president to be president ... uh there is no fact on the ground I obscene that shows that are particularly bad time for blacks in fact the industry going the other direction\nExactly and I will tell you that I had a knock in a a make America great hat and he did this rally you did he had a shared\nYour brain man I Want to talk to use some more I'm going to break can you hold a second\nI have more to ask you Kyle and Brad don't go away either six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero yesterday I criticized Megan Kelly for over doing\nHer apology I had not actually heard the broadcast from the day before that she was apologizing for and now may have cost her her job\nI have a lot to say about ... to\nTalk about an overreaction told him she will be right back\n\n\n\nAnd\nNinety sixty news doesn't matter we Oreo con CIA assistant
