straight but they still talk about and there are some people are not this is the true story as well they still haven't I haven't worked at this guy I think that we're talking Fifteen Years ago OK okay there's people that still have these bachelor and\nHome in the kitchen utensils they were pretty good quality it's hot so yeah so yeah I Know it's got to do what you are willing to do a great

yes Halloween is Wednesday so\nI'm you know for the kids are going to go out there trick or treating be safer course I mean we have some fun we're going to talk about reacted to Halloween hearing a little bit but uh you know Josh I ran across this article and it uh it was actually posted in July of two thousand Eighteen and\nIt just kind of funny you know what everything's perception okay I mean unless it's tangible sitting right in front of you and you can yup that's it\nEverything else is just how people perceive ... okay so this guy wrote this article and basically it says what will the U.S real estate market due in two thousand Nineteen wow now I don't know if they actually I think he referenced some other articles as far as where he got this information but what's funny is that ... this\nIt's a great talking point for the show so we're going to talk about this stuff but one of the things I Want people to understand is be careful about what you're reading\nAnd you know I'm you know take it for what it's worth but don't relying just on one information subject either we a Web page or on you know a publication of some sort to look at many\nDifferent things you did you read the disclaimer I'm I might have jumped down to the disclaimer of your article\nThis article attempts to answer the questions what the us real estate market will do in two thousand Nineteen these predictions are the equivalent of an educated guess no one can predict a future real estate trends with complete accuracy this article is intended for educational purposes only\nAnd does not ... to financial advice sub ... maybe we should have gotten that out of the way to I'm Glad you did and I actually have legal because\nAgain this is what will the U.S real estate market due in two thousand I think well this is you know and I'm not trying to make fun of this because there's actually for a you know you know for things that the market might do in two thousand Eighteen which you know is actually you know pretty relevant but number one we could see an increase in New home\nConstruction we are so that's definite that's a hundred percent the key about this as we could see and we we we haven't been seen have been seeing him into\nThat in the Nineteen we will definitely see an increase in a new home construction because we talked about this all the time on the show those single family home permits\nUm that have been taken out by these cities and we get some of our cities over a hundred percent over we were there at last year\nSo you know I get where the guys come from you know he just ... you know this individual just posted this stuff in July of two thousand Eighteen so it's not like this was you know a year ago or a year and a half ago this was only a few months ago\nWe're already seeing yup I'm number two\nMost markets will still favors sellers over buyers\nE. S. E. S. um that we are seeing a slow turn we are it's really ... but it depends where you're at we've talked about this how many times but at the real estate market is like a huge freight train it takes a long time to get up\nTo speed it also takes a long time to slow it down yeah so what we're starting to see the transition from more of a strong seller's market to right now we're seeing a lot of areas and we've talked about this on the all those reports that we we talked about on the show the now we're starting to see slight seller's market\nYou have your under three hundred thousand you're having to ten days on market Oh absolutely absolutely\nBut we're starting to see it you know shift more to a more normal market which is\nYou know somewhat you know it's like there's there's plenty inventory for the buyers is plenty buyers to buy that inventory our days are market go up on\nThe ... months of inventory goes up are starting to see those things already\nThis was something that you know people could predict a actually a while ago um and and but in two thousand Nineteen again because it is a slow process where you're going to start to see that now ... when we start seeing a shift to where it is a buyer's market\nHonestly in Arizona we'd have to get up to around thirty thousand listings we need inventory and also we've got to have almost double the inventory we have now that's not going to take that that can happen\nOvernight gloves that stuff Frank tree and it's going to take a while to get access so two point four months are supplied to to mostly four or five months supply\nYeah exactly exactly so you know that could be not to twenty twenty to where we see those numbers but it started least slowly starting to shift that direction in certain areas have started to shift quicker than others you know but when you're talking and overall market it's going to take some time\nNumber three mortgage rates could approach five percent for thirty are alone\nThey've approaches you they are they're urging five percent for a third of your loan since the beginning of this again this\nThis was around ... this was an article from July so but it's\nStill you know the this is something we could see in two thousand Nineteen were already at that point you know ... what we're doing is this individual is taking the obvious things the obvious things and saying okay you know and and I get why they're doing it because people go ooh hey look at this\nBut this is why it's so important that if you're if you're if you want to get into this market either as a salary as a buyer is to find yourself a great age and like the one we're going to have on the show today or any of our past clients or any you know any great aging out there and sit down and talk with them and say okay I'm thinking about selling\nYou know give me an idea of what we're looking at as far as its markings can concern but you know here's one of the things don't just asked this person\nYou know that ... you know I'm thinking about selling how much can I get from my house is probably the worst thing you can ask\nAnd leave it at that when it comes to being so sure you know or\nI'm a buyer you know what can I get for X amount of dollars a month and you know what you need to do is kind of taken a barometer of what the climate of the market is and that's for me way more important than just how much can I get from my house and how much can they afford as far as you know here's my monthly\nPayment that I'm you know I Would like you know I Want to pay twelve hundred dollars a month what can I get for it yeah you know it's like shopping for a car\nYou know it's funny you talk to them all a and nothing against violent millennials but you talk to them millennial and you say that the interest rate is a five percent\nThey almost have a coronary but you talk to an old timer like you let your industry this is where you got to keep it all in perspective you were doing well and so I Know back when you you had to to write with a chisel and and hammer Alex what rates were probably\nMm eleven present I mean somewhere in that you know how things have been reached by your use carbon paper Hartman papers please press hard when you're right yeah I mean we use carbon paper we talk to us constructions and ... and all that good stuff\nUm twelve percent with the interest rate when I saw a real estate back in eighty three eighty four eighty five somewhere near\nUm and and even if rates let's say 'cause right now you can get in the high force you can get in low five which are still very good rates historically low rates 'em when they start to creep up into the seven and eight percent rate that's when you might want to start to worry a little bit but we we have a ways to go\nBut even if they go to the six and seven percent rate it's not there's gonna be programs you there's going to be the five one arm the three one arm and a lot of people out at you and and it's going to be there in ... it's not going to\nBe that big of a deal enters bite out and there's I mean there's creativity this is the one thing that our market right now\nIs ultra vanilla sure yeah I mean just and I'm happy to see it that way it is it's OK yet you know there's nothing exciting about it it's very stable its ultra vanilla yeah we need to see some more in the story to lots more buyers the buying the market would even be better and I think that's going to happen but honestly this is what we talked about a few months ago is that you know we're in\nThe normalization of the real estate market we have not seen this since prior to two thousand one like I said I'm happy with it or not your normal really good\nSo your number three was mortgage rates can reproach five percent guys were already there in some cases number for home prices will continue rising and most US cities I Hope to God done\nThat and I don't want to be in the city is not\nThere is some rumblings right now and we don't know what's gonna happen I'm\nThat two thousand twenty and we're going to see a recession guy now ... let me explain what a recession is it means to recede\nOkay so if prices drop by a thousand dollars\nWe're in a recession sessions yeah okay so let's say over the last four or five years you made Seventy eighty thousand dollars in equity on your house if all of a sudden the prices stagnated and dropped by a thousand dollars that's considered a recession and who care still made\nA lot less not forget that the real estate market is just like a square I mean it propels itself by the extraction and compression and ... that's what that's what keeps us going so uh it's part of the game\n[noise] Oh absolutely absolutely um it it it ... you want that you want that if everything was Rosie ... every ... the our inflation would be out of control\nYou know home prices would be to the point where you know here's the thing inflation starts to rise when your income don't keep up with the cost of living there and that's what's happening right now is we're ... we're seeing small increments of increases when it comes\nAny notes is there is literally forty or fifty or a ... of people I mean it's crazy it's almost the end that's silly some video game but you do you do walk around this campus and you couldn't walk ... you have more it's crazy\nThe low avatar avatar there's or sorry if I knew what you meant you know so it's it's kinda cool so you know when you're becoming ...\n... world and you've got questions you just go in there and you you'd you'd full a ticket in one of the brokers or one of the uh agent to help desk people will come and you ask the question is really fairly simple so is really unique that you can get things answered real time as my own broker a lot of times\nIf I got questions from a couple of days that I had you know if I didn't know the answer I had to hope that the legal hotline was when I called them and I had to or people that I knew I could start bouncing some ideas here I can get right on line boom and ask the\nQuestions and everything has gone on line I mean ... ... I was a loan officer for Twenty years and there was a time when I Would get up and I would go make sales calls to real estate offices and you catch maybe you know twenty five percent of the agents in the office but you'd still catch agents in the office\nNow days I mean ... real estate offices are have shrunk um and actually just took it a step further and said you know what we're going to be cloud based\nIn that you know probably one of the biggest expenses for many of the companies that are out there I Know for myself you know I had a monthly you know not that I had ... far as the the lease payment and you know it is it looms over you all the time and if you don't have that that alleviate some big headache right there so\nThat money somewhat comes but it it's good for you because it does it will die I'll let you keep going regarding revenue sharing and stuff\nLike and exactly one of the unique things about the excuse that besides being a cloud based company ... and being publicly traded you know\nThey do have the revenue sharing and it gives you a true like I said exit strategy\nAs far as where you want to be when you're done with your career\nI'm you know the residual income that you can make in the it's basically derived from a people that you brought into the into the company you know so\nIf you are actively bringing people in and they're working and doing things that realtors do you'll make a percentage of that a revenue that comes in and you know if you do it correctly\nWhen you're ready to slow down because right now I'm doing sixty deals a year now that's a ton for when I heard yeah I I've got more energy than most but my battery won't run\nOut and we'll run down a little bit [laughter] I mean\nI've got maybe another few years at a pace but then I Want to be able to take a little bit easier and then some day you know it it may not in the near future maybe I don't want to work and the nice thing about the revenue share is as long as you keep an active a license you're still able to share and the revenue\nSo it it does give somebody that you know really when they got done with their career and you know the soldier last house of something else that they're going to keep a receiving\nYup well there's a lot of agents out there that have created you know years and years and years worth of referrals and and you know they've built this business\nAnd you know when things get super busy they you they sometimes have to turn away business ... business somewhere else where you know with your company you can keep going you know and you can keeping even going when you\nDecide to slow down which is great because there's a lot of agents out there that had been doing this a very long time and they'd love to slow down but they would still loved him\nYou know how does it mean kind of threat exactly exactly we're talking to the murder he shoots I'm Sorry you got here with the X ... we're going to take a break we'll be back after this [noise]\n[noise]\nHey guys this is showing Josh Rogosin Arizona real estate matter show which airs every Sunday from two to three here on nine sixty the patriots\nBill this week we're here to spotlight want a west usa real to stop producing real estate agents and Brian Lynch Brian\nThank you Josh and Phil whether you're looking to buy or sell a home rancher land I can help from Scottsdale the ... cave creek carefree buying and selling opportunities are better than ever real estate is the key to building long term well\nI like to highlight one of my latest luxury equestrian states located in the heart and we're already foot hills and among some of Arizona's find this horse properties this beautiful forty five hundred square foot\nCustom home since on five acres overlooking for irrigated pastures manicured yard blue child pool Malone with breathtaking mountain to use this song features five bedrooms ... bathrooms barge studio game room spacious heating kitchen\nAnd much more best of all enjoying some of Arizona's most scenic horseback riding with direct access to three million acres tunnel national forests price to sell at one point one million five other find new and resell home Saudi four hundred and fifty thousand enough\nThank you Brian view any of these properties or any brain just properties go to Brian K Lynch dot com or new brand called six to three nine zero one eight seven seven six to three nine zero morning\nSeven seven and don't forget to listen to Arizona real estate matters every Sunday from two to three five nine sixty the patriots [noise]\nHow'd you like to make an extra twelve hundred Seventy eight hundred dollars monthly safely invested in a real estate tax ...

talking to the shooter he's with the XP ... and see you know in your bio you mentioned that you flip them properties in here talking about your use ... properties Twenty years ago\nAnd and you mentioned it you know when they started you know having\nTV shows about poverty everybody in his brother and his uncle and sister and everybody else when they get into it and there was ... you know companies now they do it um so the competition is a lot stronger now than it ever has been as far as slipping property's concerned but what I'm curious about is you\nKnow flipping probably Twenty years ago compared to flipping properties today what's the biggest what's the big differences but\nI got to tell you there's a huge difference and uh you know still come across the property that I'll flip and you know is more fun flipping property but I can go in and got something and really you know a put my touches on a mutt\nNowadays there's companies out there I'm which I'm sure a lot of people seeing their advertisements they're flipping from the front and he basically what they're going in there and there's telling homeowners hey sell your house us we'll give you almost market price ... they were going to but they charge a fairly large the\nAnd ah you know basically there to kind of doing the same thing now there's other people that are out there flipping and they're trying to buy at auctions or distress sales probate wherever wherever they are getting it from\nAnd uh they're having to buy it and hope that they can you put the money into it and usually not as much money as we used to because the margins are so than they might just let's stick with you know some carpet pain and you know try to get it back on the market they're lucky right now that are marketed as so how did they find something\nYou know and it's under two hundred and fifty thousand dollars three hundred thousand even if it's not the greatest property that they didn't put a whole lot of money into it they're probably still going to make some money it's just a much more a thin margin yeah yeah\nSo in Twenty years ago ten years ago you know Fifteen Years ago whenever you could you could buy a property for in a back of market put ... put some work into it and make a fairly nice try to make a\nDecent hour yeah I mean if if you were I was going to have my own little model if there was\nYou know under two hundred and fifty thousand dollars at the end of the day after I paid for repairs and a commissions and all the fees that go along with buying and selling and all that good stuff in money costs and I was hoping to get you know twenty twenty five grand and sometimes I think a little bit more sometimes a little bit less I mean I see people now doing you know\nFor you listeners out there [laughter] there is a I think for\nFor the for the ... and ... applies to any foreign investors or foreign individuals'\nUm [noise] but don't you know you can have for an individual to live your work or their social 's okay that's one thing but for a lot of people are and I don't know this particular Canadian couple situation\nUm but it sounds to me like this property is subject to for up to now under for that you can buy and sell real estate has a for an individual\nUm you can buy real estate all you want without any kind of tax you know consequences you can actually sell real estate without some tax consequences as long as the property is under three hundred thousand dollars\nThen you're going to be selling it to somebody who's going to live there or at least fifty percent of the time over the next two years in the ... sign of documents dating\nNow once you go over three hundred thousand and all bets are off you know this particular property a twenty six million I think is a tad over the three hundred thousand or threshold matter of fact it's a twenty five million seven hundred\nThousand dollars over a little bit so here's the thing this piece of property could be subject to ... and ... to\nAmount ... ... okay here's the thing if I was quoting this transaction and this property was subject to for a I Would be writing a check to hire us\nFor three point nine million dollars or under for a and this particular property I Believe would qualify under the Fifteen Percent taxable range and his team percentages based off the sales price point ... percent of twenty six million dollars a three point nine million dollars so that's what's going to come right off the top\nThat we're going to give the IRS now that doesn't mean that these people it's gone\nKicking the can they not ... I mean at that point it makes sense to become a citizen future should fades right is that ... I I don't know anything about that but for the sole purpose of your home about keeping three hundred three point nine million I Would deal with this is what to do a lot from three point nine million sure\nAnd this is what prevents foreign individuals from coming here buying up real estate selling it and running with the ... okay so um I don't know again what their personal tax situation is if they have social Z or not but you know I haven't seen a whole lot of Canadian buyers who don't have to worry about ... I've had I had seen it but it's rare\nWell if you're selling your ... to point twenty six million dollar was probably a second home there from Canada if three point nine million may not be that big of a deal that might just be so well no no\nHe said it's probably a bit of hunting for us maybe not for them yeah exactly so that those kind of interesting the next highest price home\nOn the market um when this article ... which was just a week ago and a was a house on a sixty eight string paradise valley it was listed for Eighteen million\nSo eight million dollars last was an exercise but I um if you go on the Phoenix business journals website and you find this article there's pictures of this song okay\nIt looks like a very very very nice office ... yeah I mean none office building almost like a resort kind of like a ... not saying that it's that it's sterile like an office building or like that but I mean it's just\nThat ... you know less the golf carts in in in staff and it could have a twenty million dollars is\nA beautiful beautiful home and and for the sake of the agents that are selling us I'm a mother and a son a team I'm ... I'm good for them because that's seven hundred and eighty thousand and three percent seven or Ninety thousand dollar paycheck\nAin't too darn some bad how'd you do\nThat you don't want so I wanted to talk about something um you know a lot of our agency when we do ah my my lifting age as my ... they'll they'll obviously do their you know just listed ... they'll do put it on the AMA less you know they'll\nThey'll do things to market and promoted but one of the things that a lot of them are ... and this is a really true for a luxury listings especially\nBut one of the things a lot of people don't even think about doing is trying to market to some of the out estate buyers you know we talked\nLast week about how Maricopa County is the number one county for people moving into a from a all over the country\nAre and so what we did is we actually spoke to to Michael or who is the gentleman that runs the crime for reports\nAnd uh we had him put together a all the data for two thousand Seventeen were the were closed MLS transactions were out estate buyers and we excluded large state investors like open door an invitation homes and so far so we so we don't have any investors at that [noise]\nSo basically what we did is we pulled up and we came up with the uh eight major and best feeder markets these are these eight areas where out of state buyers are coming in and buying Arizona properties\nAnd what we do and what I Do it for my agents if they have a a luxury lifting the they it's been on the market all while\nHis we'll actually do an e blessed I have the ability to email or any real estate board in the country so I can hit the greater San Diego association of realtors the Minneapolis association older but was sexually put a fire together and we will eat blast that fire out to the speed or market boards\nAnd those feeder markets I just started we kind of interesting\nUh to go through the top eight feet or markets for and this is uh\nBasically in order or Los Angeles is one of the top ones and it's actually saying she'd be San Diego is one of our top feeder markets a we have Seattle King County in Washington a we have Denver a we have Chicago uh Minneapolis ah Portland Fort Worth Texas and a Milwaukee\nSo when we go and we blast this we would be hitting about forty two almost forty three thousand agents with this last ... last we just did this for another luxury agent of mine she got several phone calls on it so I Know it works but if you are a you have a a luxury property is but on the market\nAll but um and do you want to try and maybe have some other markets look at it give me a call I'd love to help you mark and it's not just the luxury market you know I Am not limited to that\nI honestly believe that you know we talked about this I I'm not sure was last week of the week before that how in Maricopa County was number one in the United states as far as migratory route\nIntermediate thousand I think is what we when the number was sure\nFor I Believe it or how many migrating on her server again in America yeah just for America and kind of in in Southern California was number one I Believe it or what was right within the top two or three I Know that\nMy yeah well in Los Angeles was the number one ...\nThat's what I meant yeah you're you're there in ... California coming here yet Denver the one of the city that you mentioned your cattle was another one of course the Midwest I was surprised to see shoot Chicago so far down the line\nBut here's the thing you know when people now granted people do have the ability to go online and look at properties all day long so if you're sitting there and you know at your home and wherever city you're in and say okay I'm moving to Phoenix now want to take a look ... what I can find\nThat's great but this would allow an agent to be able to market their particular property ... choose that the masses in that area\nAbsolutely and and the blast is going to real estate agents in that area but there's not a realtor out there that doesn't work went to work out some type of a you know I'm In a referral fee I mean that's exactly what would happen on this but you know what it's it's just an outside the box wait to get your property in front of more people in and more potential buyers\nAnd ah so anyway uh the feeder markets or I just wanted to bring those I\nKnow I think it's a great idea or these great again I think if if I was an agent today I Would definitely utilize that even for maybe you know not just the lecturing marketing man if I had a handful listening to maybe I have one that's really just not moving for whatever reason there and give it a shot out\nYup shot yeah well if it you know if I had a three hundred thousand dollar listening it probably wouldn't waste the money on it because before I could even get my my ... fire dissolve a journal sure but what about four fifty a ... possibly be five hundred five hundred yet which are nice and they told me that that's not what they considered luxury yeah and what's great\nAbout it as if you do we give the ... when we after we blasted out we give the uh the agent and the homeowner the stats of how many agents ... the forty two thousand how many agents actually open the email how many agents actually followed the hyper link to the analysts listening so we can give them stats let's just a great tool to top marketed property\nI absolutely that's one of the great things about him far west as we have a lot of tools you know there's a lot of companies out there with a lot of tools got one of the things I found about this company is that the tools that we have have the highest rate of return yeah you know anybody can send out a postcard anybody can send out a flyer but how can we get to the target audience\nEmpire West is the Swiss army knife a real is of a title companies we have every tool you need okay so we would give us a call ... hey let's talk a lot to talk about some some fun haunted stuff yeah\nWhen I Want I Want to do this because I think that's an interesting with the Halloween being on Wednesday I'm I ran across some graphs and this I mean this is this isn't just somebody playing around having fun they actually pulled some people\nAbout you know ha ha ha ha house you know I don't think gives you the creep whatever you don't have to believe and goes you know but there are things that happen which\nWhether you believe it or not you can't really explain ... so one of the things that the answer was for a buyer you know would you consider moving into a on a house and if they said no and they said well wait a minute you know what if there was a trade off here that made it worth your while to all of these buyers that they they asked\nUm there was a total of a loving hundred people that I asked about\nThey said they would move into a hundred and home nine percent said sure I think for a larger kitchen and a better neighborhood did take to go ... exactly a Fifteen Percent\nThe dentist Springer show from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania today flew very early this morning from Pennsylvania has a terrific prevent last night\nWith my colleagues Hugh Hewitt\nAnd Michael ... bed\nAnd wonderful folks from the local station in Pittsburgh who am I got to meet many for the first time in a big audience and [noise]\nI really enjoy Pittsburgh I had a very very very warm feeling about that city and I hadn't been there in a while it's sort of my uh my new\nTampa I'm that's not replacing Tampa but it's up there but there is ... yeah that is a ... hour you're right 'cause how often do I say that the truth exactly right\nOne of the painful things and then I Want to give it to the president's speech last night I got a lot to talk to you about but one of the painful things to me about\nThe these attacks on America and specifically white Americans is how many wonderful white Americans there really are\n[laughter] to ... to defame\nI mean they're wonderful people of every group obviously but you're only allowed to defame white Americans is if there's something particularly noxious about white America\nWhen America is a lot of beautiful people in it\nIt's really disgusting it's just disgusting that hate us so overwhelmingly from one direction it's just painful\nPeople living in denial of that\nBy the way I commend to you my column my Tuesday column I have my message to the kid of color comes out on Tuesdays I commend it to you National Review town hall Dennis Prager about ... great miss many uh many places Kerry and many local newspapers most recently the Cleveland Plain dealer\nToday's his top political it is it is about the question based on my experience of car dealers last week\nUm the issue of male ambition specifically and other matters of young people talk about later I Want you to hear some clips the president spoke in Houston\nOr yesterday to an enormous crowd or they they about Eighteen thousand fill the arena\nAnd you know who who gets those numbers on the left and I I I'm not\nMaking an argument time I'm asking the question who does get those those Brock Obama get those numbers I Am very curious about who gets those numbers\nOn the left anyway\nI uh I Want you to hear about some of the things first there's this one is very powerful or about who we worship want to want to play that one show him [noise]\nOr\nOf American Life so true\nAnd above all we know that in\nWe don't worship [noise]\nGovernment we worship God [noise]\nNow I ... it so I when I listen to these things this is just a habit of a lifetime when ever I listened to such things like whenever I speak I hear the voice of leftists in my brain\nIt's\nAn automatic response to me it's almost ... how exactly is someone on the left responding and of course the lows everything was just said loaded\nSo that is to give away as to this very important distinction between left and non left do\nYou do with what was just said if you don't you're not a leftist and what is it exactly that is a load some about it so let's go part by part much begin again if you would show on with the kneeling and the ...\n... and the flag and [noise]\nFor\nSo hold on there what why is that load assumed that we proudly stand for a national anthem and for our national ... why would that be low\nTo some to a leftist\nIt's worth it's worth analyzing I'd like to to play this for a friend and say listen I just want to understand how you think I'm not going to argue\nI Wanna I I assume that you find is objectionable\nSo\nLet let let me in on it what is bad about that we ... proudly stand for our national anthem and our national flag\nAnd by the way I frankly\nDon't know the answer I almost always know what a leftist will say but I this one's a tough one what what are they going to say to proudly stand for the national anthem in the national flag is an act of white supremacy I it's a code word for bigotry\nIt's a dog whistle to seem a phobia want to I don't know exactly what they would find I nobody find it frightening and disgusting and the thought of Eighteen thousand people cheering for a further reinforces\nTheir disgust but I I really want you to understand\nThat it's a fairly recent vintage in American Life\nThat people would find a president saying we proudly stand for our national anthem and our flag to be disgusting let alone fascist okay this is this is because we have gone so far west\nBeyond where the left was even one generation we go next please\n[noise]\nNot government bureaucracy\nOf American Life so\nAll right so hold on their show show yeah so okay so what would they left to say what's wrong with their faith and family used the true center of the American democracy or not was a government them bureaucracy\nSo you may recall democratic convention a number of years ago we played it on the show a number of times I was I was actually at that convention I heard it live\nWhere they ... the ... D a narrator the dmc whatever term is used for the voice of a convention that you know the resident and voice\nGovernment is what Americans all Americans have in common or he's the one thing all Americans share something to that effect they really do believe that it has supplanted faith and family government and a bureaucracy\nHe's right about that see it's\nFour percent of the west as soon as the president says something to a crowd in particular it is considered Neil ... and all the usual adjectives thrown out but I I really want to know from people what is wrong with that is faith and family not to the center\nThe lynchpin of American Life should not be by you admit that it's that it's gradually no longer the case of faith and family forty percent of Americans born to unwed mothers now and faces dwindling\nBut is that a good thing such a question to ask a a person of the west in your life mixed number three claim number three of the president [noise]\nAnd above all we know that is in\nWe don't worship [noise]\nGovernment we worship God [noise]\nIt was as if he took a line ... plying them out of my mind that\nThat he is I'm just saying it was it was as if he would be from my current\nVideo up at ... are you a preview university on the American trinity that's exactly right because as government gets bigger God get smaller in the western world but see exactly what was happening government has some place the state has\nAnd I so I'm just wondering is that what he that's obviously no I shouldn't even ask that is obviously what\nHe is dating it's a term of the all right so it's you you so again folks this is to educate you this this is not this is not even to advocate a position as much as to educate\nFor the left nationalism has always always always been a
