market crashes and sometimes it crashes hard\nFor most of your life you didn't really care in fact if you're like me I wanted to market to crash back in my younger years why because it was a buying opportunity besides I knew the market will recover and I was young enough that I wasn't going to be using the money anytime soon anyway\nThings are different now closer I get to retirement the last cavalier I get towards my retirement money the more I realized that I have very little or no time to recover from a major market correction\nMark Twain once said I'm not so interested in return on my

financial shows or the other brokers out there I Know it is because we keep you from doing something and saying with the retirement\nRemember the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the truth is that nothing's changed your portfolio is at risk when you were twenty five years old just as much as it is at risk today\nSo what's the difference the difference is your age your time period for recovery\nWhat makes putting your retirement money in the stock market bonds variable annuities are any variable investment crazy is that

buying a home is one of the largest purchases they'll ever make what risks you have when you buy a home\nFor one you ever ask a market value lost many people learned that in two thousand eight right\nMany people thought that there was no significant risk from your home going down in value but that perception has now changed forever what about risk of property loss flood fire earthquake when storm or theft those are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment\nOther properties you might only have the same risks have you on a car a boat airplane or any other property was significant value there is a risk of last what do you own something of significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you know the obvious answer here you get insurance on those assets right insurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something they'll probably never use so why would you buy insurance on your home\nYou might say well I have a loan on my house so I have to buy insurance on it so that may be true but what if you're homeless paid for what'd you still buy insurance on your home I bet you would but why\nWhether you realize it or not\nYou'd buy insurance on your home because of something called the catastrophic risk\nCatastrophic risk means that you have any chance even if it's a small chance to lose a lot of value\nIn other words you could lose a lot of money if something bad happens the reason we buy insurance on our home is because the cost of insurance is very small compared to the last we might incur if a catastrophic event happens\nJust for the fun of it let's assume you live in a modern home it's up to current building codes you don't smoke and fall asleep and your bed you don't light candles and leave them on attended and you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen\nIf I'm describing you there's a very small chance your house would catch on fire\nEven show I bet you have homeowner's insurance and the reason why is because losing your home would be a catastrophic financial loss so the relatively small cost of the insurance is we're paying for right\nThat's why you protected with insurance you know I'm right so let me ask you another question wouldn't it make sense to have insurance on your retirement money why don't you have insurance on your retirement money

strongly encourage everyone to think about their money in terms of bread money hungry money those terms may sound funny but I Believe they can help us understand a very important concept but let me

gains\nRed money is always exposed to the upside and downside of market risk\nGreen money on the other hand is about safety and security was green money were not willing to accept the risk of losses so this money typically we're willing to accept a lower return in exchange for safety and security\nGreen money does not have downsides market risk so Fred money's exposed the upside and downside market risk\nAngry money has only upside market potential which ones better well that's probably the wrong question to be asking because neither one is inherently good or bad\nIt all depends on your situation\nThe very important question we should ask ourselves or these what percentage of my money should be in red money and what percentage of my money should be angry and money if you're at or

her on duty\nOr\nThe victim comes in or with whatever it might be or or or someone in an accident or they have to go to work them\nJust so happened that Dr Savino is in surgery at the present moment and has been in surgery for quite a few hours so we will not be able to bring him to you today\nBut we will uh then continue on with the balance of our program that was a a went out in our update to

know once upon a time [noise]\nPeople in leadership roles whether that was government whether it's parents and the home teachers at school management team at where you work\nThey would ask you to do things based on\nThings that they had already done were experienced in and know that they worked\nThey actually would say to you don't just do as I say do is I have done and are doing now\nBut that was once upon a time\nToday it seems that far too many living in a world of their own\nThey think you should do as they tell you to do not as they themselves may have ever done before or have any knowledge of how to go about doing it now\nAnd if the current atmosphere as any gauge as to where we're heading with all of this trust me it's not pretty\n... ... is ever present is even considered as no big deal by many people somebody hear somebody say something that is so opposite\nOf how that individual acts or has acted as a scholar oh\nWell instead of being appalled and\nTaken to task the individual speaking history provides us\nWith warnings regarding values and accountability without either or both of those [noise] it's difficult to retain any semblance of civility and principals\n\nIt's time to end the hypocrisy and we need to get back to leading by example and not through idle words\nLet me give you an example government\nWe just went through a really big shocking\nDisplay of government individuals elected to positions of leadership at their worst with the\nNomination process of now justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nWe know that person's nominated by the president for a cabinet position or did it feel some other federal post has to undergo an FBI investigation I mean just the way it is\nThe findings are then turned over to the appropriate confirmation committee\nAnd then those individuals\nThat are being nominated are subjected to public hearings oftentimes they get nationwide exposure on the bigger appointments such as was the case for the Supreme Court\nTheir lives even from childhood are laid bare and all of this is done under the guise then presented by our legislature that the public has a right to know absolutely everything about the nominee\nWhy then do the people that have the power\nTo seat or deny a seat to any of these individuals why do they not have to subject their own backgrounds to an FBI investigation and then be vetted by their peers\nAs being qualified or not just sit in judgment of others\n\nIf we are all created equal if we believe in the rule of law and that we are equal under the law then how can those who have given themselves through a law that they themselves wrote and\nPast how can they give themselves safe harbor from public eyes regarding their past and their president behavior\nWhen it comes to areas of whether it be sexual abuse lying drunkenness tapped aggressiveness and violence and even possibly additional improper notice\nHow can they\nHillary Clinton we can't be civilized\n\nWhat the Republicans\n\nCory Booker get in their face by the way speaking of Cory Booker hey congratulations Iowa\nHe's running around your state last\nI heard some of my friends from New Jersey said that they're throwing surprise parties all over all over the state of New Jersey and they're doing it right now because they know Korea's out of state and therefore they don't have to invite him to their parties\nAnyway I don't\nKnow how you drew the short stick Iowa but you've got it\n\nAnd then there's of course Maxine Waters who said and I quote God is on our side\n\nIf you see a member of the Trump cabinet push back ... out in their faces tell them you don't belong here really Maxine Waters a representative of the state of of what the district in California\nAre you folks serious you voted and and and she's up for reelection and you're thinking about voting for her\nA woman who says God is on our side\n\nThe sixty three million this Seventy million how many ever will be this year that votes on a republic and for Republicans versus a Democrat in your area\nAcross the nation\nAll of those individuals that would vote for Republican God is against them\n\nI don't know a Bible Maxine Waters is ban reading but I guarantee you it's not saying what I have\n\nImagine if you would this type of\n\nVeteran all coming from a Republican running for office today wow the mainstream media would be all over it with their self righteous indignation\nGet interface\nWe can't be civil with Republicans kick them when they're down got is on our side tell them you don't belong here or LA\nHey
