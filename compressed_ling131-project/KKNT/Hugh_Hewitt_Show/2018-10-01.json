the way of one of the most consequential weeks ahead in\nModern American politics will the new McCarthyism work will slander as in the seat analyzed directed at judge Brett Kavanaugh succeed but well enough decent men and women in the United States Senate step up and say no us\nThis is not acceptable I understand the motivation of Jeff Flake he just did not seem to understand that the left would not in good faith undertake additional inquiry into the credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh as they were termed by Democrats\nI don't think there are any credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh but Democrats do they believe that\nJudge ... board as a credible allegation in my world of the law is not credible\nTo be an uncorroborated accusation from thirty plus years ago that has many internal inconsistency that had been teased out over the weekend that anyone who was just on it would agree\nSimply falls apart under close scrutiny and the allegation misery mirrors and don't even rise the level of allegation they are a simple\nSmear so the FBI will be busy with the remarriage allegations there's nothing more to be done with Dr\nToward she testified under oath at great length and her testimony is known to the Senate there are no other witnesses as she has admitted they can talk to Mr judge\nWho took up all the other boys from Georgetown Prep should be done today\nI fully expect shut up majority leader McConnell to apply it filed for cloture tonight which sets in motion thirty hours of debate so that on Wednesday they would vote on the motion to\nClose debate and if it passes with fifty one boats to fifty three votes or we may mansion and hike camp are left\nBut under the mansion standard that you need more than accusation I expect him to vote to proceed that will go to the Senate for final but on Thursday that's what I'm hoping for all weekend long I watched them used that Democrats attempt to change\nThe focus from the FBI's investigation as to whether they're or anything\nElse to the credible allegations that Democrats are credible but which I I reject\nAnd that means the Yale allegation and the doctor blogs he poured allegation there's nothing else by the way they ever for the prosecution one of the hits on Kavanaugh that he raped someone on a boat in Rhode Island that person's going to jail because they called Sheldon Whitehouse and that idiot\nYou people Rhode Island you have an idiot representing him in the sense that idiot leak that to the press and they put that out there again Brett Kavanaugh has two daughters ten and fourteen\nAnd they switched over\nTo a week on a salt on the fact that he was angry at being accused of being a rapist Saturday Night live when all that\nDespicable just despicable\nBrett Kavanaugh had been rated\nHighly qualified fully qualified I as ... has and the left has been working all we get along to get that back because the left intervene and the person that the president's ... friday\nWithout talking to the idea committee on judicial standard they've got the highest qualification for ratings he taught forever and Harvard He is known by everybody in the legal community I don't know much of that from the beginning it wasn't my first choice but I Will not let any stone go on thrown\nAgainst the McCarthy I Know when McCarthyism does by the way it was directed over the weekend I'm not going to tell you the details at a young left wing journalist or young left wing journalist on Twitter came under assault with just a few keystrokes find out what you did at ... school\nTo this person and exploded that's McCarthyism\nYou move from the Rosenbergs who were treasonous Alger Hiss perjured himself because he was a a traitor genuine honest to God communist agents to accusing him blacklisting people in the Hollywood on the basis of mere accusation that tail gunner Joe stop you know it was set up a tail gunner Joe Margaret\nChase Smith first woman senator senator from Maine stood up to Joe McCarthy\nThan I Am hoping that every Republican follows the Margaret Chase Smith example and will have nothing to do with\nThis I was disappointed when Jeff Flake past or the FBI investigation I wanted to move forward but I Know he's a decent fair guy and he thought this would help that didn't\nJeff is continually disappointed by the people around him and disappointing Chris Coons in an Angus King for not denouncing the smears I don't expect them to vote for judge Kavanaugh they they would prefer to have a liberal they would prefer to have another Elena Kagan said to my are but they lost the election\nI expect every Republican to vote for him and I expect Joe mansion Heidi Heitkamp to represent their states or they will be defeated\nI think they're going to lose anyway but they will most certainly be defeated you need to call your senator two two two to four three one two one two oh two two to four three one two one and tell them whatever way they are building on Kavanaugh they need to denounce\nMalignant evil slander against him Tom Cotton was on face the nation yesterday cutting number twenty three\nJudge Kavanaugh hundred

Kavanaugh was nominated the very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader\nSaid that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months the Democrats have turned the advice and consent process into a search and destroy you mention these allegations are completely an supported by any evidence what evidence there is twenty thirty six year old climb\nAll support judge Kavanaugh's denial than the Democrats have this crisis process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign character assassination they've run against US Cabinet\nTheir argument of course was that doctor for an asset that is held in confidentiality and if they tried to do that\nAnd that's what it was worth living alone I don't know no no no no John let me talk to you about that when they talk to your listeners about your views about that there was a well established process of confidentiality on the committee\nDianne Feinstein could've show that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI and could have discreetly conducted this\nInquiry in July and August

few days\nThat's where we are unfortunately as a country what matters is getting judge Kavanaugh confirmed at this point unless something emerges that is conclusive that somehow corroborate each the claims that he did any of this stuff\nWhat we know so far is that the witnesses to Dr Christian lousy Ford's allegation have not corroborated what she said in fact they said they don't know what she's talking about they don't have any rent a memory of it they there's no affirmation\nI Am very sensitive and mindful of the fact that there are undoubtedly sexual assault victims who don't have
