afternoons at three oh nine sixty the patriots\nAnd there are high Canada\nLiterally comes to the assignments outweigh today and joins me from abroad David\nKirkpatrick of the New York times he is the author of into the hands of the soldiers freedom and chaos in Egypt and the middle east you were recall about two months ago they joined me for a long interview about into the hands of the soldiers which I consider to be a must read primer\nOn Middle East and he joined me today to talk about the disappearance of Jamal ... who is his friend David welcome what was your relationship with democracy do you\nPlay with the source you know he was somebody I was friendly with the fact that we would have lunch together and chitchat you know and not someone I Would have over to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew and we all knew him he was he was a hard guy not to like\nThat that is what I've been told by the many people I've talked to about this about a half an hour ago Muhammad ... posted this Saturday website says Riyadh authorities will some of the Fifteen people parental turkey claims whether hit team that killed ... show me\nClose friends to ask them what they were doing it if the ball and the day 'cause she'll be died what do you see happening David\nWell the music the mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services that turkey was likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledge that Jamal show he had been killed inside\nThe confidence in his temple\nAnd that seems like the way things are headed at this hour last night of a well informed\nSource or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia\nHad identified the person they're going to say is responsible he put it more honestly and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person and intelligence had the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong\nUm if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that has seemed terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia or for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nAnd this is the Henry the second defense from when the English King said ... will no one read me a bit troublesome praised him for his lights go off and slaughter Thomas Rebecca and Ken America the drill it works and you know the twelve hundred in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent\nPublic judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think\nWell what his works main you know for ... governments make do with a partial truths fairly often\nOr the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish of officials and all this been confirmed it's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair his ... his reputation\nYou know he he'd gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up the kingdom kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIf in fact to the person that has been identified to you by a good source as likely to be\nPointed to as the prime mover the rendition gone bad\nUm implicates NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do you think the royal court changes in succession\nA ... two elements there first of all I think this person is a intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person is try that person will be tried in that Saudi court\nSo that's not the kind of court we're used to where the defendant might have an opportunity to blame the crown prince\nA second of all\nA you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession\nA Saturday and it has changed crown prince ... consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key\nLevers and so the best handicapping if there is no one in addition to change if we ran into challenging for a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over this he's made many enemies along the way none of them seems to have\nEnough heft to push him out of a lot of succession as long as they're dead is okay with it is dead is elderly and may not be that company right now\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king I'm not too long ago and she expected me with NBS when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that\nThere is within the guy and this was just a range of possibilities giving that having a second option which is your ... responsibility but not a guilt\nThe other one as you say someone was trying to take me out the rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the royals that I had to improve the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know and to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that is what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend of ... of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nWho felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nThat is entering the second is pure Henry the second term is back at a parallel will that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the facts in the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would the Henry the second offends me six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared it's intelligent red turkey Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe a video of from inside the conflict showing who did what ... you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that wish there U.S intelligence ... who often work very closely with the Turks and then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it\nThat's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S to try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared\nReally right now it doesn't impact for example the war in Yemen this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and America\nTrying to confront the hook these you are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome to tie as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nOr I'm not sure that has any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish tennis whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday you know getting ahead of the Saudis and already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis have begun to float that explanation\nThemselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as the succession inside Saudi Arabia is an change\nCan therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts certain moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this\nAbove the fold for very long ... Patrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion\nYou know the wall street and Silicon Valley or he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they're no out to help diversify the Saudi economy he's going to find it very hard to be\nA front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues\nIn terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nSo last question David Patrick Winn into the hands of the soldiers goes into a paperback edition or is this going to be the the forward because this is I don't know if it's a turning point for a bump in the road\nYou know to sort of do\nWell I appreciate your coming to join me David ... Patrick on the New York times author of into the hands of the soldiers which is the definitive you've got to read it to understand what the Arab Spring was about what happened to the Arab Spring where the new on time comes from and how it is going\nThat that's going on Amazon dollars disclose that but I Would check it because it's a marker for everything we know it's a mark up for freedom alliance defending freedom\nAlliance defending freedom yesterday or the smart guys on\n...
