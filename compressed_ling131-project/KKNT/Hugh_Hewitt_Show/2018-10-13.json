ones that I have right now for fourteen hundred and Ninety eight dollars less now part of that had to do with a bumping the trading you'd already started with too much money for their trade\nExplain what that means bumping the trade is something that\nWe have cash in his five thousand dollars it's it could be a hundred and fifty dollar bills that could be fifty hundred dollar bills when you have cash there is no changing but if you have a trading the dealership looks era trading near first number on the cars five grand\nYou are not buying a car and they have no place to go fewer five grand and cash the general manager is not reaching into his pocket and giving you a thousand dollars although a lot of\nPeople seem to think that they're going to talk dealerships into doing that which is kind of funny to me yeah\nYou're kind of funny and you know what I always tell people is you don't talk dealership and to doing anything now when they bump to trade it means they look at the car and they say you know if we can make a deal and I got to put another thousand the trade if the customer buys the car let's go now Dana said something just now\nMaking the car dealership do something\nIt was October first in my phone was blown up it was a salesman and it was a general sales manager at a car dealership and the general sales manager explained to me it was the end of their quarter she needed to sell a certain amount of cars when can you be here I Know you were looking at a car\nSo when I got there and we put all the numbers and I looked at the screen I put the numbers in the computer\nAnd when I put the numbers in the computer by the way you tried that at home it didn't it didn't work at the math didn't work for me\nIt's all of a sudden the GSM walks into the office and

my deal I grind you when it's my clients when it's my ideal I don't want to be that guy\nAnd our job Dana nice to protect you to get you the best deal so all of a sudden the general sales manager the dealership looks in the screen and says how far apart a week\nAnd I said twenty five hundred bucks and it's no harm no foul and he looked at me and said listen\nI called you you didn't come here looking for a car I Need this car deal and he looked at robbing and she had gone to the screen bumped the trade to grand and knocked another five hundred off the price of the car there's you're twenty five hundred bucks and he stuck his hand out\nNow just like when you watch American Pickers I reached out and shook his hand and said okay I'll do that unlike lucky you do on that on your own as Dana

transaction once every several years in some cases even longer between\nAnd unfortunately as I mentioned earlier mentioned countless times it's not how you get there that matters it doesn't matter how they advertise\nI I had a nice couple who is who said recently who is also a radio show listener and they wanted to to wait\nAnd get an Eighteen Subaru Outback [noise] um you know and make sure that they've got the best deal possible and after talking to him for a few months I said well the dealer that I'd be contacting hasn't had a new Eighteen out back for some time now\nSo many people think that they know what's going on they think that oh we wait till the end of the year and we're going to get the leftover ... a great deal and that's just not been reality for so long\nI don't normally\nI Can't remember the last time I paid off color but this will be the last car like this that I buy because I I drive Emanuel transmission and those are going away and they're going away so I'm fifty eight years old I probably bought my last couture vehicle [noise]\nBy the time I'm ready for my next car if I'm In a wheelchair um amusing a Walker I'm going to want some kind of Ford or Sudan\nBut folks when I bought the car I I didn't need gap because I have plenty of equity in the car that I was trading in [noise]\nI didn't need gap because I bought the car would thirty two hundred and fifty dollars worth of rebates I cracked up laughing the guy looked at me and said do you have a leash car that's register your address\nAnd I looked at him and said you know I don't and then all of a sudden it hit me that my daughter has a Honda Accord that fleece and it's done it in my address all I had to do is call my daughter send me a picture of your registration and I got a thousand bucks now\nWhen I bought the car I drive on average about twenty thousand miles so I bought a five year hundred thousand mile warranty [noise] so when I go to get out of this car it will either be\nSometime between the fourth and the sixty year but it will not be\nPassed the fifth end of the fifth year I won't drive the car without a warrant team now when I help people buy cars and sometimes they they they don't see the value now\nWhen someone says to me I don't need a warranty because I have a friend that can fix my car you know they don't I got plenty of friends that can fix my cards the stupidest statement in the ... a friend that can steal the porch [laughter]\nNow I don't know what the numbers but Dana will answer the question and it's not a trick question 'cause I Know he knows the answer when you have a car repaired in a dealership what would you say the percentage of the repair parts well how do you see what was it when you did it\nWell it depends obviously on the type of repair that's being done but more often than not parts or more are much further apart than the labor which I think what he's asking me but as far as a percentage maybe thirty percent of Seventy\nSo I had a young man that were in the car dealership and they offered him a hundred thousand mile launch on a car or whatever it was on the ... weren't you is not that expensive\nAnd I said to him\nIf you can eat enough to understand something you have stretched on below hope\nYou stretch the rubber band as far as you possibly can to get to the monthly payment that you can barely live with\nNow she needed because of his family a third row seat\nHe needed a new vehicle because he needed the rebates\nAnd the only car that worked for him was a dodge journey well if you buy a dodge journey and you don't buy a warrant to you by any American products car and don't buy warranty you would not be following our guidance okay so I looked at the young men and I said\nIf you can give me one good reason why you don't need the warranty I'll pay for it and he starts chuckling he starts laughing and he says well my buddy can fix the car and his wife starts laughing well you know what\nI'm gonna then that's a good reason I said okay but there's a park the\nWhere's the parts come from or a member of this a warranty don't use the word warranty don't use the word service contract used the term that it really is insurance insurance\nShow when you buy a insurance policy on your car you're not buying it because you want to have a car accident\nYou're buying it so that you're covered in the event there is an issue it's the same thing with the service contract now every single car I've ever owned that had a service contract with the exception of one\nI use the warranty for more than I pay for it now at two thousand and six Mustang GT that was purchased by my wife when she was my girlfriend and we bought a five year Seventy five thousand mile warranty\nAnd I had a couple of repairs on the vehicle the only problem was we made it past a hundred thousand miles without the repairs [noise] but it's it's not a service contract it's not a warranty it's insurance\nAnd and the key in my opinion is it it's going to quickly an individual decision and then when people especially in this market place and I'm sure across the country\nOften when they go to purchase a an extended service contract or an extended warranty the proper terminology being service contract\nIs often offered by in after market company and it's often offered at a at a premium that is not justifiable not that there are times where I'm sure people pay fair prices in relationship to those products are [laughter] but\nThey'll strongly that if you are going to consider buying that insurance that it should be the factory extension of the coverage not an after market company that\nIs arguably in the interest of the dealer to sell but not in the interests of the consumer to sell I Am not aware of any after market warranty that is rated higher than the factory warranty from the same brand so if that happens to be the case pleasing like me please call and let me know [laughter]\nI can be reached at six o two six seven nine eight three to four\nAnd six so two six seven nine eight three to four so unless I'm wrong if you are going to consider the insurance for the key would be the best coverage which would be from the factory than having it tailored\nTo your actual driving needs you know if you drive you know a lot of miles pier I can Gary's case\nYou know he ... to the twenty thousand miles a year he anticipates driving and bought a five year policy there are so many times when people go into a dealership and up in the bill sheeting in the business office without the proper skill sets\nAnd and the purchasing an extended service contract that doesn't even covered them for the term of the loan that they're financing the car for and it it happens in the people that are selling the product not having the best intentions\nAnd worrying more about how much money they can make as opposed to the actual clients needs\nBecause in the logic would dictate they sell the factory warranty and even if they're going to make a profit on it at least they'd be offering the client or does in their best interest and the and make a profit on it\nWhen I helped guide someone or when Gary help someone guide someone and it comes to making a decision on that insurance policy it's an individual decision and it's quite clear that Gary leans towards purchasing that coverage because he does not liking chemical repairs or surprises ever\nAnd in his own personal experiences he shared virtually in every case they paid for themselves [noise]\nIt's not our decision to make for you but when we help people acquire those insurance policies we get them at the Ferris lowest possible price for the best product in vale herbal so in the event that you elect to purchase insurance policy\nYou're getting the best you can be elected not to get it you at least know what you could have had\nYou know and and here's another thing when you're buying a car I always tell people you leave with a couple of humble option you lead the finance office and one of the things a lot of cardio option dealerships have gone to these\nWhat do they come to a ... a Usb drive yeah our debt and they print all your they put all your stuff on a U.S on our drive [noise]\nI'm not a fan of that I liked papers so what I always do is is when you buy a car you get a certain amount of paperwork that needs to go into your house\nThat would be a dominant disclosures contracts buyers orders GAP insurance policy warranty policy but if you buy an extended service contract you can't hurt yourself\nBy making an extra copy of the Senate service contract and keep that in the car\nWell in some kind of separate the you know one of the things that come up in the news and it's been something that's been going on for for decades in this valley I assure you across the country where people when they go to Todd their paperwork to buy a car\nSometimes the dealership when they're filling out the credit application for you they are kind of nuts to give you a pay raise that you don't happen to see in your paycheck but at the bank sees it and therefore says hey this person makes that much money and they have this good credit so we're going to approve that\nYou have to make sure that when you're buying a car that you are the person responsible for the information being provided and that you actually understand how to calculate your income mostly dealerships I spend twenty five years in the retail side over ten years as a general manager of a very large dealership\nAnd I had to train sales people at least if not monthly periodically I'm just how to calculate how much money someone makes when they make twelve dollars and fifty cents an hour is\nPretty simple equation now in today's market the market has changed it used to be when you have a certain credit score and they didn't care about anything and now all of a sudden they care about the debt that you have they care about the income that you have I have a friend of mine that\nAh when we see the markets are down twelve hundred points between Wednesday and Thursday\nUm when you know we think about this and we we say well that's quite a bit of a drop yeah it was about a five percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average and the other indexes the NASDAQ in the U.S and be five hundred\nA that's not uh the worst we've ever seen however is shocking when we see drops like that\nBut again our weekly economic update we do certainly give you a what's happening I as I mentioned over the past week so that obviously the weekly economic update this next coming which would be this Monday we'll talk a little bit about what occurred last week\nAs well as uh what his upcoming are moving forward\nAnd again you can sign up for that at our website at Grand canyon planning dot com\nAnd just go to the bottom and there's a little\nUh area for you to type in your email address and will drop that righty each and every week now part of that you're going to get some information we talk about some weekly tips financial pitch we talked about the riddle that we do each and every week\nUh hopefully you guys find them it'll be cute and hubris funny a challenging whatever maybe or maybe a little corny at times I think some of these metals are little corny I don't make them up I Will tell you but uh\nUh I Do uh go to them each and every week I should try to uh maybe have a little more input into some of these but that's OK and of course this past week while the stock market was dropping\nLike a lead balloon we saw hurricane Michael which was dropping on Florida a and hitting as one of the largest storms we've had in the U.S history and that was that I think it was the third strongest storm to hit the U.S\nAnd of course our thoughts and prayers go out with all of the people who are affected by that on Wednesday which was a pretty amazing a storm are now also a Nikki Haley\nResigned as us are UN ambassador\nAnd will be joining the private sector as of the end of two thousand and Eighteen another had been some talk about her resigning\nAnd I heard her speech um when she talked about why she was resigning and I think it kind of made sense could you imagine a running a a state as a governor and going through all of the challenges that you face as the governor of stayed\nWhether it's a she talked about hurricanes she talked about school shootings she talked about all of the other major issues that face with\nAs a governor and the stress of that type of position and then it becomes a UN ambassador of our great nation the United states of America and for her to be doing that for two years so back to back a total of eight years of\nService that she's given to this country and she said you know what I think I'm about ready for a little bit of a break\nAnd I think we could all appreciate that those of us who are out there working hard every day fighting the fight trying to make ends meet and trying to do the right thing out there for our sales for our family for our loved ones for a church and for all of the people out there that we're trying to help\n'em that sometimes you know what we just feel it's time you know I meet with a lot of people who are thinking for them it's time to retire so I think we have to give her credit for making this decision and she uh you know one of the thoughts was Jewish people were trying to speculate well maybe she's going to run for president\nI bet she er reassured everyone that that that's not her goal that she would be supporting President Trump if he decided to run for another term\nBut she said she would not be running for office at least that's not in the short term plans for her at the moment\nSo with all of these things happening culminating this week uh it was a busy week out there I Want to talk a little bit about um last week's rental real quick and then we're going to get into the meat and potatoes there's some things here\nUh you know last week I read I read all it said the more you take the more you leave behind what am I the more you take the more you leave behind what am I and the answer is foot steps right so the more you take the more you leave behind footsteps\nAnd this week's rental what rock group has four members\nBut neither of them saying what rock group has four members but neither of them saying so think about that one folks and again if you want to get that a weekly or read all the\nAnswer to it each and every weekend you're Monday morning email you can do that by signing up for the weekly economic update at Grand canyon planning dot com\nI folks are always I encourage you to if you haven't been to our website\nI'm right on the front page of our website there's a video and it's

our firm and feel like you've already been here by just watching that little video alright [noise]\nUm okay so as I mentioned the market's dropped drastically or this week it was it was a scary time I think for people when you think about\nThe markets as they climb over time so we if we think about the most recent poll back that we had similar to this I think you could go back or not too far a and too long ago\nAnd that was back right at the end of January of this year in early February we saw the markets take a really big pull back then about a ... plus percent pull back\nAnd a lot of people were concerned at that time as well or as I can understand you know I always say you know money it's easy for me to say or for anyone to say hey don't worry about it is going to come back right well it's your money in and of course you worry about it it's it's an emotional to you it's important to you\nAnd you know you get up every day and go to work in and do the things you need to do to support your family and none of us likes to open up our statements or look at our account online and and see red\nOr they're in our column that we should you know we'd want to see green\nA so it it is a nerve wracking it's scary and when we see a drop as drastic as we did on Wednesday and then ultimately again not quite as bad on Thursday or we do\nKind of think back and it brings back memories of even a two thousand seven and eight when we had the major financial crisis but I think if you are\nAt all watching or listening to what's happening out there and and the understanding what's going on in the economy today we are in a totally different place today than we were\nTen years ago so this is my opinion\nAs a financial professional I don't believe we are going to see that type of a major correction now can we still see a considerable dropped from here or or potential drop from here yeah there could be some additional pull back at this point\nBut I I Do believe we started to see a again Thursday even though we had a a you know the negative day and friday or we we started to see some buying occurring and we started to see a little bit more of that\nA balancing you know off the bottom and that's what we try to look for when we're trying to understand when we're close to a you know a bottom of\nA correction are we fully there yet possibly possibly not\nUh we're just gonna have to wait and see over the next few weeks but we have to think about moving forward here or if you're a contributing to your four O. one K. folks and you're getting paid every two weeks on a friday or whatever that day is that you get your paycheck\nAnd a portion of that paycheck is a hazard adoption attached to it which is going into your four O. one K. well all of a sudden you've got a position to where you are actually going to be I'm buying into the market at a lower level which is good for your overall average alright there's music folks were going to\nTake a short break when we come back from the break we'll continue the discussion and I'm trying to rescue this is the word on wealth as always check out our website Grand Canyon planning dot com we'll be back after this short break stay right here with us folks from\n[noise]\nThe theft leaps and show where the most important voices speak her good friend William J Bennett graduation over the coming on again friends and

story with us for simply sharing your story with us you will automatically be eligible to win a grand prize of an apple pie pat\nUh ... what would be a reason anyone would want to buy back stock maybe they felt good about their company and they thought that the company had a potential to go up in value and\nBy the company buying that stock retiring that stock there actually limiting the number of\nShare but like some big tech companies will do this like Apple's done this and others have done this in part because\nThey want to they want to lessen the amount of shares that are out there probably floated right while at the same time still being able to give shares to their employees and they got increasing the total ... along\nControl of that and one of the things Jonathan that was good about lower interest rates this is where this little uh issue with higher interest rates can affect companies as well if a apple wanted to buy ... shares or any company wanted to buy back their own shares\nOftentimes they don't even use their own money to do that how they get along they get a loan they borrow that money or or they'll float bonds\nOr to the public that the public and by that and they would have to pay interest but they're buying those shares with that money at low interest rates but as interest rates creep up folks this is where companies are going to have a larger expense internally\nAre also with wages as we see wages going up over the past couple of years\nUh this is inflationary and that also as we know corporate\nUh expenses are wages are one of the largest expenses that any company has and that is going to add to their expense so these types of things start to nibble into the growth of companies and expenses and the net income begins to drop that could be a challenge for some companies so it's important folks\nAs you're buying individual stocks if you are\nThat your understanding what's happening internally with these companies not just buying them for their momentum but buying them for what is the long term you know really playing with this company what are they doing a good turn all it's\nIt's good leadership and having good leadership and I know there's a stock you and I both really like I won't say the name but there's this talk to you and I both really like and\nWe liked the fundamentals we like the business plan with the potential in the future but it also it also comes down to we like the c._e._o. right the CEOs vision and you're like the way the CEOs executing division ... men so I think that's important right so it's not just you like the momentum of the stock\nBut fundamentally you say this company has good management right and they have a good product that we feel there's growth for that will that will be able to grow in the future despite all these other headwinds right but every company always deals with these headwinds innocent a side note\nAll companies are going to deal with rising wages because by the way we were in a situation which wages didn't rise for a long time I tried them seven we just didn't rise and so it's not just catching up\nRight and that's a good thing we all great but that is inflationary so that is worth our debt for Russia has a little challenging this is why it's important that uh the fed is is working closely watching closely will they raise red again in December don't know but they're scheduled to do so and they may\nStay play if you're going to have you hang over whether to extra pay out ...

has\nA title to it right folks to think of it this way I own a television but you know what a television is personal property it doesn't have a title to it if I Want to sell my TV to someone I can sell it to anybody I Want I could give it to anybody I Want and I don't have\nTo sign a piece of paper that's transferring that ownership now I could if I Want to do some type of a bill of sale for personal property and I can say I\nUh agreed to sell this television set to this person for this price and I could write the check number that the person gave me or they paid me cash or whatever and that's just an agreement between the two of us so in case there's any\nEver an issue of whether or not I sold the TV to someone I Would have proof of that so that's always good to have\nBut I'm Talking about ownership of an asset that absolutely cannot be transferred unless there's a change to some type of a title on it whether it's a deed for real estate a certificate of title for your automobile or a bank account whatever it is that actually has an ownership\nA title to it and for that purpose I'm going to bring on estate planning attorney Jonathan months with us today hey Jonathan how are you had John how are you oh it's a pretty good boy you got to get that ... has that better little bit better the guy like that better hey Jonathan so you heard me talk a little bit about\nUh

estate but ... why don't you give us a quick synopsis about what I just said either confirm or deny\nA that what I said has any truth or a or not to it\nSo the way that you can own things right right

that's probably more like I Need a hundred dollars a day with inflation was this from the sixties [laughter] dollar just doesn't even know who the issue is uh\n[noise] the Alamo of black is the uh ... it's an old one I don't know I just kind of that data you've ever had that on now I that that one up\nOut there somewhere so are always looking for fun different music but like I Need I Need a dollar two cars and then go buy a lottery ticket Mm [laughter] was fucking phase kid got a dream to you're going to be more [laughter]\nYou know Chris talking about the lottery that's not a probably a good way to a plan to retirement ... that you're going to win the lottery now and but but could you imagine win the lottery but almost be a burden\nIf you want like a five hundred million dollars what do you deal with the ah John I'll take that chance what'd you I'll take that chance I have a plan\nYou do I have a plan you have a plan for that I have a plan for how you buying tickets or actually I Do\nYou do I do every every once you're regularly very regular we'll have you ever won anything one two thousand dollars wow I Want eleven hundred dollar what'd you do with it or just rolled back into the laws that\nLand [laughter] five hundred million just run the juice thousand maybe next time I'll wind ten thousand oh my gosh you know I gave my I'll show you know I brought it home gave my wife some of it and my children so I'm a little bit of donations things like that so\nYeah so if you want five hundred million what would you do\nYou know I think about forty percent to forty five percent goes to taxes you know they ... I Would take the lump sum yeah\nAbout two hundred and twenty five million dollars I'd buy a bunch of municipal bonds is where I Know that I have my income tax free\nBy a very large chunk of property ... up north\nThose are beautiful cabin on it ... do a lot of travel I'd like to do a lot of charitable work ... with that uh don't even know necessarily me setting up a foundation you always hear about these\nSports figures over my foundation ground Asian I kinda find that eventually you're splitting up the pie too much so I think I Would focus on what I Believe our quality charity or whoever they do a good job right now just help fund them with their work\nVery good I hadn't thought about what I Do quest because you know when I played a lot of well you know I Do very rarely right we once in a while you know someone says hey I'm going to buy a ticket symptom five hundred million you want to sure I get my couple of bucks right my money but uh yeah I I don't that's not something that I ever count on and I haven't thought about it because I don't think it's gonna ever happened to me because I'm not trying\nNow and the other side of things if we think about\nHealth care and the cost of health care one of the things when I find people come to us about I'm retiring there they're thinking hey I'm ready to retire now\nAnd I say okay how old are your number one right one in the age and because we want to understand whether or not they're going to qualify for Social Security\nRight is that can be part of the income or maybe they've got a pension but if they're under the age of sixty five we also have to consider healthcare as part of the expense that they're going to have to cover until they hit that age of sixty five so for those out there who want to retire early\nThis is certainly something that needs to be considered\nIt every day it's getting more and more important as far as the health care costs is your employer or the giving you a buyout plant right and does that mean better also going to take care of your health insurance premiums as they had when you were a fulltime employee because as we all know health care is just becoming more and more expensive and\nGosh we've we've seen in a in the employment field as far as\nThe pay may not be so great but the health benefits are and people it it's that important that they're willing to take a little bit less per hour because the cost of health care\nHas gone through the roof so it's absolutely an important part of the plan right to get an idea how will you cover healthcare costs until you can jump onto a Medicare at age sixty five ... and it's just something that needs to be addressed and a lot of people are just not thinking about that\nYeah and um if you're in that position where you're thinking about retiring early I'm One of the things is number one for you and your spouse you've got to consider that right depending on what your spouse's maybe your spouse is still working we're thinking of retirement maybe your spouse's to working maybe you're that's a great great thing I mean if that's\nThat's a situation where one of you wants to continue to work\nGreat maybe you could go on that plan\nAnd maybe there's a way to cover that cost maybe there's it's a it's a less expensive way to go and certainly um you want to look at that and research to see if that's that's an option\nUh and if not then you've got to maybe look at did you contribute to a health savings account right so if you're thinking about retiring maybe you're sixty and you're thinking of retiring\nOh maybe sixty two are sixty three you've got three years one of the things you might want to consider doing in most companies will allow you to do this it depending on the plan is contribute to a health savings account if you can contribute to a health savings account Chris for the next two three four years you might be able to build up enough in that health savings account\nTo cover the cost of the premiums for the years up until the age of sixty five so it could be a solution to this if you could plan a little ahead\nAnd the health savings accounts it's a fantastic vehicle right\nAnd it gives you a lot of opportunities to save for your health on a tax free basis right 'cause you get to the doctor mhm yeah I don't want to play ... from it with my GPA or that it's it's tax deductible right and the nice thing is that it's meant for healthcare costs\nTo me and then if I Believe after the age of sixty five without health savings account can only be used just for health before that right after eight sixty five you can use it for anything\nRight you could actually draw down in ... yeah of course there's going to attacks of all the way it works like an IRA Vern myself right so if you're\nGetting to deduct it from your income even if you're contributing to an IRA if you're about fifty\nYou could put sixty five hundred dollars into that IRA or if you're contributing to your four one K.\nYou're going to be able to also contributes to a health savings account and reduce your tax liability by doing so and as you mentioned Chris if you're using that money for health issues for health care costs than it's tax free you're able to use it but if you do decide at some point in the future to use it as some type of supplement to retirement or income\nYes you'll have to pay taxes on it just like an IRA so but that's okay I mean if you haven't used it for health care taxes at some point in time we know that you know so very good All right Chris as far as preparation for the change I Want to talk about preparation for change of employment and this is something I see often were folks come into us\nBecause they're changing their job and they want to know what their options are and when it comes to their retirement accounts that they have\nAnd usually if someone maybe who's fifty fifty five years old now they've been working with the company now for maybe ten Fifteen Years and all of a sudden there's a change maybe the the company that they're with\nIs downsizing maybe they're changing a focus on something and the team that they were working with is no longer going to be needed and what winds up happening is is they\nGet rest right mhm reduction in force\nAnd they get some type of a package possibly but the thought is okay now that I have is what do I do from here we may have a four O. one K. we may have some stock options and we may have some other type of pension plan that's part of it is what do we do Chris how does it all has it all work out at that point\nI think we absolutely before you make any decisions on anything I Would certainly asking an offer that opportunity to give us a call\nAnd let's sit down and let's take a review well water all your job options out there are you looking for another job and maybe it's Chris John drive a possibility of retiring right now we have to take a look at those things certainly were below that fifty nine and a half\n... we don't want to necessarily go tapping into those IRAs there are ways to do it right where we don't pay penalties it's certainly a conversation that we can have\nOf how do we stretch you to getting Social Security but we're going to take a look at your four O. one K. app pensions at cash mhm as well as health care and how are you going to maintain health insurance premiums et cetera\nHere's a person you could talk to so we'll see we'll see\nSilly now yeah so you didn't I mean I commend that because well let me just give you an example so working with retirees they have really you know cool bucket list and then every day I get a different idea one day I came home and said to my husband you know what\nMaybe we'll just get an RV and travel around the country there is some states we haven't seen the new I looked\nAt me and I laugh at your shoes will not fit those days of you roughing it like when we were younger I yeah I think it was right so you didn't even have to heat it for five minutes even walk down the past like you did\n... admitted that now that's\nInteresting no heard of but I Want to laugh about that later I'm Sorry just well\nYou can add it to your list of unusual retirement goals I'm sure you've probably heard some crazy maybe he's not\nA fair one you've probably heard some pretty out their ideas or some pretty fine just outside of the box things that\nPeople on average daily but that's really cool that he's starting to think about that and that's a good point to really delve into the show because you guys got lucky is if that if you start exploring all jokes aside and decide gee this is something that can be really really\nCool and you can figure out you know what are we going to do to get there you know how much do we have to accumulate yeah what's this going to be like but you're in that phase that\nIt's going to be all about when you start getting those goals together accumulating that money and growing that money for the long term down the road when you actually start hurting those buffalo [laughter]\nThat's right yeah\nYeah when people come in to see me hopefully they've started to really manifests what they want their retirement to look like and now how do we take the money that we've accumulated and realistically make that happen\nRight so tell me if we're talking with Phyllis ... she founder and president of the SPN associates Phyllis tell me about the people who typically coming to you where\nAre they are they just to the point where they have done that saving and they've got their retirement savings they just don't know how to make those retirement dream to reality or do they not even have their retirement goals outlined yet where are people typically when they come into you\nWell ... they still only ... usually they've done the accumulating as I say on this show they've done some of the heavy lifting mhm and they've\nBegun to have the conversation or they know like I Want to Gulf or want to see the grand kids want to take them on a vacation each year usually two schools of thought swear school of thought is we're going to spend less\nThan when we worked so if we're bringing in the door or a hundred thousand I'm just making up numbers were only going to need eighty 'cause we're not going to have to do dry cleaning we won't be habit of by the wardrobe\nThat we do know orders the other school of thought that oh we're going to do this we're going to do that we're going to do this we're going to do that so the first place that we really have to start is understanding what we want retirement to look like what's really going to cost us in today's dollars\nAnd definitely go ahead and make sure that we take into account inflation so we got to get\nPicture painted I can tell you is when someone says I Want to take a cruise there's all different types of cruises you know I'm thinking of one couple ... they wanted to take a around the world cruise whoa okay hundred and eighty days awesome ... really expensive and we didn't\nThat out too well into a couple of meetings about what they want her to do in retirement so we had a good idea of how much they were going to travel you know you learn this was early on as ...\nTo really help people create retirement plans and we've got a budget and they're pretty comfortable with it and then somewhere in the conversation we start realizing that they want this very exotic expensive trip to happen\nAnd that kinda through the whole budget off what ended up happening is this is an important dream for him and we flushed it out he ended up working a little bit part time in a grocery store and saving that money for more years mhm\nAnd yeah they had an excellent excellent around the world cruise and you know what I'll leave some shoes little home so that I can go take that Harry\n... and self I'd like to tell you that\nSo that's a first step in our process is really helping people flushed out what they want to do and understanding what we need the money to do so that we can make this happen and you've done the heavy lifting you worked your entire life let's make sure\nThat we have realistic expectations and we can build a plan that allows you to do what's realistic\nAnd what you really want to do in retirement that's what I retire fit analysis was all about the first part is really flushing out what do we want our retirement to look like realistically what are the costs associated with that and then we're in a position the way that we are set up to make those dreams realistic\nAnd if not how can we make adjustments to do that\nRetire fit in that list is put you in control\nThat's why if you've done the heavy lifting and you want to make sure that everything that you've worked for those dreams often the distances Buffalo's down the road are going to become a reality we need to make sure that we have a plan that supports that so you want to pick up the phone and call us for that retire fit analysis\nIt's complimentary there's no obligation we'll start with figuring out what your dreams are and then looking to make sure that what you've accumulated we can now position so that we can make those dreams of reality for sure are going to tell you that whatever it is but it all starts with a retired fit analysis and you need to pick up the phone and call us\nAt six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again if you're\nClose to retirement even if you're in retirement and you want to make sure that you're in a position to live life on your terms independently on your own terms we've got to make sure that you have a plan in place that your money's doing what it needs to do to support what your goals are so the number to call us\nIs six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six\nCell is actually this is founder and president if he SPN associates I in generally jak alongside in a studio fellas gave me the phone number of the website is retire with P. S. P. dot com if you'd like to learn a little bit more today we're talking about how important it is to plan for specific goals and how\nWe can do that and tell us I just think it's so important that people understand this process that goes into planning for\nAnd preparing for retirement because you are not about products at your office this is not something where we come in and we say hey I think I'd like to retire and you lay out a bunch of brochures\nYou really have to take the time to have those conversations and to develop relationships with clients so you do fully understand\nWhat you're hoping to do here's where you're going to need income here's what we're going to need a little bit more income and helping them playing for some of these things like inflation that we might not think about if we've always wanted to buy a boat in retirement we have to think about what that both my car once we added\nOccasions of we're going to take the money from where I go to admit it it makes me sick when people come into my office and they're told that they have a retirement plan because they have some pretty cool tools yeah you know your tools for your dreams and your stage of life are going to be all about gross\nThey're going to be all about girl the Getty entirely different than the tools that someone should be using at\nMy stage should I say within certain period of time or you know ten years of retirement or further entirely different because the goals when people come to see me\nTheir goals are different now they've accumulated most of what they need for retirement and they've got to keep it they've got to get some income from it to replace the paycheck to maintain their lifestyle upset at one subset at five million times cash flow of Kenyan retirement they've got to keep that principle safe because\nThey're not going to get do overseas and not going to get it back\nYou know because they're not working anymore they've got to keep what they've accumulated and they've got to grow at at least a little bit because of inflation never sleeps never asleep so we've got to understand that first we go to define what we want that to look like and then we got to make sure that the tools we pick last but not least\nSupport what we need the money to do so you write build the clean first and then the tools are easy too often people come in and say yeah I have no problem I've got X amount of dollars and this is how much we need a year and we're just taking it out of here here and here\nAnd they're not looking at future tax consequences coming down the road and you know looking about the fact that if the market corrects they're just going to lose twenty five percent of their portfolio they're not looking at any of those facts that's not a plan they got pretty performance records right now or you know pretty products but they don't have\nA plan a plan is let's get to know what you want your retirement to look like let's figure out what realistically going to cost you let them sleep that\nYou know let's take into account that if I meet you today ten years from now you're going to need more money just to stay even ... and then\nLet's put your money in the right places with the right risk tolerance to support your goals and if there are any gap side of the gate let's say like the Bryant the clients who wanted that tour around the world the cruise around the world\nThey understood from the get go we don't have enough money to do this and everything else\nSo we're gonna work for three years to make sure that we have it he worked part time let's do it on the front end that's what a realistic plan is in in our job is to guide you through that process the first process\nAnd as you transition into retirement what you've accumulated you've got to put it in the smartest places to make sure those dreams become a reality right just you know retirement and general becomes a reality and that is our focus\nTotally different goals totally different set of strategies totally different sets of tools there are new tools that are created you know not everybody's going to want to use the same tools but yeah we get a break that down and it really in our specialty it really starts with understanding really\nDelving in to how you want it to be\nAnd then really educating knew about exactly where you are relationship to your goals to see if there's any any gaps retire fit analysis does exactly that we take the time\nTo understand how you want to play golf where you want to play or how you want to take a cruise\nWhat you want to do with your grandchildren do you know we were talking about Disney how you went to Disney [laughter] I Know I'll I took my kids to ... what do you want that experience to look like because it was cute but you said your parents wanted by each of your kids or soda whereas you may have been sharing it [laughter]\nYeah if I Want to buy each of my kids grandbabies or soda if that's important to me that costs a lot more than a foregone a share one yeah all of those things on the front end to make it to see if it's a reality\nThe retired fit analysis does into that that it takes a look at everything going on in your plan as it is now educates you on any gaps\nAnd then if there are gaps\nThat you want to fix we can show you how to do that with the tools that exists\nBut it all starts with if you've done

that they weren't prepared for have to pay a lot more taxes than they thought\nTrigger the Medicare part B ND going up significantly and by the time we were done they had a different outlook on that

P. S. P. and associates retire with the S. P. dot com is a website if you'd like to learn a little bit more\nToday we've been talking about how to plan for specific retirement goals so many of you have retirement goals and dreams that go beyond the basics of being able to pay the bills and sometimes\nThese things get rather complicated and fill us we've talked a little bit today about this couple who came to you and one of their goals for retirement was to be able to take a world's crews\nAnd I wonder if someone had come to you if they had come to you and they said here's what we want to do here is how much is going to cost ... what would have happened if you just would have said\nOkay here it is here's this fifty thousand dollars that you need for this world cruise without any further discussion that and\nI shudder to think what would I ... honestly I mean that's why this is a specialty first of all it didn't necessarily come out right away it kinda got pulled out in the conversation\nOkay that they are going to do this okay and that happens very often because you just kind of take it for granted dirty working is they had their own business and they did well when they wanted to do something they just kind of did it but they just didn't think that it would even be an issue that we can never\nDo that we always start with the end in mind and we dig and dig and dig and we figure that out and what we're able to show them is based upon their goals when we had them and what that was going to cause than what everything else was going to cost and what they had saved the probability\nFor making it through retirement realistically with all the things that they could base we do a simulation that shows and the probability of success was a lot lower than they were comfortable with\nAnd they could have had major problems okay so\nWe did that on the front and now they were able to say okay well look this is a non negotiable we really want to do this and then we started brainstorming about different ways that they could accomplish it they could give up other things and then the and\nThe biggest thing for them to delay it a few more years and husband actually loved doing his part time gig in a grocery store got to meet the bugs and joke\nAround and all that money went away and that plus other dollars that they were able to allocate paid for the whole thing but it could have spell disaster they could have gone on that trip\nAnd then eventually you know when they didn't have choices been in trouble so our approach again this the first figure out what it is you're trying to accomplish really dig\nAnd figure out how you do things why you want to do what's negotiable what isn't in the ghost shovel and based upon what you've got going on show your probability of success how like play in all\nOf different situations because there's anybody realize life throws a curve [laughter] things happened the job market's tanked health tanks you know we hope for the best but it doesn't always happen so", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "13"}
