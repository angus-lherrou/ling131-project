your\nVoice challenge but eager to talk with my next guest David ... is the director of the brand new movie in the visible which will be in theaters this Friday the true story of army chaplain Darren Turner a David Evans welcomes great to have you on the Hugh Hewitt she'll tell us about indivisible\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really hear the first movie ever made about a military chaplain you know there's been chaplains that have been featured with with supporting roles in movies over the years but um I've heard about this story about chaplain Darren Turner and his wife about six years ago\nI'd taken a long time to get this project put together but I'm\nReally it's an incredible story that I think will appeal to your listeners when you can see what troops experienced during times of deployment through the eyes of a chaplain who's really kind of like the pastor to the troops\nBut when you first hand or the experience of what they're dealing with up and then you know at the same time their marriage as well as under attack as it is so often with\nWith our troops when they leave their husbands and wives behind a\nJust a powerful story of of of the people who whether you're married or not it's a story that's really going to speak to you um when you see this film\nDavid Evans I've got lots of military and my family and I've heard it said again and again I'm a civilian American record brat and just lots of military active duty\nThat whenever a soldier sailor airman or Marine Corps um and go off on deployment they come back a different man or woman and their spouse is a different man or woman and they laughed to capture that in indivisible\nAbsolutely in in a in a very vivid accurate way I Believe we use the chaplains actual journal that he kept while he was in Iraq so we kind of get into into what they're going through by by reading his journal and and then incorporating that into our entire script you know so often that\nI'm as Americans we take for granted that the freedoms that we have and it's really about one percent of the population that that's connected directly to the military through a spouse who serving or having a child who's an active duty\nPurchase other Ninety nine percent of people that I think really are going to appreciate the story a yet yet entertainment value to great visual effects and and a score\nBut it's that it's the deep rooted story about what our troops are going through that I think will really speak to people\nAnd um I'd like to also and you it's a perfect\nDate movie if there's a husband or wife out there and they're your your your listeners are looking for something to do this weekend or you know you can cast a vote for for faith based quality films like this by going to see the movie on opening weekend the perfect perfect film for\nFor husbands and wives to go out and watch together\nAnd this is the studio that also brought out by a group in war roommate really succeeds they make wonderful movies as says of course David Evans it got very experienced directorial credits\nBut what strikes me is especially if you have a member of the military and your family whether it's a son or daughter husband and wife grandma grandpa anyone who deploys I Want you to go see this movie so that you understand what you're friends with someone\nYou go to church with someone who's got a spouse deployed understand how hard it is for that spouse as well as for the frontline soldier sailor airman marine coast guard but that\nIs you know I think indivisible has got a lot of great stuff going forward with Sarah\nTruant and Justin ruining it David evidence but what's really got going for it as an audience that's going to finally see their lives reflected on the screen\nYes here which we've heard that over and over again from some of the military screenings and and community screenings were done already is people say that was me in that scene I saw myself on the screen\nAnd you know with Veterans Day coming up just a couple of weeks away that's a great opportunity for someone that you've seen the film to say you know what I Know someone who needs to see this and go out and give them a ticket and say thank you for your service\nAnd uh it's something that that really all of us needs experience because it's not so often that like this are the film can come along based on a true story of a military couple uh especially one told through the eyes of a chapel and\nI Love the alliance defending freedom great sports of our show has a separate group devoted just to chaplains in chaplains very rarely get the credit which they ... they are in every battlefield they're on every front line taking care of the men and women the trips and I'm Glad someone finally made a movie about David thank you\nThank thank you so much yeah it's it's an important role in like you said one we often take for granted but in the case of chaplain Darren Turner he's in Iraq dealing with the problems facing a thousand troops\nAnd ah you know his own relationship begins to to deteriorate with his own spouse and that's what we see kind of play out in the film and how how um they're able to piece things back together and and today they go round counseling other couples that military marriage or treats around the country which is another great thing that people really are not aware of that happening\nThe Boswell mortgage Steve was well done mortgage equalizing lender ... to Ninety two\nIn the mail I just want us to have one easy because you're on on once you're winning

previous times I looked at the red scare at the turn of the right after World War two we went after well I Want actually and then you look at that period of time at the turn of the twentieth century and it was so much anxiety and the land and yet there was a sense of the industrial revolution I think having shake it up the economy much like the tech revolution\nGlobalization of done today it really echoed in some ways and I keep thinking how we handle that that is what could be a model for us now\nI mean think of family lawyer at the turn of the twentieth century um gap between the rich

think of judging are you a better or worse off having been here for two years than simply the material goods that are at the bottom which absolutely important as well\nSo we'll see what happens if that shift if that gets worse if the polarization deep and if it leads into even more violence as we might be seeing potentially in these last couple of days and I think we have to use that as a standard for its leader leading us in a direction\nThat is helping us become a better country or is or if the discourse that he's not only was hot spot for but it is escalating under his watch and
