your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so stress affects the body as this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right at the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries that go up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are result in in in a heart disease digestive\nDifficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that is completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and\nHow many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel for this and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their\nHow many an apathy chew it has\nTo do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah it does build your ... but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidney their organs and your body shutdown actually dies\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't a diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if ... that's right but I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of front an intrusion yup okay\nAnd so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated hum the calcium at least from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer right but these things don't absorb and the body that's up for a couple of reasons\nOne when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in it like a dumb\nFirst of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but to see what happens when you take a Tom isn't antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the count max formula\nBy combat formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that\nPowder and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's also a problem with\nWell yeah because when Cal say many of them are in a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says affairs absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eighty two three eight eight five seven I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred eighty two three eight eight\nFive seven well if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael pick us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their\nBond [laughter] well that's the thing is that a deficiencies are not like I'm going to have a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little trips a little leaks here and there and so we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill a little bit at a time be up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] document as you mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium any of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take the comments formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a desk in my back in ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or even even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't it amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady\nWas suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I are the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just to the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright you had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer me out to her friends\nSo that is amazing and when I use is with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their mothers' we're in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact on the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years of the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication is that\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium museum in the system well very drugs that are training the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the mission and many of them is also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's it's really it's really a rat race look it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things

talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule cold\nKorea Team now pat a lot of our listeners may have heard of crazy and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly use in the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders\nCollege high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's or Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger\nMore powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nCan you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nShort pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system and its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power\nIt's in every single show on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the power's off the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf kind of anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their higher energy state so they're strong\nAnd ready for action packed\nHere's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had all the stuff that was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies meet a lot of it but as we get older\nLike everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that wouldn't you supplement with Korea Team he goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger\nYou get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health\nAnd it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how eliminated athletes have been using Korea teen for years to enhance their strength and performance\nTell me more well this Korea Team is the premier sports\nNutrition supplement there's no question about that how you've used the body builders know about it athletes know about Korea Team is the premier\nSports nutrition and so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach was of course he knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes\nTo enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing that for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it every strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in space stronger with hundreds of human studies and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient and I put 'em on average strong you noticed it benefits almost right away because they've been so low and if you're if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general this is for you you definitely want to add that average grow\nSo obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle and Hansing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus or like you and me pat let's go to a couple of studies
