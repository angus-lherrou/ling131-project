him to look for in a UN ambassador\nWell before we look at the future let me say how how grateful we all our president myself our entire\nAdministration for the extraordinary job or that ambassador Nikki Haley is done for the United states at the United nations or she is a she has to get them\nTaken the president's America First agenda\nUh carried it into the the floor of the United nations should choose to travel around the globe\nAdvocating American interest uh and we will miss her in this role she is a personal friend of mine and\nShe and I spent a little bit of time or after she was in the oval office with the president and I just I just tell a person that grateful I was uh for for not only the job she's done but the way she is the way she's done it a with courage and character and grace and we wish her and her family every blessing and the years ahead you\nVery tough act to follow so how do you follow it why they can all be\nSitting in for the president but uh there are a number of men and women are that ah that that would be a very qualified very able to follow on in that role but what I can promise you as the policies aren't going to change I mean one\nOf one of the things that it does is I think than than most uh uh admirable about the job that ambassador Haley did at the United nations that are secretary's day my ... my ... who is doing now in John Bolton was doing [noise]\nIs is every single one of these folks and gets up every day or to carry the agenda that we were elected to advance\nOn behalf of the American people that America First agenda on to the world stage and so we're we're we're looking for folks that are that are not only can follow in the big issues that Nikki Haley sent to leave at the un but we're we're going to be looking we're going to be looking to fill that spot a with someone who comes in with just as much bigger to advance\nAmerica's interest to advance the America First agenda and to and to continue to see of\nAmerica um respected again on the world stage you know Nikki made that comment in the oval office\nToday and I I can tell you\nHad the opportunity to travel around\nThe world over the last two years few um and I'll be headed to the Asia Pacific here and in about a month\nOr as a as I've met with world leaders as I have witnessed a response to President Trump's leadership\nUh on on the world stage there is no doubt that America is respected again and that is a credit to the president to the entire team and and uh and we are so grateful for the contribution to Nikki Haley's made to that causes well\nIt does take some spark on some charisma like ambassador Haley that's why I bring up Grinnell Robert O'Brien and James ... we got to have some sparkle there\nWell look it's a it's the United nations is a big stage\nAnd are having having the right talent they're all of those people are are outstanding people or other people that are actually the ... there's a great number of people that have already
