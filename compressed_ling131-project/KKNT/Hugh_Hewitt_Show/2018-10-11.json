that's that's like a certain number one thing checked ... dino out of a win but I think it goes to this militant normal phenomenon that you've been talking about and and explain for people who live in a cave what a militant normal it's\nOK normal people were ... you know she were or are the kind of people don't spend all their time on politics they're too busy building this country feeding it feeling at even defending than the regular folks who\nWho cross the elite to go you know run our country what our institutions I Want security and prosperity as long as you do that you take a little

while and this is not new and it just seems gotten worse how do they fix it by November sex yeah I mean I think that's the most potent potential\nProblem that Trump has brought to them it turns out that tension Harlem I let her I said my friend I look I think he had taken a group of maybe swing flash\nSlightly right leaning white college educated ex urban women and mom and\nShipping them to more fully swing voters or even folks who will lean left in the future and that is a problem particularly in these vulnerable house seats I Will say also though that this cannot buy it I think people are potentially underestimating how much it did energize\nRepublicans on the other side including Republican women um and the issue for Democrats I think it's at their enthusiasm was already here it was already way up here and art and the Republican Party is added to bring parity and so I think they actually do have a chance to gain a bit\nAnd it won't matter more in Senate races and it doesn't have vulnerable house races where\nThose women really mattered switching last share and and tear pointed out energizing that Republicans and in Europe than Republican women that do you think that really a

already upset about all the other thing Donald Trump and the Democrats were motivated\nPassionate angry sure they are either going to turn out or they are not Republicans there the team that needed
