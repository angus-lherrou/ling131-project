now\nBy Josh crush or Josh you can hear my voice is shot but I got one question for you I think the wind is if the Republicans back and my right\nOr you know I I I think they've gotten a boost in Alaska ... and it's given them the opportunity to pick up a few Senate seats to expand their dirty which can be awfully important in the long term I could actually get the Senate as a sort of a bulwark against possible democratic gains elsewhere\nAnd you know I think the field for Democrats has gotten to\nA lower but I still think the pathway to a twenty four seats and to pick it up a twenty four seats are majority I think that bill it as realistic at that was a few weeks ago so I think the house that we were like a narrow majority for the Democrats most likely MSN and I'd I'd say about his pickup for the Republican but with all set that\nNo I think I'm more optimistic in the Senate because of trends but uh the house I Can't call anymore I used to say it was going to go democratic but the combination and I I Will let out the cabinet I bumped\nCombined with the assault on Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell and the cheap Locy combined with this caravan of all sort of solidified the issue set\nIn a very ... and the unemployment numbers and the earnings reports they've all you know sort of come in for the Republicans at the end here Josh and voters notice\nSo here but big get somebody to NBC Wall Street Journal poll that we all look at very closely\nDemocrats had a pretty good favorability rating the party images pretty solid a month ago\nIt's negative nine which is even lower than the Republican Party image which is pretty remarkable I think you're right that that's attributable to the cabinet with their their their their tactics off Kavanaugh at some of the radical elements party kind of show their face for the last month\nI also think that it's pretty remarkable that Republicans have a few quite advantage I watched part is better equipped to handle the economy at the largest advantage for any already in the history of the NBC Wall Street Journal poll so we had all of the economy is that was really the driving force in this election\nBut it definitely has given tropical birds and it's definitely give her a little bit of wind up you know we're a little bit of um at the Republican\nAnd let me ask you Peggy Noonan wrote this weekend that one of the great advantages of the Republicans have is the media is so obviously hating on Donald Trump and that there's a recording oh in the public at large when they see a twenty four seven media against one party agree or disagree\n[noise] you know I I think that showed itself in like having a hearing the cap you know when the when the media was bringing up questions about whether he was drunk and college and kind of we're kind of\n... I think that I totally I was actually just in California reporting on a level the rational racism Southern California and there was a lot I mean I was surprised the hearing some sort of independent minded voters have have some evidence on how the Democrats and even the cover of the cabin out here but\nLook I think I think people are so polarized too that you know it it you know they don't trust them anything they hear a they they really haven't gotten to the battle stages of just gotta look with a partisan rhetoric out there so I don't think there's a there's a whole lot of truck\nOr of the Democratic side towards President Trump they don't believe anything he says but I think a lot of Republicans will trust what they ...\nMy last question my friend Mimi Walters is a very influential in rising star in a very effective congresswoman or I Can't vote for any more 'cause I had moved to Virginia I Would vote for or otherwise is she going to pull it out it would be it would be stupid not to send Mimi Walters back to Congress she so influential\nSo I interviewed covers her while I was actually out there that I wrote a piece that covered that that race I mean it's a it's a tough one for Republicans as one of the burden for the district suburban district it's always been a Republican but there are a lot of anti a lot of anti Trump Republicans out there are the best hope that Republicans have is if a Democrat\nIs lower than any quarter a law professor who was posed with Elizabeth Warren she's too little to the to the left of where most people are that district and that that's the one hope that Republicans have I Would try to I mean you can order the Democratic she didn't want to answer any questions you want to talk about policy and you know Republicans that are going to win that district they really end up in our data where she stands\nWe're bringing back our popular free seminars and on October twenty four I'll be at the Scottsdale double tree resort\nWe're
