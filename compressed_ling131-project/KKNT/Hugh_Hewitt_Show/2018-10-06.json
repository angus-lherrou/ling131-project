{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "That my wife brought home and surprise me with that I wasn't expecting and that's what prompted the content for today's show because I thought you know I hate surprises I just hate surprises and you know most of our clients hate surprise us especially when it comes to their life savings\nAnd so we've talked to already on the show about don't be surprised with your taxes we just had the largest tax reform since the Reagan Administration when's the last time your financial advisor reviewed your return if you can honestly tell me my advisor haven't looked at my return since December when we just had the biggest change in taxes since the Reagan Administration fire them\nI Know it sounds harsh but you're paying a financial adviser and I am putting up air quotes\nTo be your financial adviser and give you guidance\nAnd they're more interested in selling you non traded recent variable annuities and all these other vehicles that make them commissions rather than talking about how to reduce taxes type of surprised\nTo get ready for this prize your lifetime when you're sitting in twenty thirty and tax rates skyrocketed and you're looking back on two dozen Eighteen through two thousand twenty five going wow why didn't I Do X Y Z with my money and you'll go oh yeah 'cause my advisor\nWho was really awesome it's taking me golfing and throwing great Christmas parties\nSelling me a bunch of investment stuff they never talked to me about tax because one they're not an expert in tax and two it doesn't make them any money to talk to me about it and since my CPA just basically files my taxes they never call me in the middle of the summer and share with me ideas of what I can be doing my taxes\nYou're basically if you're like most Americans you're totally gone about this alone that's one of the huge things we do on the retire map review and what we do for our existing clients within their financial planning your you still want partners is discuss your tax strategies in some cases the most impactful things you'll do with your money if you're like most Americans\nYou probably think about your portfolio most of it's an IRAs and CSP isn't fourth reviews them for one case and a bunch of different accounts that you're going to have to pay tax on between now and the day you die and it's Seventy and a half the iris is gonna make you take money out to pay tax on it\nBut right now we just had taxes lower in the midst of twenty trillion dollars of national debt any Social Security crisis is under funded if you don't pay taxes are going up over the next Thirty years from where they are today\nYou're out of your mind and in light of that if they're not going to go down what are you doing right now to hedge against that if you need to know that go to our website ... partners dot com\nClick on the button that said I'd like a retirement purview and schedule what hundreds of others have done just like you are one hour session with us we will produce a one page roadmap to overuse your whole financial situation and part of that will be looking at all your tax strategy also looking at your fees and expensive that's what we just talked about before the break\nMost do you have no idea what your pain because most of what you pay is internal and hidden and unless somebody breaks it out for you or you read every word of every perspective that comes to you in the mail which I Know you don't you don't know what it is so what's the third area that I don't want you surprised when it comes to your life savings risk\nHow many have you were surprised in two thousand and eat your accounts went down a little more than you are comfortable with what about oh one when the dot com bubble burst you see as you get near or into retirement are typical client around here a key sounds around sixty years old when you're sixty years old do you think you want to be surprised by having way more risk than you think you had\nThan you thought you had to ... and it can be detrimental if you have too much volatility not listen if you're sixty you're probably going to live another thirty or forty years so what I'm not suggesting is put all of it and fixed income and CDs and fixed annuities because you can't have any risk I mean and again I'm painting with a very broad brush I'm not looking right now your specific situation so take this with a grain of salt but the reality is\nYou're going to need some growth and you probably do need to have some exposure to some growth oriented assets if you're sixty years old because your needs some growth to make sure you don't run out of money and you keep up with inflation if you live too long and rising healthcare costs and all those other things\nBut you probably also can't afford to suffer a forty percent drop in the market at six years old await happens again if you want to retire and two or three years or four years or five years right\nSo now is a really good time to evaluate your risk why we've got a nine year bull market\nWe've had an incredible run so right now is a great chance for you to pause and go I really should evaluate if I Need to take somebody winnings off the table right now\nNot because you're guessing or forecasting they're projecting the next year we're going to have a crash 'cause nobody knows that but simply because you want to look at your long term goals and say wow maybe I Need to be a little bit less risky simply because I Want to retire sooner\nAnd I found that when we meet with people and I say have an overweight scenario happened with your portfolio\nWhat would happen to your account like about how much would you go down and if you're listening right now and you're like most of the people I meet with your thinking I don't really know I'm not really sure what my percentages that I'd go down that's a problem because when a weight does occur and it's not if it's when right at some point over the next\nThirty years of your retirement it'll happen you better be prepared and know what to expect or you will be incredibly vulnerable\nTo making very emotional decisions one of the things we do in our retirement preview and all of our clients have is we gave you a risk score we tell you one through Ninety nine Ninety nine being everything's in one tiny small cap stock or one would be everything's in cash\nAnd CDs and fixing ... we tell you exactly what your current portfolios risk number in and exactly what that would look like in previous scenario how much would you have gone up in a few thousand Thirteen scenario how much would you have gone down during the financial collapse what would happen if interest rates roads will share with you relative to how you're currently structured\nWhat your restore is and whether that's appropriate for you in our opinion\nWouldn't that be nice and again you can request that by going to Keystone both partners dot com right now clicked on the button that says it like a retirement review we have offices in Chandler is well Scottsdale and we are a group of reform brokers\nCommitted to helping you live your best life and not be surprised when it comes to your life savings and frankly for most people will be the first time you've ever sat down with a credential do share he was not looking to sell you something I hate to be blunt but that's the truth of it would it be nice to get a second opinion from an objective credential do Sherry\nWho left their bank broker dealer insurance company 'cause we don't want to do it that way anymore if you'd like that again go to Keystone well partners dot com let's not have any surprises related to your taxes you're fees or your wrist and the last thing is your income now I've heard a lot of shows talk all about essentially you need to put everything in insurance contracts to guarantee that you'll have income\nWe don't have time for me to totally unpack that\nBut that's not what I'm Talking about here today I'm not leading you into a you better be prepared for your income so everything needs to go to insurance contracts so you know what to expect\nBut here's the deal if you're depending on a certain amount of income in retirement and you've crafted a strategy around that to make sure you can pay bills and travel and have the legacy planning that you want to pass the kids and charities you care about\nWhen you're in retirement and your paycheck stops you better know what ever the strategy is that your advisors put together I don't ... David in stocks maybe it's a combination of fixed income and your equities maybe it's divest seen as some shares periodically maybe it's segment now some in cash and that's what you drawdown of a short period of time maybe some of it's in\nGuaranteed annuity contracts I mean it may be a variety of strategies we have a way we do it which will talk to you about will shed some light on how we help our clients have confidence and not be surprised but at the end of the day regardless of what your strategy is here's what you don't want to have\nHappen you're in your seventies and all of a sudden you go whoa either my income checked didn't show up this month\nFor its smaller or this income if we keep getting is going to run us out of money we won't receive this income check forever because if we lived too long our money is going to run\nOut you don't want that surprise and so we provide you over the course of our relationship what we call your funding score and what that is as we assessed your current situation we backed tested in times of heightened volatility and we look at\nWhat is the likelihood that your income check\nCan stay the same or grow over the rest of your lifetime what the strategy you have in place wouldn't it be nice that perspective on what you've worked her whole lifetime to save the reality is\nYou have really unique goals in a unique life that's specific to you and we understand that but you know way every single one of our clients number one goal is hey John I don't want to live with my kids basement\nI don't want to be alive and out of money every other goals that I tell you in every other thing that matters to me and my life is secondary\nTo making sure that I never run out of money\nAnd so I Know that's how you feel 'cause that's how everybody feels and you need to not be surprised related your income and are you right now one hundred percent certain that your plan will hold up regardless of what happens with interest rates or the market\nOr the trade wars and volatility in what Trump tweets tomorrow and whatever it is I mean if those things have you concerned that you may actually not have enough or what\nAbout this what if there's really simple things you could do to increase your income that might be nice and retirement we'll look at that as well when you come in for your retirement preview\nSo again to close the show I hate surprises my wife loves surprises I don't know which camp you fall into the one thing I Do know is you definitely have surprises when it comes to your taxes\nYou're fees your risk and your retirement income and so because of that I don't want you to be ...\nThis is one of the reasons I started Keystone while partners and I left my broker dealer and I have banned in that way of doing it\nIs I Want you to have assurance and confidence in what you're doing and I want to make that available to you through what we call her retirement from you it's called the retirement map for a reason it's our one page road map\nAnd overviews your whole financial situation and for many of you to be the first time you've ever sat down with a credential produce you're not affiliated with a brokered your not looking to sell you things but actually give you a clear\nAnd an understandable breakdown of where you stand we have done this at our offices in Chandler in Scottsdale for hundreds of radio fans just like you\nMany of whom did not become ongoing climbs of Houston while partners they came in we went through the analysis we were able to give them more clarity and a second opinion around their money on things like income taxes fees and expenses\nRisk tolerance and I know it helped them have more understanding of what they're doing that's my passion if you need our help after the map all share with you how we help you we'd love to work with you if it's a good thing but if it's not that the okay to call us down the road but the retirement map is available for you right now by calling one eight hundred\nIf you're dead set on sending an email you can go to the your car insiders website and there's a submission form there you can send that I Will receive it I'll be responding from Gary Green one er Cox dot net real fast on that I'm One of the reasons why we we recommend that you call\nIs when someone typically sends an email they'll have a few questions and of course will respond to those questions which then generates more questions and and the reality is in a brief conversation if you ask questions and then we're happy\nTo answer the questions but I'm not I'm telling you now I'm not the guy to sit in front of the computer and the answer Fifteen questions\nAnd and and realistically in when phone conversation we can answer all your questions\nAnd this is what I tell people if you're going to call us just to make sure you don't forget anything write down what you're planning on asking\nOr if we have a conversation you want to call back right down because the most important question is the one sometimes you forget to ask but here's an article that was on MSN in the u._s. news article and it says seven best new cars under Fifteen thousand dollars\nSo number seven I've never help anybody by one Mitsubishi Mirage and I'm not sure that I Would help somebody by one\nAnd and just shorten the same page as you go through these I'd like to participate and I'm going to say that I've also never helped any one by one of those cars and I don't suspect I ever will Nissan Versa\nI've helped a few people and it's arguably a not a good car however\nIt can be really really cheap I talked to a couple of people get them but I Would guide people to look at other things one hundred out of one hundred times before buying averse\nNow number five this one kind of cracks me up a fee out five hundred\nAbsolutely under no circumstances would either of us help anyone by if he got five hundred although\nIn my time when they give it a disclosure when they bury first came out before they started bringing reviews and before the contingency got rated as one of the worst cars ever made before that happened I did help a few people acquire them\nAnd that was right when they first came out around Thirteen I Want to say from there and the last several years if someone were to call and ask me to help them buy one I Would suggest that\nI Would not help them under any circumstances buy that car but would help them by any other car besides one of those and or another ...\nNow two thousand Eighteen Chevy sparks out on the list or anything I'd ever help anybody by I've never heard anyone by economy here's one that I think should be you know on the list and in the top three Hyundai accents of great little\nCart that is a good car agree again and if if you're following this so far so far they've only mentioned one car that is actually occurred either gear I Would recommend and believe it was a good car\nI'm not a monster a span of a Ford Fiesta\nI Would never have to anyone by a Ford Fiesta and again I wouldn't be helping them the reason why we mentioned on these different models that we have and help anyone by any of them is primarily because we care about people\nAnd and if we help to buy one of those cars would we really be helping you if you were in a circumstance where over just a small amount you can't get a better car\nI'm Still not going to help you buy one of those 'cause it's still not helping your\nNumber one which is a also I Believe a good cars a two thousand Eighteen to your real now over the weekend I had a phone call last week from a young lady that wanted my help getting a car\nAnd I explained to her that you're not buying a brand new key optimal and getting a two hundred and fifty dollar car payment now we could have went to one of these dealerships and bought one of these cars in that price point\nAnd I explained to her that I'm not going to help you buy one of those cars now this woman was in Ninety two years old\nIs sharpest attack understood everything was going on I was actually drove around with her on a test drive but here's what I Will tell people when you're looking at these Fifteen thousand dollar in under\nUsed cars new cars see what you can buy\nFor the same kind of money which thirty thousand miles on it and the Honda or a Toyota or a monster or something she bought a two thousand sixteen\nHyundai Sonata assay my concern with the cost for her was it had a\nTouch screen radio set up\nAnd by the time we were done she figured out exactly how to use all that but that car used which thirty thousand miles in a two thousand sixteen was less money than any of these eight cars new and\nAnd the far better choice than any of them to purchase and and again as a general rule as we talked about\nIn countless times every single transaction\nEvery single individual circumstance stands on its own\nThat whether you have equity or don't have equity whether you have great credit good credit or medium credit or bad credit whether you have a desire to lease her by whether you have certain thoughts in your mind that you've established that the key is each and every time it's different\nFor Gary and I after dealing with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of transactions and people over the last Thirty years\nWe have the ability to not only here listen understand and then guide you not to what's best for us ever 'cause what's best for us has only if you're happy\nHere here's the most important about gaining I helping you you have to understand we're not selling you anything we're helping you buy a car I got a phone call from a referral that had been in a vehicle for thirty five days in the terminal yanked\nThe car was taken back because they were unable to secure financing Gary obviously didn't help this young lady acquired a vehicle because when we help people choir vehicles that they\nGet into that so she decided that she wanted to still try to buy this car and then she called me and said she wanted to still she wanted to go on a different direction a friend of mine that works in a dealership sales this kind of car that she wants to look at so we go over last week and we look at the car\nAnd she fails to tell me something about the bank\nShe failed to mention to me that she makes a lot of money but doesn't have a really good proof of income she failed to mention to me that she's sixteen days out of a chapter Thirteen bankruptcy hoops and she wants to buy a forty five hours\nIn dollar car\nThat's not usually how the lenders helping to reestablish herself two months after a chapter Thirteen so\nWhen she provided them with what she felt was proof of income a letter from your account and as to how much you make is not an acceptable form of proof of income\nWhen you provide bank statements and the bank statements show the exact same amount going in as going out and not very good proof of income\nNow if she would have told me everything up front you know how I found out she just got out of a chapter Thirteen\nFrom your the gentleman that says she knew at the dealership that ran their credit\nExactly now once we submitted it\nIt they ran it all the way up to the head buyer for the credit department in this manufacture and the guy basically said not interested in helping this person\nNow I can tell when I called my friend to ask him a couple of things\nAfter speaking to her she really wasn't interested\nIn helping her either because one of the things that's really difficult when you're trying to help somebody is when they constantly say I know that I Know that\nI Know that and I find a look and said you know I don't know how to do what you do\nFor a living and I don't\nTry to make you understand that I think I Know you cannot get me to understand for one second that I'll ever believe you understand\nHow a cardio works now she mentioned that her first husband who passed away worked in a car dealership I can promise should this been with my wife for Twenty years\nKay she still doesn't understand one thing about the car business other than listening to what I have to say\nAnd not to point out the obvious but based on our backgrounds and based on our skill sets and based on the fact that we don't charge a penny to help someone and less they're thrilled\nIf we do church if he encouraged for four hundred dollar fee at the end of the transaction it's simply comes out of what we have saved you up to that point\nAnd then in order to make the deal they put another thousand dollars on top of what they thought I thought was already ridiculous [noise] but what I had to explain to the young lady was do you buy what you want\nFor\nSeventy one doubts or do you give up the following options get the following options and pay for the shocks and the twenty inch wheels and the off road stopping the hood scoop that doesn't really matter\nOr do you buy the limited for Seventy one dollars the longest part of the transaction it was ridiculous it took forty five minutes to run the people's credit\nBecause his computer kept locking up and wouldn't run the credit\nShall we run the credits computer locked up ... shut off the computer live back in one right now didn't run five times but he had to do it five times to get it to work and it is a pain because\nIt doesn't say many things to each time he had to input the information but when we were done she must have asked me five times before we done is it time for me to pay you yet is it time for me to pay you yet it's time for me to pay you yet\nWe are they're normally before you show up\nAnd we leave after you have the keys to the car now when it was all done she actually looked and said you know that blue color\nAfter looking at it I don't even know why I was thinking about white\nWell but the one thing for sure we're not only will we of course protect your best interests but if if something has to be white or it's truly important to you but it is white\nAnd there isn't a circumstance like Gary just describe where there's an alternative that would work\nOur objective is always to help you accomplish exactly what you want to accomplish the only time that that can become you know an issue is if if you don't understand you know how the math works and and so I my favorite\nPhrase that Dana says well so the figures don't lie but liars figure\nWell and and it just boils down to you know simple math is if you take twenty thousand dollars and you divide it by a five year term or sixteen months it's three hundred and thirty three dollars and thirty three and a third cents plus a fraction\nWithout any interest shirt ... and so\nWhen people\nToday are are looking for two hundred dollar payments and turned fifty dollar payments\nThat the average payment today in America the average car payment is five hundred and twenty three dollars per month and what's the average price\nWhile the average amount finances and excessive thirty five thousand dollars and so for for many people when they're thinking about their budget and they're thinking about what they want to do\nThe person that you should go to to help guide you through input even the best position to get the best vehicle\nFor your budget and pay for it the best way would be to pick up the phone call Gary Green his phone number six oh two\nFive to five one three seven zero or pick up the phone and call me Dana southern my phone number six so two six seven nine\nEight three to four\nYou may or may not know the best way for

profit that they're paying on the car and they'll pay me for that folks it's not what we do we are not brokers we our consumer advocates\nThe things that you get in the mail where you get a\nKey to win a car I almost want to call it propaganda it's not advertising they're designed to get you into the dealership and Dana always says it's not how you get there it's how you leave\nBarry five thousand dollars worth of negative equity into a smaller car to get better gas mileage\nAnd if you heard what he just said it's it's ludicrous but the key is to exactly what he said we we we can't control gas prices but the only difference in cost to the consumer\nIs how many miles they drive a year and and the small difference per gallon so obviously it does add up\nBut in general the the current market place is such that with Labor Day holiday just passing\nThe the Nineteen ... coming out of it is arguably a buyer's market and you know I'm\nLaughing when you were talking about the gas [noise]\nMy wife has a ram pickup truck\nThat good gas mileage and it's actually with a ... and needs to be automatic transmission I've never adjusted it's Eighteen miles to the gallon neo dominant shouldn't have very good driver and it goes down a little bit when I drive\nSo but the funny thing is when I fill my car it's Fifteen gallons of gas so it's somewhere between the two eighty or three fifty and I put premium in my car\nIt costs me forty five fifty bucks to fill my car up well I wasn't paying attention you know they took my wife's truck in the light was on so I pull up to the gas station and I'm looking and all of a sudden the truck was in full but the pump stopped so I guess at Seventy five dollars the\nPump shuts off because they won't run more than Seventy five dollars on a debit card but what I was laughing about was when I was helping the people by the tundra I spoke about earlier one of the options was thirty eight gallon fuel tank\nNow that's call at forty gallons and call it three dollars a gallon a hundred and twenty now and the woman doesn't drive a lot she could care less about the gas mileage but this is what people need to understand when you're buying a pickup truck and you even go to some of these smaller trucks they don't get great gas mileage\nI talked to people about this and I always joke when with a certain vehicle I said you know that vehicle so great it passes everything but a gas station\nGang now another important thing to look at when you're buying a car and your concern with your budget is open up that field door and see what it says on the inside of the door\nAnd if it says premium unleaded fuel required they usually see recommended or or only right so\nIf you Lisa car for three years in thirty six thousand miles and it says premium fuel required or recommend it [noise]\nAnd you want to use the middle grade you're probably not going to have a monsters problem but your car may not run as well\nHowever like myself when I bought my car my intentions were five years one hundred thousand miles\nPremium fuel recommend it actually says recommended and it says my horse power rating could change based on the field that I use [noise]\nSo I can use the other blends but I prefer to use the premium fuel but if you're buying a car and you want your car last use the fluids that or recommend follow the recommendations of the fuel the fuel\nFollow the fluid changes you know and and I'll tell you I was I was there the other day and they you know they told me I needed a new air filter\nAnd a kind of spoiled the whole experience because I had opened up the air filter the day before and I saw it it looked like\nAnd it kinda was a little on the pay inside and that's not that's not time yet so it's the next and I'm pretty good about changing my stuff\nBut you know everything in life is about relationships you know and it's all\nAbout not always what you know but who you know you know that warning I gave earlier today you know can I Will tell you this if if I continue to service my vehicle that dealership I Will never ever ever ever never take a serviceman or get\nA walk across the street and I will rent a car from enterprise they will pay for it which is it's part of my extended service contract and I will buy for the twenty dollars the insurance I don't drive a rental car maybe I'm Crazy maybe um\nIt's something that bugs me I don't drive a rental car or my insurance\nAnd I only giving my two cents in advice on what Gary just said um I Would highly recommend whether it does cost more or not that you indeed do purchase the insurance on a rental car in the event that you have to rent a car\nAnd there there's a few different reasons for that the most important reason is\nIt would not count against your insurance\nGod Forbid there is an accident and\nThe complications that can arise through your insurance company in the event that you do have an accident in the rental car can be very complicated so it's an individual decision you're allowed to self insure but if you assume that your insurance policy automatically covers it and everything's golden you may not be correct\nThat were just shoes assume yes now here's the big thing now this is what got me to buy it I was informed by the young lady when I was talking about because you are aware that in the event you have a collision and we cannot rent a car we can charge you for the last year news philosophy use now\nI ... to me it's it's it's it's just I I had a bad experience\nI rented a car I was in New York and I backed into a brick wall it was the first time I ever purchased the insurance and I don't know what made me thing to do it\nAnd my friend lives on a private street in Woodbury nice neighborhood only three houses on the street and the neighbor across the street had a concrete stone burn\nOn the side of it in the front of his house his house was elevated I backed out of my friends driveway in the pitch black my car had a backup camera in my car had beepers gain the car I rent it had neither [noise]\nThey'd have a warning K the warning no went off when you hit the war\nAnd I mean I heard boom and I got out and it looked like somebody took a basketball and shoved it into the rear bumper now was below the tail light so I didn't break the tail light and the funny part about it was my friend\nThat was house I was at restores cars\nSo he's a lap and his cage spring get by in the morning I'll pop the bumper of haven't fixed by five o'clock you bring it back we'll both back on never know anything\nWell I called enterprise and I said to the guy I hate that insurance that I bought what happens if Iraq the car well do you need another car no I brought the car back\nThey took a report I got a phone call the next day and I never heard another word\nWe understand not just about buying a car\nOkay we understand what's in your best interest in most aspects of the automotive industry will think about\nWhen when people in in order to try to save money want to buy that late model used car and they don't really take into consideration the loss of warranty house and they're going to face maintenance costs\nThe difference and value between a used car and a new car the different interest rates the difference in all these different variables it it's one of those things where again [noise]\nFor for most people do end up thinking oh I'm gonna buy a used car save money and and and so many sad cases they end up paying close to the same amount\nFor the car they end up paying off to the higher interest rate they end up financing the used car for six years\nAs opposed to\nYou know going shorter term because it's an older car and now the people that make those decisions and by those two and three year old cars by ... extended born tease on them\nPay what it costs to buy that car and then a few years down the road decide that perhaps they want something different\nThey're in such a bad position as compared to have they just simply released a brand new car for in most cases what would have been on a similar car just a three year term a lower payment than under warranty the whole time\nAnd had peace of mind\nAgain every situation stands on his tone but there's so many people that I think they try to calculate in their head or they or they think that\nHow they did the math is is how it should work and and sometimes of course they they do the calculations properly but in many cases they they simply don't do the calculations properly\nOf the final quarter of this year two thousand and Eighteen and first a trading day in October\nAnd boy we got off to a great start didn't wait the Dow has been really a rocking it and we're seeing a lot of these blue chip companies doing very well right now we did see also interest rates spiking\nAre hitting some high is that we haven't seen since two thousand and eleven on that ten year and some highs\nThat we haven't seen since two thousand and fourteen on the thirty year and what does that mean well that means for those adjustable rate mortgages out there the interest rates are going up for those longer term thirty year Fifteen and thirty year mortgages rates are going to be going up so again you if you're in the process of\nA refinancing or possibly purchasing a new home and you were contemplating should I be locking in my interest rate\nAnd you probably have to have a serious discussion with your loan professional to understand what's happening and to see what your options are because yes interest rates have gone up things are changing\nThat's affecting\nSome of these uh financial stocks out their bank stocks and financial stocks are doing well because of this they they will profit as interest rates go up\nAlso money will flow into the banks right as we start to see\nPossibly I should say the interest rates higher with CDs that haven't been for quite some time they've been depressed often times many people now can be looking at putting money into CDs if they're looking for a safe place for that money\nOr or for some type of short term dollars you might be getting some rate of return on your money right now\nAs we start just the interest rates rise we had strong economic data we saw a new a private sector jobs a blowout on private sector jobs\nTwo hundred and thirty thousand\nThis past month versus a hundred and eighty five thousand expected great news great news or all of these things are reasons why we're seeing again interest rates going up\nWe saw a Amazon this past week announcing they're going to be increasing their minimum wage for their employees up to Fifteen dollars\nA for us employees whether they're part time or full time employees just as a minimum wage for the company Amazon of course this is a each company has their own rules that they can set when it comes to minimum wage as long as they comply with\nLocal or state and federal laws are but in this case Amazon is taking the step to increase it above and beyond what are those averages are in a you know if we think about it that it was Bernie Sanders who is calling Amazon out\nA stating that they were paying well below what they should be for their employees so I don't know what what the reason was why they decided to do that the stock took a little bit of a hit because of it why well obviously payroll and most companies just one of the largest internal expenses\nWhich means that does take away from profit but\nYou know in this economy today we've got a very very low unemployment and very high employment right now and we're basically looking for a good employees in our companies and so in order to keep these people\nAre you may have to pay a little bit more and maybe that's what Amazon is thinking and maybe there are a little ahead of the curve on this but it's gonna be interesting to see what\nOther companies will do as we move forward or will other corporations follow suit alright folks I Do want to take care of a couple of housekeeping things as I Do each and every week here on the word on wealth as always a check out our website grand\nCanyon planning each week

page\nAnd we look forward to catching on the other side of this break stay right here with us folks this is the word on wealth and I'm John ...\n\n\nMichael ... says we can prosper in a state of crisis expressing your feelings is one thing but talking to someone else\nIs something else entirely and I don't think we're talking to each other\nA very successfully as Americans where do we go from here\nBecause I don't think anybody believes that we can continue with his hair racist and it'll be good for the country\n... Michael ... show we days it was on intelligence on nine sixty the Patriot\nAre the boys aren't married yet and don't have kids they're girl is married and she has two kids All right so we say that if the girl is deceased her share we'll go to her children are right and then typically with the boys we would say well off one of them as deceased the share we'll go\nEqually to this had his his surviving siblings right and the other two beneficiaries right but in this case we might say well if he has children not to have his share go to his children to 'cause we're thinking way in the future right we're not planning ahead mhm even though maybe he's never going to have children but it wouldn't matter because if he doesn't have children or go to his other two siblings right\nSo we might that's maybe what we want to do and we would do the same thing for the other brother now\nSome sometimes the question is well um well the spouses are part of the families want to leave something for the spouses well then we would need to purposely do that and we would want to list them right and that that's something you could do or you could say look I'm not leaving anything any grandchildren I don't care it just goes to my three children and if one of them is to see the survivors of the three and so on and then if\nIf my three children are deceased then I Want it to go equally to whoever my grandchildren are at that point right but you do something like ... or you could say look\nMy passing I Want everything to go to the society of St Vincent de Paul ... right and if by chance of society of St Vincent DePaul has not been in existence then I Want my share to go to the wounded warrior foundation right right so you can do something like that and you can mix it you can say look\nUpon my passing 'em my state goes to my three children equally and then if one of my children is deceased fifty percent of their share we'll go to this charity and fifty percent goes to their children you know what I mean right I I probably wouldn't advocate that but you could so there's really no limit here but we want to carry it out\nWe want to at least to go to the beneficiaries children and then to wrap it around to the beneficiaries now sometimes we might have other family members of the question is if you don't have kids who do I leave your to do you leave your state too sometimes could be your siblings right could be your nieces and nephews or could be a really good friends could be a charity could be the church you go to\nI mean there's the idea is to think about this while I don't care who gets my stuff I'll be that I don't care where it goes okay but maybe there is a relatively good use it or maybe there's a charity that's really impacted your life or maybe your church means a lot to you or you know\nI think she Jonathan often times to uh we find that it may change over time in other words if you're married and you have a spouse and you create some type of an estate planning some type of uh beneficiary designation if maybe you don't have children you're thinking about maybe charities or maybe\nFriends or family or people that have touched you in a certain way throughout your lifetime that are important to you that have made an impact on you\n[noise] um but then maybe something happens to your spouse where they have an issue whether it's Alzheimer's or whether it's cancer or whatever the illness maybe in all of a sudden you see a new experience that type of a situation and now all of a sudden\nYou feel compelled to maybe make a change or to maybe have a charity that you've ultimately seeing\nThat would be in that in bats that training fall and it's important and and those types of gifts I mean\nIt was really this past couple of weeks Jonathan we've had a number of clients that have been affected deeply by Alzheimer's where a spouse\nHas had Alzheimer's in a couple of ... instances of their spouse finally had um passed on but uh others are still dealing with this and it's getting to a point to where it gets worse and so as an example Jonathan if we think about this if you've got to\nA spouse right now that you're I'm dealing with who has a an issue such as Alzheimer's\nIt is critical Jonathan that you have documents in place I Would imagine so that you could ... business whether it's health decisions in financial decisions in making sure that there's a there's a plan in place in the event of a well this is the worst I so\nThis is the worry this is why you do stay planning documents that this is the worst case scenario right because of vets discuss what happens if you don't have to stay planning documents in the situation if you don't have estate planning documents in this situation you may or may not be able to do anything on your spouse's behalf and you may be forced to go to court and become a conservative\nYeah not not a good position of being shot that we need to talk about this and another segment coming

nine\nNine one ten fifty five I look forward to meeting with you I'm John Dankosky reminding you don't run out of money before you run out of time now back to the show [noise]\n\nAll right John to rescue the word on wealth as always with you here for the full hour today we're talking some\nFinancial talk stay planning talk tax [noise] and I were going to be bringing a on\nA down ... Potter and highs are we going to be talking\nAbout a couple of uh issues facing a people out there with businesses but also a this is an issue that I find happens often\nIs um maybe you own a piece of real estate\nAnd you want to get that piece of property to a family member and you're wondering what's the best way for me to do this in the most tax efficient way to where I can take advantage of either attacks gainer attacks loss or whatever it might be a and then also have it be beneficial to the next in line that I'm transferring it to\nAnd this is a real challenge because I refuse onto it irises wise to these things someone to bring on a Darren Darren how you doing I'm doing great of course that Darren segue Richard cigarettes cheap Potter and high sort of course down to a CPA we have them on the show is a regular and we appreciate and being here as always\nAnd we're going to talk a little bit about this idea Darren of I own a piece of property\nOr whether I've had it for a short period of time a long period of time that doesn't matter but what really does matter is is what the true value of that property because if I'm going to transfer that property to a loved one whether it's one of my children or a parent or brother or sister or whoever\nBut I'm going to give it to them or sell it to them at what maybe we would consider to be at discount right is that the right word right now you lesson appraised value right\nAnd and so what is the let's talk about the idea that OK I on the property I don't need it anymore and I need my parents need a place to live so I'm just gonna it's two hundred thousand but I'm going to sell to my parents for one fifty how's that sound\nNow I pay two hundred and four it can take a fifty thousand dollar loss and on my taxes because of that\nNature be nice but uh they're not on my mood and now you're not going to be able to do that and\nReally if you think about it you know real estate transactions that very well documented bright right but there are a couple of you know I don't know ... parts of uh of any real estate transactions number one cause space will sometimes becomes an issue mhm and the IRS understands these things I'm ... so\nIf you bought it for you know will tell you to buy for one fifty and you put fifty thousand dollars of improvements on that right\nWell you you can fudge the numbers are up for a number down and then sold at a at a lesser amount on the ... when the appraised value because of his or related party you can play games with a cat iris throws those games what would you say you can't so a property for last related part it\nGot it except\nIf you can prove that you're selling it for market value\nThen you've got ... you can take the loss All right and so we've we've had different situations over the last even ten years sure I'm sure you may have had a significant loss and you are selling the property to a family member but you bought it for six hundred thousand dollars and you're selling it to him for five hundred thousand dollars\nBecause after your market value if you've ... you've got to be able to prove that right even if it is to mom or dad and they're buying it for market value that that doesn't preclude you for taking walks but you know the burden of proof is going to be on the individual to prove that you're not so you're the discount\nRight and one of the things that I and I am a real estate broker but I don't um I don't know that you know I represent clients in real estate transactions they aren't\nUm but I Would say this is that whenever a real estate transaction occurs most people\nA sign their name a bunch of ... and the transaction ready to go to the quote to closing and they have all the papers and there's a you know half a century inch thick of papers\nThat you go through when you sign your name and you sign your name and the loan documents and the cell documents and that the recording documents in this document and the escrow fees that are that goes on and on all the documents that you're signing\nOne of those documents that you usually sign is called an affidavit property value or up after David a real value I think it is and you basically stating this is what the property it the value of it\nThat I'm buying it for so there's a way the county has records right they know right value if they want to know what the new property so what the property so for the new value they want to know um you know anytime why do we have to have permits when we\nUm you know try to do any changes to our homes well two reasons one of safety reasons right they want to commend the spec make sure you're doing anything correctly you're not going to no one's going to get hurt or killed on the property because you did something stupid\nOr but too is is if you put a new bathroom in or if you put an addition on your house guest what your property taxes are going up folks right because the value of the property went up there is going to be a up you're going to pay for that\nAnd so there's this affidavit of real property that you execute as well and that's basically you're you're now that's going to be recorded there's a lot of things that go into a sale but if you do a quick to slide under that under the you know kind of door sale to mom or dad or to sister brother son or daughter\nSometimes a lot of these pieces don't properly get done right and you don't necessarily have a clear title either in many cases people do what's called the quick claim deed\nA and oftentimes a quick claim deeds basically it not there could be loans on the property that could be um clouds on the title but I'm quick claiming it to you I don't have the problem anymore now you take you inherit the problem right so you might get a property for less than what you perceive the true market value is but there could be some other headaches that come with that so\nUsually it makes sense for you to use the title company even in a situation when it's a closely related party they are selling it to it's a lot cleaner yeah it's kinda like\nBuying a used car right and you use curry Europe there you're buying and they also like you know what I'm saying and you've got to be careful enough\nYeah so again so when we come to this point of okay I sold it for less than they are to a related\nParty now all of a sudden I Can't take that deduction I Can't take a while right\nYou still have to report it on your tax returns or you're going to show with the title company though though issue a a ten Ninety nine a sort of government knows what you sold it for ... if you don't report anything you've got a problem because on the higher ups doesn't understand what the basis wants to begin with right\nBut the problem is you can't record again so again in that situation your tax return actually shows\nTwo hundred thousand dollars of cost sold it for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a chosen fifty thousand dollar loss\nBut you gotta make sure that you identify as a reward later party seal so to last us not you know through to return\nRight and now and the other side of the coin down you've got the person who bought it\nAnd now the person who bought it for fifty thousand dollars say less than what the market value as\nA ... immediately they've got a fifty thousand dollar appreciable gain there\nAnd if they're going to be using it for a personal residents I guess there's a benefit versus if they're going to be using it for an investment property there could be some potential additional tax obligations that the buyer may have in the future as well because it costs basis so low is that correct that's correct so again folks\nBefore you do something like this just like anything when you have a financial transaction make sure you talk to a professional you should probably be talking to your CPA about this you should be talking to your\nReal estate professional or maybe a title company as I mentioned how to transfer this property\nAnd there are some legal issues when it comes to this is well you may want to touch base with a a a real estate attorney as well just to make sure that your idea maybe sounded maybe find it may be perfectly fine but just to understand all of the ramifications of what you're trying to accomplish and make sure that you're not going to have any surprises\nYou know a year from now two years from now three years from now if the IRS comes knocking on your door because they're looking at a tax return from three years ago\nA and they're saying well wait a minute you owe us you know Seventeen thousand dollar share\nWhatever the number is ... and you can also have some ... some challenges there might be some better ways of doing it from an estate planning same point yes rather than selling it or gifting it over the parents are vastly right or a lot of issues to look at but just be careful\nYeah just be careful but you're right there are some ways to do it to a state planning as well ah Darren I'm just real quickly got a short period of time left in the segment any other thoughts on maybe a business owner is out there because this is a big one business owners have some\nTo help that we can bring to the table and from their perspective I Would think that people want to know just not just what I Know but how much I care and the fact that I really want to hear\nWhat they're all about and I can't build a really we can build a plan together and be successful in retirement unless we both ask those deep question and I'll say there should be no question that you don't feel comfortable asking your advisor\nWhen it comes to your hard earned money mhm keep going keep going so so fill us\nWe're talking about these these different types of questions I'll call and good question versus bad question but really it's the surface level questions\nVersus something that goes a little bit deeper when somebody asks you for example why do you do this why do you ... how long have you been doing this and why do you do this what sorority tell them\nOh gosh yeah when I go into my why I think that people really see how genuine I Am about what I Do and how much it matters and what gets me up in the morning because my why\nReally came when when my mom became an instant widower fifty nine years old my dad died instantly in a car accident\nAnd overnight she lost the love of her life I lost my dad and\nShe was also a stay at home mom and she lost her paycheck\nAnd you know wonderful wonderful wonderful parents are so blessed\nShe I was taking a hiatus from from the fight from what I was doing raising the kid she didn't want to burden me even though I had helped my dad's set up his retirement plans ... saving for retirement right so she tried to do it alone with other advisors and while\nShe was just devastated everybody was trying to help her um invest\nWhat money she had\nTalking about performance performance performance but nobody was helping build up a plan and figuring out what she needed it when I sat down with her and realized my goodness I understand why my mom devastated she has no idea how to how to get a paycheck\nFrom all of this I had an epiphany and I realize that as people transitioned into retirement and once they retired just like my mom for all intents and purposes as she was retired\nIt's a whole new set of rules and she doesn't need to hear about the pretty products and the performance and the performance in the performance and how much is going to gross you need to know about how she's going to be able to get a paycheck from that grow it safely get income from that um make sure\nThat principle is pretty safe and I started my career I realize that there was this niche and I was thank goodness I had this if his knee I was able to help my mother get through the years that she has sushi live sixteen years past my dad ...\nShe could because we built a clean we built a retirement plan and\nI feel blessed that I was able to have that epiphany and realize that there's different rules we had to look at things differently and we had ... and we had a structure her plan differently so\nI feel compelled to tell the rest of the world no it's not just about performance when you retire it's about building this plan it's about getting your dreams on paper and making sure we have a plan that supports it\nAnd when people ask me that question they see how invested I and in it and and how I Want to give back because I watch my mom live through it you know two\nThousand when the market went down and she still had her paycheck coming in and she was as comfortable as she could be and all the other things that that went on with her life and I take pride that I was able to help her and I want to do the same I Want to give\nThat back so when I start answering that question I Know I'm ... and on\nBut people get to see what's really behind me and then you know what at the end of the day it's not how much I Know but it's how much I care and why I Do what I Do so so that person coming in and asking that question they get it that low dig deep\nFind out what that advises about not just the plaques that we have and the pretty pictures we might have a family around but what is the heart say why do they do it why do they want to help you really important question\nIt it really is and it does show sill is not only the passion you have for this and why it also illustrates the importance of getting this planning die in the first place can you talk about the difference between a conversation with a client to start planning versus\nReacting to an emergency that has happened and they realize they need some help I mean that's that's kind of how you started off with your family a little bit\nOh absolutely I realize yeah that that's exactly what it was I realized that we had a\nWe had to have a plan and pays place big so each month when one wouldn't be reacting to oh how do I do this how do I do that oh my gosh the market's down now what do I do right so if I can get anything or across to anybody listen as you transition enjoyed time and it's an entirely\nDifferent set of rules it's not just about growing your money like it is when you have that paycheck and you have time on your side\nRules change so stop\nYeah and realize that all the\nPlanning is different and really you do not go into retirement if all you\nHave is an amount of money that you feel comfortable with you've got to have\nA structure plan and that's what I learned that night that I helped my mom I can remember like it was yesterday the first thing we did was go through what I Do with people every day whether they think they know you know whether they think they're all set or not go through what paint that picture of what retirement looks like\nThen they make sure that they have an income plan because I'm going to tell you when the paycheck goes away if you don't have\nReliable inflation protected income in retirement you really don't have a retirement plan so you've got to think that through have the plan B proactive not reactive and we'd that incomes then you've got to have an investment plan that supports that some of the income you're going to need right now\nYou're going to invest that relatively safely because we don't know what the market's going to do from day to day I don't know right now because you know where's the market in any given moment oh yeah right everywhere and and then as time goes on and we're going to invest a little bit differently to get\nInflation adjusted income so we're going to have a we've got to think that process through the investment strategies have to support your income when you're inflation grow you also have to have a tax strategy you get out of\nThe greatest income when you could have the greatest investments I see it all the time with the market is doing as well as it's done lately oh I made twelve percent last year well\nSorry you really didn't make twelve percent because the government made half of that because we're going to give it back in taxes so you've got to have a tax strategy and before we even think about what we're going to you know how we're gonna\nRetire when we're going to retire we should have\nThe sense attack strategy what about if there's a health care crisis where\nIs that money going to come from we don't want to be reactive we want to be proactive and then my mom's case\nMy mom had to believe it or not there was a car accident sixteen years later after the actors in the car with my dad she wasn't she lived nine months of the day of the car accident\nAnd she needed even though I I never in my wildest dreams thought that I Would have to put my mom and a nursing home but she spent some time in a nursing home because you had a\nA brain injury they wouldn't allow us to bring her home so we had done health care planning and the only thing we could do is because we've done the right planning and it was important from my mom\nTo be independent and not have us pay for it\nBecause we've done the right planning we were able to give her dignity in the type of nursing home that we were able to put her\nIn so we want you need to think through what would happen if there's an emergency what's my plan where with my money come from ... for a health care crisis the need for custodial care\nYou need an estate planning people they just stay plans will look if I'm gone I don't care if the government gets this or other people get my money my kids we've taken care of them along the way in a state plan is so much more than that\nYou need powers of attorney while you're alive ... if you're not able to act on your own behalf so that your spouse can do things with your retirement accounts or if this health care decisions that need to be made for you and you're not able to make ...\nYou need those in place and you know what quite frankly [laughter] yeah the first and foremost after working years and years and years to accumulate what you've accumulated I Know you love your kids\nBut you know if he if you get to enjoy that and bunker last paycheck that great but most people don't and at the end of the day if there's a way to make sure you set things up properly\nSo that your loved ones your children your church is your charities get what you want instead of the government without without causing any habit to you why wouldn't we want to do that with the state plan and\nThose are all the things that we really really really have to stop and build into a plan and then live our life and without really knowing what I mean\nThat's what I realize that night was my moment you said I don't know what to do everybody's telling me how much I'm going to make but I don't even know how to pay the bills I don't even know what the\nBills are that was the label that that went off on my head and you know sometimes I mean really intelligent people worked harder than they've saved tired and they've done so well on the accumulation phase but they don't necessarily know what they don't know they don't know how much risk taking they don't know how much they need for retirement\nMaybe have more risk than you thought and this tomorrow the market doesn't do what we expected it to do you're going to have less income you're gonna have to sell off holdings that you're never going to get back in retirement\nWe'll show you that in black and white but the first step is let's ask good questions to understand\nWhat you're trying to accomplish\nYou ask the questions to understand if you even want me begin to help you build that plant and solve that and so the retire fit analysis will do that for you if you've worked hard and you're close to retirement or you're in retirement you've done the heavy lifting you saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for retirement\nPick up the phone calls for retire\nFit analysis the number to do that is six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six you\nGot to be one of the first ten calls to call us who saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for retirement\nThere is no obligation absolutely not there is no cost to this\nBut let's just have a great discovery conversation to see if it makes sense to help you with your issues if there are any\nNumber one more time six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six she reached Phyllis ... and the team that P. S. P. N. associates I'm generally jak alongside we've been talking about the right questions\nThat you should be asking as you were going to their retirement planning process and fill us our our main point has then we want to go beneath the surface of a question do you get a better understanding of the advisor we're working with their background\nAnd from the advisors perspective they need to know what we're all about so they can help them figure out how to accomplish their goals but this isn't to say the surface level questions shouldn't be asked to I mean it it ... you need to ask questions such as what the cost of these investments what are the fees we need to ask those questions right\nAbsolutely\nAbsolutely first is there a connection is is some depth and substance to this person that you're potentially thinking about getting financially naked with or maybe working with but then yeah absolutely\nThey can be great talkers they can have great connections but if they're not forthcoming and trends parents and they don't want to education to lay everything else so that you're the c._e._o. of your money there's something wrong with that too so you\nAbsolutely need to to ask those surface questions if you will\nOkay just just like you would not go out and buy a car and not ask the sales person how much the car costs [laughter] and we laugh all you do that\nBut I Can't tell you how many times people have a financial instrument and they really don't understand how much\nIt's costing them and and I'm going to say this to you I really think that it's incumbent upon the right financial professionals to volunteer that to you mhm what you're going to be putting into that investment what is going to be costing you and lay it out\nFor you rather than you having to ask but sometimes maybe maybe like me can you\nTell I get passionate about things you know\nI was so excited about talking about other things that I may not get to that point knowing that I Will you know eventually so you want to stop\nIf it hasn't been answered and get an explanation of that because different investments\nHave different costs associated with them so I think we should bring down a couple of days\nYeah yeah well yeah because I think a lot of that so we we understand there might be costs are fees but we don't really know where they are how to find them\nYeah so this is a good rule of thumb no matter how you invest you're going to incur costs if you use an advisor there's going to be costs associated with that\nDefinitely some way shape or form even if you use what we call the robo advisers this costs associated with that so yeah we want to use should be breaking down and knowing those costs so that you can evaluate\nAs an educated investor make a well informed decision whether you're getting enough bang for your buck ... and sometimes you know I'm never\nThe cheapest on the street but\nI Believe that we bring so much value to the table that it's not just about ... right I Will\nTell you this we really believe that\nWhether we getting paid a commission and I'm going to elaborate on that is the second word technically you don't write a check for or\nWhether you write a check for some advice for some management we believe that we should lay that out for you so that you get to choose am I getting the bang for my book that I deserve\nAnd that's really a huge
