connects olive ourselves begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we being

with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that of each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or\nNot whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus there's going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies for those that may not know Dr bank is he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health\nHe's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThey are it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress\nOn the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects their body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension and\nYour muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in there in the upper back in ... right\nAnd the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel that most of the arteries oh that guy ended up and the mothers the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and\nHow many people do you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their\nHow many ... at issue it\nHas to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah and it does do here but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't a diet you know and to us from the bones themself\nThe body will ... will up its orbit back from the bones have been either\nThat's right but I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian\nFood they're irradiated hum the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they\nBuy the health food store drug writer right but\nThese things don't absorbing the\nBody that's for a couple of reasons\nOne when you take a let's say an antacid that had the ... minute like Tom's first of all calcium absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom\nIsn't antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that\nPowder and what happened to put it in hot water and you mix it up and drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that's a problem with\nWell yeah because when calcium and magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing them take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications sleeping pills but the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all the things\nMy comment formula does absorbed in credit when the body the thing is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people that Dr Frank I Can't believe a thirty minute to counteract the pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time an error I mean this is really amazing\nIt's one eight hundred eighty two three eight eight\nFive seven well if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael make us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but\nYou know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm going to have a water main break in or you have a real notice all things considered little trips a little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late [laughter]\nDoctor because you had mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium any of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles and they need him actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take the comments formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I ... a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a desk and my back in ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or even even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't it amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady was suffering from fibromyalgia\nWhere she was having pain in just about every join her body being hernia could be Internet could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I ... for the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright shared a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming\nAnd I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough but she was the one who took a week of uh the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends so that is amazing and when I use it with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us\nBefore their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles in real relax shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact on the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication is that many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium and use them in the system is very drugs that are training the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish and in many of them is also blocking\nFurther absorption does and it's it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr

Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin

in the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying if it's a multifaceted problem where one for not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ...\nVitamin D the trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength and the eating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly it surprises me because in medical school\nWe learned that hydrogen view as necessary for the phone we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right hand for the first twenty some years I practice I never prescribe item in the I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands\nOf the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary [laughter] it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that shouldn't be in the body and it's not there\nAnd back again we do and yet we can't seem to get a handle on pain relief ... what's going on\nThe last time I was here it was estimated that forty three million Americans are dealing with pain in their body just astounding now that number has doubled to an estimated eighty six million American adults and that's why I'm here today I really want to talk to you about this epidemic\nWell what kind of pain are we talking about here all the ISIS rheumatoid

don't hear in the valley the sun we have all these beautiful hiking trails around in some can get pretty rocky and steep the other day I was watching some kids climb up on a tall rock and had a steep face\nAnd it got up to the top they weren't even worried about falling they had no thought of how they were going to get down there was just no apparent concern for potential bodily harm\nBecause I watched him it dawned on me how risking their bodily health\nBecause they were young they had no concern\nAnd it's very similar to risky money in retirement they both have consequences for example when we're young we have no problem going up those hills Iraq's slipping and sliding then coming back down as little thoughts of danger consequences\nAnd along the way getting some bumps and bruises it's just easier to heal up from it when you're young\nOnce you get older though\nWe may still go hiking but it's probably with a bit more caution\nThe reason for this as simple as we get older the ability for our bodies to absorb physical punishment it's decreased and the time it takes to recover his increased\nIf you think about it the same is true for our money when we're young we can absorb the bombs or bruises you can absorb the huge losses any retirement money you know because of the time period available to recover was much longer however when you're in retirement or close to retirement\nThere's little to no time to recover from those losses\nThe no marketing strategies I work with allow you to see the beauty without the danger you can still get to participate in the fun
