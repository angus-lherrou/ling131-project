constitution but also about Winston Churchill in Shakespeare and all of our conversations which began in twenty Thirteen about Homer\nAnd it brought us to the constitution itself today are all founded cue for Hillsdale dot com doctor on Good Friday morning to you thank you for joining me\nGood to you too All right we're back because of current events I have to go backwards in our constitution series\nTo article one section three the United States Senate and the reason I'm doing that is\nNot surprisingly as the Republicans seem intent upon keeping and indeed expanding their Senate majority we've seen online and on air arguments of the Senate is non representative and must be changed that it's wrong for North Dakota have two senators et cetera so I thought [noise]\nLarry aren't as the founders key author one of his great books on the ... and what they intended and we're going to talk about the Senate and what it is supposed to do this morning\nAn article one section three says the center of the United states shall be composed of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature there are for six years in each hunter show have one vote now we're choosing part has been changed by the seventeenth and limit which now reads\nThe Senate or the United states should be comprised of two senators from each state\nElected by the people there um for six years in each ... one boat that was ratified in Nineteen Thirteen\nSo our original document was updated in Nineteen Thirteen wrongly are rightly so we kept Matt Larry aren't we kept that two senators would you explain the theory and practice their up\n[noise] ah well the the ... the original is slightly different from the current uh they both have the same central principal the original was a compromise in the ... the biggest compromise in the ... made the constitution come together\nAnd ah the compromise was shells there'd be two chambers both representing just a population of the United states or shall there'd be two chambers one of them representing the state\nAnd that compromise was necessary to get the constitution through\nAnd in my opinion also good and I will tell you that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton who were the initial enemies of the compromise\nThey came around to that way of thinking to investors convention produced a consensus on most of the big things\nAnd why well ah the the thing is they were looking out already upon a continent and they didn't know how bad was yet they they didn't find that out for almost Twenty years\nUh actually near the almost Twenty years Lewis and Clark Lewis and Clark right so somebody came back you know his big day when Lewis and Clark outback\nTell me about it so it's a gunshot [laughter] what what is this thing you know\nAnd that but they were keenly interested in the thing right so George Washington's army was called the continental army and then the question is and they also very much believed in this in the art art argument some of the federalist papers more than the anti federalist but it's in both sets of papers in various places\nThe argument is you're going to have to have a big country and you're gonna have to have a big country for a lot of reasons but one of them that's obvious and simple is national defense\nAnd we don't want to build another year up here we don't want you know all that you know ... borders neighbors wars\nConstant intrigue and so they were interested in extending the fear of the United states and the deeper reasons or in federal it's nine and a there about\nHow you can get better divisions of power and ultimately more excellence in government by having to watch here so they are they're going to be a big country now the question is how do you represented\nAnd distinct the Senate is like\nA massive fact that happen in the same summer is riding constitution in the northwest ordinance they devised a method for the country to grow and the method is not that to the new territory will ever be treated as a colony it would not\nIt would be treated as a territory soon to become a state and then there's one thing that's always a consensus in the ... in in the founding era and then the constitutional convention and that is most things done by government will be done locally as close to the people as possible\nSo now at the national level you've got to represent\nThe continent and and you know huge diverse changes in territory and geography and therefore the way people live and so you want to represent that too and you want to represent the whole of it because the challenge is to unite a great empire of liberty\nSo the Senate is for balancing its for protection of local and it's for uniting the country section by section into a whole\nTo stretch out of many disparate parts one quilt a liberty now Larry on our framers were often on horseback traveling great distances not just during the revolutionary war but before and after and back and forth to the Annapolis can mentioned in the Philadelphia can mentioned this day ratifying you mentioned\nAnd they were acquainted with the diversity of this great country and this is not merely knowing it's partially\nA slave owning interests versus the abolition of interest is not merely that they also recognize that there were looking to states like New York in agrarian states like Georgia and small states like ride Rhode Island and ... states like Virginia which at the time of this\nWas literally unlimited I Believe a because then we got ... all the way extending as far as I could go show what part do that recognition of ... of the deep diversity of America play in the coddling together of the Senate\n[noise] yeah well they they would not yeah they did the the word diversity a curse in the federalist papers good point [noise] um so yeah and just remember people today people have real attachment to\nThe place where they were born and grew up in the Michigan you lived there all the unbelievable inches that used to even\nMichigan they're attached to\nYeah yeah but and cause you know first of all what choice if he got he got to go to Ohio [laughter] so it's a\nIt's a a it's a ... yeah you you know you like the football team from your state and you like the baseball team and all that right and that's just a reflection of something larger you\nKnow yes yes he grow up\nIn California if you go up in urban California you know where I Lived a long time and he lived a long time then you know God help you it's it's in some ways very similar to growing up in urban Boston but in other ways really different\nCompletely a hundred percent different because of the freeways and the beach because of the music and the restaurants because of the fact that you have to drive these vast distances as opposed to Boston getting on the MTA the green line to go down three stops\nThat's right yeah so in LA you know nothing is more than Seventy miles apart\n[laughter] make across the ocean [laughter]\nYou know and that's just and see just remember we we we forget these days right but we have the bodies and they have to be somewhere and it matters what their surroundings are like and so the idea that you would eliminate that uh would be ultimately to eliminate consent of the government\nSo I Want to go back to you you said that Hamilton in Madison were originally opposed to the Senate barriers abroad the argument that the Senate reflects the slave holding interest that is profoundly wrong but it is everywhere\nYeah that that uh the slave holding interest influence the debate but it did not drive the debate\nAnd and the way to understand that is a you know there was an assumption and it was very widespread that slavery was going to pass away and that it had\nThat uh that uh that are that are influenced by the federal government and so\nThat that wasn't possible when the Senate was chosen but the state legislatures that I Would go back to that although I think there's little prospect of it because I think that would be a really good uh [noise] um\nYeah we're not going to I Would ah we're not going to reopen the seventeenth amendment as a practical matter I'm against the conventional estates of the matter as well but when we come back we're going to continue to talk about the glory of the Senate and this current eruption of attacks upon it as an

switches deliberate wherever you\nWere talking about the Senate today and in the last segment Dr ... I made the statement that the Senate but the people must rule eventually\nTo which the left his critics like this fellow from GQ would respond but the Senate prevents the majority from rolling so I'd like to expand on on how in fact the majority will work its will as it did in the thirties it just takes some time\nThat trade well so you know obviously if there's if there's a public opinion\nSo told Madison\nMany in there to supply and places in the federalist where Madison's a describes what will be achieved by the constitution and in the fifty first federalist forty ninth I Can't remember now sorry he says I'm\nA a\nIt is the reason alone of the people that should be placed in control of the government their passions should be controlled by it\nNow how do you achieve that well you spread authority across the country that is what the Senate does\nBut then the second thing is even bigger than that and this thing just the whole structure of the constitution if he were the argument to get rid of the Senate is an argument to get rid of the whole constitution\nBecause the house has represented from districts every two years and the Senate is elected for six years from states\nAnd the president is elected nationally every four years and then a lot of the power is is lodged in the state and they have lots of different systems right\nAnd that means to get a big dramatic thing done you have to ... you have to ask the people their opinion over a series of elections\nAnd isn't it it's just you just gave a game away though um it's an attack on the constitution right not really an attack on the Senate it's an attack on the constitutionality\nMole thing ... and ... to the end of what that's what we really got to get to wire people attacking the Senate in order to attack the constitution what is the motive Larry on what is their objective\nWhile the kid the attack on the competition started\nWith the rise what live you know they've been several there was one one slavery became a big deal people decided they loved it under the influence by the way of a bunch of ... ideas of the evolution foreign to the founding of America [noise] they they didn't they were attacking constitution\nAre supporting it you know abolitionists would attack the cops it does it protect slavery a southerners wanted more Confederate white more slavery would attack it because it doesn't give us enough protection for our slaves in the territories\nRight so these things are not new but the current one starts in the Eighteen eighties nineties Woodrow Wilson is a big author and what he says is this regime of checks and balances\nIt's a it's a like Newton like his picture of the universe but now we have Darwin and we know that government is living organism and has to change right so the the progressive movement is very impatient\nWith this because the effect and people should understand is right the effect of the constitution is to make public opinion\nPowerful and sustained way in the end even today with the government has its Mitt and more than half of the economy right even today it does matter so very much what the people think\nAnd to sustain that and get that that's what the constitution does but their idea that progressive Joe Wilson for example what he thinks is\nExperts people who know people who can apply science to public policy should become much more influential in the government\nAnd that's what gives rise to this fourth branch of government which now makes most of our laws in forces them and and educate them in their independent the hundred and fifty or so independent agencies\nThat's that's where all that came from and it is by the way a change in the nature of sovereignty\nBecause sovereignty came in the in the American revolution according to the nature of the individual than you're born a person you're not on a horse or a dog\nAnd so you have to be by your nature govern only with your consent the new way as we have power over nature now and if we use science and knowledge\nMind and said wow okay maybe there's some stylistic things that I didn't love about this guy but I sure a lot of the results I Love is the economy I Love are stronger borders I Love the dismantling of the regulatory state\nI Love the tax cuts I Love it there there's ...

this quickly gotta move Bradley let us stipulate you love you and I love to us so far so good truck yes\nI Love you so much that I started to care about the Cleveland Browns that's how much I Love you I offer that is tough line because my friend than yours you has never been as misguided as he is about first man\nThis is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement there is I Want to describe a nonexistent creature sunny a nonexistent creatures like sasquatch or a Jeb Bush supporter is nonexistent the person who has seen first man actually seen it and believes that is anti American take a floor\nYeah absolutely I mean look at it as a uh there there is a controversy that has been picked up a about first man and it is largely the fault of the star we have to ... to do with your uh you know at a conference at the Venice film festival ... that something really\nSo is that he's got a dumb thing we can all agree that this was a dumb thing he said that uh Neil Armstrong thought of themselves\nNot as an American hero but at the world hero now what kind of couching it in in his own experience at the Canadian Canadians of course don't have any heroes\nSo they have to the world's heroes I Do I understand I understand what he was doing and look it was it was a mistake\nAnd instead of putting out the fire the the the director he didn't doubled down exactly but you said at truth thing which is that are within the context of the story of the actual planting the flat I mean again what we're talking about here is the plant but if I leave string of the pole\nIn the moon rock they do not show that that had a second clip of the moon journey okay\nUm but within the context of the film it makes perfect sense why they wouldn't do that or when they get to the moon\nThe film switches to kind of a more subjective experience that kind of puts you in at a Brian ... uh Neil Armstrong and\nAnd it is it is designed that way and it works I mean look you see you see the flag on the moon everyone is talking about how the flag it's been a race from this movie insane new uh everyone everyone who talks about how this movie downsized American achievement ours or suggest that it's not about the face races insane\nEveryone who talked about how this is not\nA an event that had fired the rest of the world to follow American achievement in American greatness is is just wrong I mean there's ... after\nThe moon landings takes place there's literally a montage\nOf people talking about how great America is there's a French woman says the French we could never do it but America can do it I only believe in them so I mean it's like it is ... ... anyone who actually see that movie I don't know anyone who actually goes to see it and then just relying on the angry uh\nI mean and I get it I totally get it because of Hollywood is a snake purchasing filled with America ... I Know it's so it's an easy target to laugh so I just I feel I feel cleanse\nIt was great and it also by the way all this crap aside is a magnificent film ... an unbelievable job putting you inside the sole inside the helmet inside the spacecraft is a remarkable movie\nYeah I I I thought it was quite good I mean look and there are reasons to criticize the film I've read a plenty of negative reviews that that she had an intelligent accurate things to say about the film\nBut if you didn't really voting this movie is because you think uh that it ... you are you're you're doing it wrong as hard as we as a kid in fact\nI Know you've got at least one or two new ones but give me thirty seconds is star is born as good as certain people I Know say it is\nI mean look at its high melodrama it is a it is you know we've seen the story before so it's not like there's going to be anything particularly new or interesting a Lady Gaga is fine uh any kind of her first they break out little\nUh for as an actor I'm Bradley Cooper is great I think ... or is the best the best thing about the movie um but it's fine it's it's not really my cup of Tea Party it's undoubtedly well made and it is a the the songs are you know they're good pop\nThere are about in works I'm thinking of things that here's something that's not my cup of tea but I'm prepared to respected did America need a Halloween remake\nAngels America's Choice in senior home care\nWelcome home the\nAnd women who serve their country or coming\nHome to their city in town\nHome to their mountains and valleys\nSome of these warriors are coming\nSome don't you can't\nLike post traumatic stress disorder\nWounded warrior project was created to provide to support these new batteries\nTo ensure their return to America as well adjusted\nWe need your help ensure that our mission is to\nHelp us honor and empower these wounded warriors\nContact I find W.

figure out exactly how to massage the first demand issue [laughter] guess what new sunny and I have in common we both love whew what new study and I have in common we think the first man controversy is ridiculous\nWas it I get against some Chad and some ...\nAnd this caravan of folks coming to the border what do you want to do about it one eight hundred five two oh one two three four one eight hundred five two oh one two three four\nJamal to show he as a human being I care ... named ... she's one of God's Children he was brutally murdered and chopped up in a little bit it's terrible as an American\nHow much am I supposed to twist off about this exact believe\nIt is a question I'm asking maybe you're asking yourself to let's try to cobble some answers together at one eight hundred and five two oh one two three four we're movies coming out this weekend we'll talk about that what study but I just I just got to commiserate with my buddy a man who I be sunny I mean I Love it comes right with you\nI've I've I went to I went to war with this with my Gallagher because ...\nIt's the knee jerk reaction of of of the decade there is no such thing just I'm I'm saying is one time and then then I'll pick it up with sunny if necessary there is no such thing\nAs a human being\nWho has seen first man and thinks the American flag was slighted no such thing\nI'll just leave it at that it is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement I walked out of it as proud to be an American as I've ever been and uh so just if you're sitting here thinking you know\nGlobal is Hollywood pitiful but by the way there's plenty of global is Hollywood ... no no to listen if you're looking for ways in which Hollywood dishonor is America he\nWill not have to look far but don't look at a movie 'cause it does not happen in his magnificent it is the stuff of Oscars for director Damien ... and Ryan Gosling who is no and clarify as Mrs Armstrong he has no perfect as Neal\nThat boy you're talking about the the ears of main job even bigger than Ted Cruz already ten years ago I had a chance to hang with Neil Armstrong I Know how did that happen [noise] well this gig is helpful and living in this town is out but we have a wonderful um [noise] the jewel in the crowd and VFW called the frontiers of flight museum\nAnd ten years ago we did a fortieth anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo program 'cause obviously if you do the math that means the fiftieth anniversary is now and you are correct about that [noise]\nUh and Apollo seven a crewman won't Cunningham does a lot of other astronauts and so I'm looking to Neil and buzz and bill Anders one Apollo eight and Alan ... the leader now late Alan Bean walked on the moon Apollo twelve of Fort Worth guy\nAnd I I I Am seat a panel with all these guys I'm pension myself because believe you me I Am a ... hue and his feelings about the Cleveland Browns that is me and a manned space flight\n... which is probably a horribly clumsy analogy but uh but that that was me I mean I'm sixty right now\nSo in in my pre adolescent years through my adolescent years we're all the Apollo missions I Lived with them I breed them [noise]\nAnd ah it it simply must be a God saying it'll where through through a set of circumstances that I scarcely deserve that I was able to meet and hang out and speak with these folks and Neal is very unassuming he was very much the American hero\nVery much uh the the the uh [noise]\nThe enthusiast for his country but he was also very aware that he was ... it and then he was representing humanity I miss the thing that made me probably the most nuts about the whole first man controversy [noise] it's like we had to pick sides it's either an American achievement\nOr human achievement guys it's both\nThey're not mutually exclusive okay enough about that enough enough enough and I put up a what's the best thing that I can share with you about Ted Cruz and a beta or\nFour months and months and months and months you know maybe not so much lately but for many moons are all the stories were pouring out of my state of Texas\nIt's a close race code Ted Cruz's in trouble who'd Texas is gonna turn purple on the weight of turning blue there's never been a candidate like may do\nTed Cruz is running scared every single one of those stories were crap\nJust to use the vernacular by it was ridiculous it is ridiculous this was never a close race on paper now were there a couple of polls that there was one that had a beta with like a one or two point lead well we know the kind of recent history that polling organizations have had now don't wait\nBut in fairness to that industry\nPolls are a snapshot of enthusiasm\nOf the ... that are taken in the blink of an eye\nSo if you go back when was that ... by one or two a month and a half ago company or something like that the ...
