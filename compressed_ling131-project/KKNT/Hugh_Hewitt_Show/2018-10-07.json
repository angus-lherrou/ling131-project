about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nYou know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects their body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this I'm On a person's honor stressed the body transpose as a stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in there in the upper back and you feel Italian is right at the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the most of the arteries that go up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that\nCompletely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or\nHow many ... at issue it\nHas to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yeah OK yeah it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys you and your body shutdown actually died\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't it diet you know and to us from the bones themself\nNobody will exist will up absorb it back from the bones if ... that's right but I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated hum the calcium at least from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium in absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the house which started right right right but\nThese things don't absorbing the body\nThat's happening for a couple of reasons one when you take a let's say an antacid that had the calcium in it like Tom's first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom\nIs an antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that\nPowder and what happened to be put in hot water and you mix it up and drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\nWill thank you for doing that Dr pain because I really appreciate it folks and this just keeps getting better and better so you get to try ... absolutely risk free and if you're one of the first one hundred callers you're going to get an extra free bottle plus you're going to get that free book\nSo the number to call is one eight hundred eight two three eight eight five seven\nAnd remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eighty two three eight eight five seven and give it to you again it's one eight hundred eighty two three eight eight five seven\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael ... is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but\nYou know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their\nBond [laughter] well that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm going to have a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing going right to their little trips a little leaks here and there and so we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nTo pick his you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles and they need them actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this comics formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drink it over ten day period and it it completely leaving the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both ...\nAnd going down the genetic line you know and if anyone has any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this\nAnd I recently gave a can of this lady was suffering from fibromyalgia\nWhere she was having pain in just about every joint in your body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week\nOf uh the formula that ... formula and um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer may turn out to her friends\nSo that's amazing and when I used that is what the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles and real relax shape\nThe really wouldn't think that to such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and\nAdd to that the medication as\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium needs them in the system well it was very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because his decision and many of them is also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's so it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you
