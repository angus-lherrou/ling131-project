secretary for the national Republican congressional committee I Want I Want a big picture take on a\nRational races because we are twenty seven days away from them again I Know it's a cliche I hate even\nSaying these words but it truly is the most important election in our lifetime if the Democrats take control of the house\nAnd and the Senate we are in major major trouble but you got to see the way the Democrats are behaving\nAnd I know we get a lot of people standing by for this video or about to we're about to play it for you here out of Seattle, Washington a protesters demonstrators taking on police officers get a brutal way it is so profoundly sad\nUh so it was a standby for that we're gonna play that for him that will play it even while we're talking to Jesse Hunter\nHe's a former communications director for Senator Richard Burr Scott Brown pressure cooker jury but the national Republican congressional committee joins us on our guest line\nLouis we just you have any other show how are you [noise] not bad thanks for having me\nHelp me understand thank you give us a thirty five thousand foot view an overview of the congressional races what's at stake what we're up against because quite bluntly I'm tired of hearing well the Republicans are going to hold the set up but they're going to lose the house is that a foregone conclusion\nAt this point in time we are seeing a very volatile environment so from the outset of the twenty Eighteenth cycle we knew was going to be very competitive Democrats are very energized they want all out obstruction bad is that is their\nTheir their overall agenda right now what we're seeing with twenty seven days to go is a resurgence of Republican enthusiasm post a Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings [laughter]\nThat is due in large part to Republicans coming back home ones who who might have been a little uh disinterested in in the mid term election but are seeing what the democratic plan we're already seeing Nancy Pelosi\nAnd other House Democrats line up a litany of potential investigations they plan to undertake if they get control the house and we see on a regular basis their candidates talking about issues like abolishing ice undoing that you'll be tax plan\nAnd protecting sanctuary cities if they're able to regain control the house that is what's at stake in this election and I it has a way of turning off independent voters in motivating Republican base voters\nYou know I I heard of it last night on TV made my blood runs cold Kevin McCarthy pointed out Maxine Waters will become the chair of the house financial services committee if the Democrats take control the house\nLike gosh I I I think that just motivated about three million people to call crawl across broken glass to vote for Republicans in November to have that doozy chairmanship position anywhere I mean we're seeing the difference the stark difference Jesse between the angry mob\nNow there's been a British by the Democrats you heard the comments Eric Holder Hillary Clinton were not going to be civil English to we when my gosh the the protesters and they are all Democrats Jesse these are Republican protesters\nOne hundred percent we don't Maxine Waters is someone who who kicked off missed a reprehensible behavior up saying that they should go in a cost of the White House officials are cabinet members are Republican\nElected officials in their in their whole you know near their homes in restaurants at gas stations wherever they are is that is the type of rhetoric that's being used by the Democratic party day\nAnd that will be calm a kind of common practice if Democrats get in trouble that's why it's so important for Republicans to get out there and vote to match that democratic enthusiasm because this is what they want we saw the ... you know you had the\nPotential twenty twenty presidential candidates up on stage you know during the judiciary hearings cattle you saw the way that they behaved that is going to take on a more of an emphasis as we move past the midterm elections in it to the presidential years up that you know if you combine that\nWith a a a a house led by Nancy Pelosi in a democratic presidential primary going on you're going to see some really a a porn behavior from the Democratic party if they're able to regain control\nJesse ... national Republican congressional committee we appreciate you joining us on the Mike Gallagher show very very much here it is here's the video this was taken by somebody in Seattle a row of police officers are as you listen on the radio on bikes\nAre and they are trying to control a crowd and the mob and listen to the way one of these protesters treat all the police officers she encounters up and down the line

Virginia don't way where Michael\nExiting stage right towards England last night after taking two hundred thousand people in power in southern Virginia and leaving a trail of destruction tears in the panhandle north I Am joined by Dr Larry on President Hillsdale College Hillsdale dot edu for all of your Hillsdale needs\nAnd his online course on church which is apparently very necessary reading for some people in America who pot Churchill gotten to the cabinet business doctor before we begin with justice cabinet um tragedy\nAt this level is a little hard for people\nTo grasp but when you look and see that Panama city's gone Mexico City beaches gone to jail Airforce base which was home to three thousand people in the military [noise] all their possessions are gone but why do you tell your students about tragedy and sadness of it [noise]\nYeah well you got to pick up and go again but that that's you know and this thing's come through and they the water is the big thing you know that when with modern buildings don't really pulled out all that much but the water pumps and that just you know you got to start over\nWhat when when England went through the blitz and large parts of it were destroyed and every night this terrible stuff what happened how ... how did they introduce resilience or was that just part of the national character already\n[noise] well uh you know people don't like being bombed and\n[laughter] it makes them dislike the people who are doing it got really rapidly now they they uh you know Winston Churchill as prime minister of Great Britain and he was pretty good job so not only did he give eloquent speeches it's also\nTrue that they came up with an insurance scheme you know and so you didn't bear the burden of that yourself and the way it worked you know you can drive through London today and if you see a a cluster of old buildings\nAnd then an interruption with new buildings and then the old buildings resume that's a bombing pattern and if you go up a block and he turned left and left again you'll see the same thing repeated in the next block over and so it just cuts swamps down\nOf London and you know if you were in the law and you got you got hammered but it was it was a you know people wanted to know\nWhat's so it's different than you know a natural thing like this there isn't anybody with him to get angry here so I guess you can blame it on me for global warming argue but yeah\nThat was there was a lot of that going on by the way they forget the Labor Day storm of the Nineteen thirties destroyed a lot of Rhode Island they forget Camille in the sixties I mean it it's convenient to golf goes up and down and different years it's up to this year and that made it tougher\nFor ... yeah it did and uh and it if you live on the coast you know and what we see in this Michael thing is that living right on the coast is\nDangerous if you live in the Gulf for letting seaboard but uh if you know she lived five miles and that's not like you're enjoying wonderful coastal living and\nSo those people are getting punished and that's too bad\nYou know I talk this morning with a northern Virginia beach family or because they have two hundred thousand people without without a power down there and so it started in Florida went through Georgia South Carolina North Carolina an exit in Virginia [noise] that's just never happened before that is a weird thing and we're going to\nSee the president respond to it but now and I told everyone uh Tim Roebuck on USA dot org if they want to help out let's turn to the other tragedy which was the violence done to the presumption of innocence\nAnd I think this is a and to the mob rule that with legitimate eyes uh enter the difference between political rallies and chanting lock her up which I don't particularly approval but it's a rally and it's a chance [noise] versus menacing Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant with the imminent threat of violence or the to the mobs in\nPortland [noise] I think we've lost our capacity\nTo distinguish Larry between political speech and political violence\nTo two weeks ago uh I ... I I read something by the car Hanson and I heard a talk at Hillsdale by Charles cancer and they both use the expression cold civil war and uh\nYou know let's just like the early Nineteen fifties right and the main thing is er Eighteen fifty Shia aching and what's the future of it the point is we have to have an agreement\nThat we're going to decide our political differences through a process and the process has to be agrees in advance and especially if the process is hallowed then you don't want to mess with it\nRight if you if you read Lincoln's great first inaugural\nAddress he says that the first time that\nA ballot ever placed bullets in a fundamental to close the dispute with an Eighteen hundred in the United\nStates of America which I think it's true [laughter] so so the point is you're going to do with the the people under the constitutional process sees a majority in the Senate and the president of the same party and he gets to elect a bunch of people on the Supreme Court that can't be planned in advance\nThat's you know that's how the constitution works and so\nTo obstruct the process 'cause you know what what I think is it was a shame for this thing even to be taken up and the reason is\nThat that lady seems like a science lady and soon as sincere but there was no evidence for this and it happened you know a human generation ago when Brett Kavanaugh was it was a kid so the thing is that something that you just would not be able to get to the bottom of\nIt is it is a problem approve the very beginning that ought to have been recognized and interminable but it was politicized who was weaponized\nPaused for a moment of colds or work as a veteran I have a disagreement about this from Charles in I I went up the ante them two weekends ago and that's a hot civil war that twenty three thousand people dead in one day from a dunk or church all the way down to burn side bridge and\nEven in the Eighteenth fifties we had you know John Brown and the Bush wanders in Kansas and stuff like that but we're not there but I Do think the warning about what happens when we don't realize\nThat debate can be fierce but you cannot men is that is the constitutional passed by the way and in the in the Supreme Court which is the intention and the ability to incite violence is illegal it's not protected speech\nThat's right that's right and you know the so I I think I said this on a couple of weeks ago but in in the Nineteen forty five Winston Churchill lost the election to the socialist who may he said what ultimately result in it to stop and the socialist\nGot forty eight percent of the vote and they got over sixty percent of the seats and so\nOf course the conservatives were rumblings about that and Churchill gives them a species the leader of the opposition now and he says\nWe're not gonna complain about that this is the constitutional system this is how they got in and this is how we're going to replace them and so you know it contrast that with the ... and that's ... that's the electoral college and now the Senate in the country in other\nWords there isn't any constitutional range but that shouldn't be that it's not subject to a salt in the interest of partisan politics of the day\nIt is true everything is under assault and if you're not on the right thing in\nThe media will\nAbsolutely demonize you and by the media I mean the broadcast networks with the exception of Fox I mean the big newspapers I mean the beltway Manhattan Media late they are on the left\nAnd they will demonize you if you are not on the left and they will protect you if you are and Kanye West is finding out big time on CNN where they are mocking him in terms that were any other commentator to use concerning any other minority that come to her would be off the\nAir yeah well we did have the Donald Trump rule now and that is anything can be said about him or anybody connected to him [laughter] that's a new feature of American politics\nThe repeat that that is true that you can't go low there is nothing so low about Trump that will get thrown off the air yeah me neither I Am in violence may be a threat of violence that would do it\nYeah well that's a crime as you said\nAnd not protected speech in a violence against the president in this particular crime or so they don't they don't do that but I mean there's a movement to impeach Brett Kavanaugh going on right now and it's in you know that the chief justice his refer\nA paper trail and he's got\nSome young guy just out of the blocks right he's he's been so there's a huge amount of material and it's obvious that they're getting ready to vote for him\nAnd then this stuff is brought up and that is not fair or a good political maneuver and if she transferred to add to what it would take to convict the guy up something which is rightly a different standard than just making that argument\nAbout politics and this is crazy 'cause it would never go anywhere\nAnd when we come back we're going to play for your um view the seminal\nExchange in the media John Dickerson and Mitch McConnell talking about judges and what people have to understand about the constitution and the structure of the constitution and why the walking that seat was right because the Republicans had the majority\nAnd that's how we one thing in the country according to the constitution said to them are here to your

pounded here for Hillsdale dot com and the next five minutes matter a lot but some people Brett Kavanaugh was injured his reputation was injured yes he is adjusted to the United States Supreme court he will have twenty five thirty thirty five years God willing\nTo write opinions that will be his legacy but Churchill whom you've studied your entire life often ... sailed\nBy criticisms some fair mostly unfair how did you deal with that Larry ...\nA well he uh this is a ah this this will be a controversial point with people probably but uh we have changed the libel and slander law is in America is a lot done in England and he would shoot people if they said things that were not true\nOh oh I didn't know he was led to just well not you know huge amount but uh like a fellow ah\nThere's a lot of Alfred Douglas and there's a guy wrote a book and you know accused and said that when he was little boy was\nThe sentence was he stole and he was upbeat and made him take that back you know it's like kind of parallel to Kevin alright yeah he he wrote in a favorable book about church Patricia was it the one he was in high school and turned somebody didn't take it back\nAnd uh you know Churchill's famous areas went to see the ... and the guy was prostrate before Churchill you know they just trying to write a\nFavorable book and Churchill was tough about it he demanded a complete retraction and he got it and his name uh well uh there's another guy I Can't remember the guy's name but there is another guy in the lord Alfred ... just always with a scandal about Churchill all the time\nAnd they have litigation and they were and you know but the thing is if somebody\nWhat we've done now is we have made it so that if you are deemed a public figure than it's very difficult for you to to have any relief if somebody tells a law against cues that harms shoo [noise]\nAnd that is one of the reasons why the media is so ... you know I mean on both the left and the right\nThen I also like New York times be celibate because I'm In this business and I can say right now that you know Larry are and murdered someone last night in Michigan and you\nCan't sue me [laughter] you probably could get that I Would that would be knowing disregarded the facts but I could come pretty doggone close to that in any other you know you can just make wild assertions in in American media and we are beyond touched because of New York ... I like that but that is not the case in Great Britain\nAnd if so Kevin Oh gosh you know he he he's got children right and he has seen image by this year your point is not just that\nHe might not have gotten confirmed on the Supreme Court nobody has a right to that but your point is his personal reputation has been hard back when he will ever after the\nThe person who you know ... of the things right and they'll never be resolution of it and that link his children will be on the inside but how better if he chose to do it for them to be able to say they had to retract that because that wasn't true\nThey're they're at a trade off here um because\nIt is true Thirty years from now some of them will be using\nThe ... claims against their kids to hurt them\nThinner them right they'll tell you that we all know that had and I knew that what was weighing on it because you and I are both fathers right and so we know that that weighs on a parrot that what people say about it you will be used against your children and so I understood is anger and I would have been\nDone if he was not that angry\nYeah that's right and and you know you you I urge you because you run your show at a certain

Michael existed in the Atlantic last night roaring through Virginia I think down in Virginia Beach Norfolk Hampton Roads area it's\nA lot of power lines are down at center out to be posted on that point you're so welcome the guy would be in charge in Ohio or a disaster to happen next year for the next four years Mike DeWine he's the attorney general in Ohio right now he's running for governor in one of the most closely watched races in the United states\nOr a senator now attorney general DeWine welcome back to the euro ... great to have you\nHere it's great to be back with you and your listeners thank you very much\nOne of the things I think when we watch Michael come ashore governor a jar Gerald the wind is we listen to candidates and we think to ourselves are they are they able to handle the crisis and you've been doing this a long time now but but speak to Richard Cordray your your opponent has been a lawyer and a lawyer and he's\nBeen a lawyer or how about you [laughter]\nYou know I've really tackle some tough problems and the interesting thing or if you compare court or a A N and Mike DeWine is that we both were attorney generals and you know I beat him eight years ago close race but I but I began but what we inherited a was a real mess or the attorney general\nOhio runs the state crime labs and when we took office a court right left us was if there was a rape or serious crime that occurred in Ohio on the unknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab [noise]\nUm it was sat there if you can believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without him by overlooking at that's how far\nBack off that they had and a quarter I left that mess and so we fixed it uh we turned cases around now a\nTwenty four hours if it's an emergency or would do is four times as much DNA as we did the day he left office and me are average time is about three weeks but we can turn case around very very quickly and another thing that he couldn't bear\nCordray and what we've done now he left 'em and they were they were old rape kit sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio law states that have this problem or he didn't do anything about it what I became attorney general we've we\nStarted hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out to the police say bring it to us ah we want to get this evidence\nAre tested and we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some as these are all court cases old cases uh some some Fifteen Years old\nAnd we've got hit shore matches in thirty six percent so we've gone back\nYou know and better than a third and told the the local police who then turned told the victim hey we got your right to where we got your rapists and in Cuyahoga County alone and Cleveland where we had a large large number of them are they they have a indicted over seven hundred and fifty people\nRate while as all of that so it it's it's a great lesson and you see a problem you go after it a quarter right just\nJust sat there and didn't uh you know do anything and don't forget a course his time ah\nHeading up Obama's a consumer group out in Washington if you if you recall\nUh we we saw for example because of overregulation we ... we saw\nThe number of our community banks or go down significantly in Ohio and I'm sure that occurred in in other states as well just because of the over over regulation a quarter a and others had in place\nNow now I got to ask you a general DeWine the idea that Ohio which is doing well in this recovery\nI mean we've got I Know northeastern are pretty darn well I Know a large town is cook and I know that that's kind of country as well up in moaning in Trumbull county ... county Cuyahoga County it's cooking why in the world would return the state over to the left the uh the last ... I mean what in the world well that people think think about\nThat that look that's absolutely right we're we're we're doing well in Ohio a we do not want to go back to where we were eight years ago eight years ago when quarter a I'm\nA ... you know was was attorney general and a ... you know he was the attorney general state of Ohio we had had lost a\nClose to four hundred thousand jobs\nAh and you know we just were not moving our unemployment rate was high and in the last eight years under Republican conservative leadership uh we've kept taxes to Alex cut taxes are we seeing the economy move forward and so\nYou know what I Want to do my running mate John ... we will take awhile to the next level or we've come a long long way we do not want to go back uh we've got we've got a couple of challenges out there we had an opiate problem that we that we have to get in front of it now instead of a you know people\nAre not being able to find jobs and not the economy not moving forward our biggest challenge now for employers is to find people who are qualified or people who are able to pass a drug test so\nWe're really focusing on you is is two things one is tackling a drug problem whether to appoint action plan that makes makes real sense it's realistic or some other things I'm already shirt have already started to do is attorney general but there are things I Can't do until\nTill I I'm governor I made a lot of things that we want to we think is very important is education and prevention for young young kids in regard to drugs or you know I started my career as a county prosecuting attorney and I can tell you that\nI don't know in five years or ten years if we'll have an opiate problem but it there's always some drug problems and so we prepare young people starting as early as getting a garden\nK. to twelve so the age appropriate every year every year or something that's been proven to to actually work we will implement that\nAnd it will make a huge difference the the other thing that we're we really want to do is doubled out on President Trump's opportunities owns a were have opportunities owns Ohio this will mirror the tax cuts are and and the job act\nThat the president and Congress put through\nA we will make it so that a semi looks at the state of Ohio and I said well that's the place to invest that's where I I Want to take my ... capital gains I Want to take a ticket to Ohio or put do this in our most problematic areas and you know we we believe that\nA given that tax break I was going to get a lot of money to be invested in Ohio we hope from uh\nThe country are very ...\nYeah if you take that up the young son warned given the physical structure that exists there already and your combined with economic opportunity and it will cook I talked with a mounting valley chamber when they came to DC on their fly and the first she had to win tonight I'm finding the Columbus Ninety eight Ninety answer dot com if people want to

gets going in the Buckeye State doesn't it I mean we're we're ...\nWe're into it we should we ... we started this week and uh you know we're ... we've seen a since the cabin up a\nNomination and what the Democrats did and what happened in the Judiciary Committee we we've seen a real a firing up of our conservative base in Ohio and Kelly is all over the state and you and you mentioned\nYou mentioned in an area of the state of Ohio ... in eastern Ohio them hunting valley for example\nA which are very very familiar with you know historically historically\nBig big a Democrat area but socially conservative and\nWhat we saw course is what what President Trump did when he ran and did exceedingly well or in areas that you know have never in in several lifetimes have not been gone on Republican\nTroubled county went for Trump patio happened since I think Nixon\nThought sure that's right it's been it's been a long time but but you're right we lay on the way our opportunities on top of that I mean\nWe ... we have them with with the tax bill but we're on doubled out at all because we're a say or don't do that with our ...\nOur tax code in the state of Ohio too and we really believe that that's going to have a lot of investment [noise] ah we ... we can't have there's there's not enough government money out there to have government investment and have a\nWe have to get the private sector and ... and we have some great things going for us and a lot of areas but with this\nWith this tax cut that we're talking about and that opportunity um it's really for economic development all\nLast question attorney general Mike DeWine gonna be next governor Ohio and I was there for Rob Portman before I joined NBC and had to stop doing fundraisers there like a thousand

Woodward describes\nWell the Obama policy they described as strategic patience\nOr that is a synonym for doing nothing about North Korea and it's another example of a ... bill coming due for President Trump or I think the combination\nOf the potential use of military force against North Korea and the the maximum pressure campaign that the president waged on the economic front is one has brought that Kim John on to the table Mike Pompeo has just returned from another trip there will see a meeting I think between\nA chairman Kevin President Trump sometime in the next couple of months\nOr we'll see other efforts go forward the president has held the door open for North Korea he gave him a great little of the movie and er in Singapore\nWhen he met with Kim Jong on that showed what North

I don't think it affected me in any way either up at the un or in my dealings within the administration I think it's a job where you have to be\nPrepared to get deep into the substance of issues I think it's very important in implementing policy and mostly what you do at the un has implement policy that you\nUnderstand the significance of the actions you're taking a ended it'd be part of a team I I felt very privileged when I was there I help make policy but I help mostly to carry policy out\nSome national security advisers travel a lot some stay close to the oval office what's your travel schedule like looking forward especially between now and they're like well\nI've spent most of my time in Washington or or traveling with the president when he travels overseas or I have done some travel I've got a trip coming up to Moscow in the caucuses countries uh in about ten days\nReason for that is to continue to carry through on the\nConversation that President Trump and president prudent hadn't Helsinki during the summer to talk about\nU.S Russian relations and where we can make progress where we still have issues and disagreement or and then the Caucasus to see the very significant geographical a role that they have dealing with Iran dealing with Russian dealing with turkey\nSo it's selected I work very closely with Jim Mattis and I ... we had breakfast this morning as we do once a week to kick all these issues around and I think that's very important that the national security advisor I think under any presidential style has to be an honest broker and I I work\nHard at that when you sit down with your hair hurt Russia next week are you going to tell him hands off our election I may say three or four times loudly\nYeah well every time I met with the Russians in this job including with President putting himself when I went to Russia to prepare for the Helsinki meeting I made that point as has the president\nIs a message to believe that we received well so far we don't see the kind of Russian meddling we did and twenty sixteen\nChris Wray the director the FBI said a couple of weeks ago that that could change with the stroke of McKay we are very worried about the question of Chinese interference not just in individual elections\nBut more broadly trying to influence the American political\nDiscussion with an influence campaign that uh I I think could well be unprecedented we heard vice president Pence speak to this issue or last week it was a very important speech I think people need to read and then consider it a and I think the United states needs to stand up frankly to any foreign government\nThat thinks it's going to interfere in our politics we are a self governing people\nWe will govern ourselves we don't need international institutions\nTo tell us how to do it and we particularly don't need foreigners are trying to exert undue influence over\nIs what about a transition to the story of the day Jim all the shocking we're trying to influence the response of the Saudi Government to the world at noon on Thursday are you satisfied with what the Saudis have told us about the disappearance of Mr ...\nWell I don't think we've we've known enough or I spoke with the crown prince yesterday along with Jared Kushner a secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke to the crown prince is well the the president has spoken to this issue or it is something we need to get resolved and uh we need to do it as soon as possible in\nThe aftermath of the an hour's newsroom shooting somebody criticized the president or who has the enemy of the people were in the aftermath of shocking to severe and some people upset or the president is turning a blind eye to violence against journalists are\nAcross the world to clean Russia where do you make a critic for the president trying to tie him to the show as well\nI think this is ridiculous I mean I think this is a he has spoken out about it\nUh he's directed a secretary said Tom pay oh\nA to speak with a can show he's a fiance and that'll happen as soon as they can get that scheduled a we're taking a number of other steps or that I really can't get into at the moment but I think that uh it's just a hypocritical to say that somehow the president's not concerned about these things when manifestly\nHis words in his actions are to the contrary\nA mouse or Saudi Arabia and political structure to the best Congo looted is it possible way out of Henry the second situation of his mental some praise spiraling out of control or even something more malevolent that someone intending to undermine the crowd of ... and the king be in this action\nYou know honestly we just don't know what the facts are and that was one of the points that are that I made to the crown prince uh we need to find out what the facts are and we need to get this resolved quickly because if it is a a a a another operation\nA people need to understand that I I think the the Saudis themselves are
