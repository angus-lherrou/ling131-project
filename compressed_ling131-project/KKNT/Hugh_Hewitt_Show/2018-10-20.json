{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "It was a lot more just here's a great investment let's sell them let's sell this plan on this thing that makes us the commission\nThat's not an your best interest that index attracts the five hundred largest us stocks have doubled their money sooner than every seven years and the average American has barely outpaced inflation according to ... that's mostly because we don't have a map\nAnd we're not getting good advice everything's skewed in Wall Street's favor and the broker dealers favor and your brokers favor and not in yours\nFor the average American has made four percent when the simplest strategies of you know getting on a van garden logged in in four seconds and open it has to be five hundred index fund in your account\nHas made a life in the stakes are way to hide this is all of what you saved and that's the purpose of this show each and every week is that\nI Want to be able to pull back the curtain for you and just say look this isn't a knock on how much I despise your advisor or the industry I used to do all these things I was trained in how to do these things that's why I ...\nThat's the whole thing and started Keystone and that's what all of our advisors you're left their banks and broker dealers and insurance companies to remove the conflicts and do it directly for our clients that is why I Do this radio show\nThat's why I offer you this retirement ... we don't need more business I Love helping people and providing perspective for you so you can do a good job on your money that's why I promote come in and get a retirement ... view\nBecause I Want to give you a second opinion that actually shows you here's what your pain right now here's actually what your risk is here's what the market's done versus how you've done will your income hold up can you retire when you want to wait and should you take Social Security\nHow are you going to get the money out of your eye reason for one case tax efficiently we just had the biggest tax reform since the Reagan Administration should you get a retirement after you do you need a road map\nI mean here's a really good question to ask yourself when is the last time that your financial adviser asked to see your tax return when does the last time they have a review your tax return and gone through proactively tax strategies for you\nAsk yourself that question basically a year ago we had the biggest tax reform since the Reagan Administration has your advice or even talk to you about how that impacts your money because if you're like most Americans the majority of what you have saved are indifferent accounts that have never been tax that are going to be required to be taxed\nAnd your advisor has built no roadmap whatsoever regarding how you're going to get that money out there are more interested in trying to sell you a variable annuity or non trade reeds for them to make it ten percent commission on and that's the problem with the industry\nSo getting back to the road map if you would like your own tailor to customize roadmap that hits on everything from taxes to risk to season expenses\nAnd everything else is important you we've done that for hundreds of people just like you can listen to the radio show and you can request that by going to Keystone wealth partners dot com and right on the home page there's a spot but says would you like to retire map review\nYou put it in your basic ... a member of my team will call you Monday morning and schedule a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our financial advisors no costs no obligation you can share with us what's going on in your life and then we'll mutually determine if a retirement that makes sense for you if it'd be helpful and we are happy to provide you your Taylor road map if you'd like that\nSo we can go to Keystone well partners dot com\nTo request your retirement map review right now and so the last two steps on your flight plan on your road map is landing safely and enjoying the destination upon arrival so landing the let's talk about that\nThe most critical to parts of the flight as an airline pilot is at takeoff and landing but I think you would to ... know that as a passenger on these flights\nBut landing safely at the end of the day once you get up in the air this whole thing is it really great I mean we can get you all the way above Miami but if we don't get you on the ground safely but it's pretty safe to say that we didn't really accomplish our goal here\nRight in landing is a lot more technical than when you're sitting up in crews and so how do we apply this to our retirement situation if you weren't nearing retirement or getting into retirement right now\nYou're kind of landing right now you're the part of the flight where you're you're dropping down the landing gear and you're getting on the island approach right and you're talking to the tower now and you're trying to monitor air speeds and you're putting down your flaps and you're checking your levels are we are we hire we low right we've got a flair as we get into ground affect me get near the runway\nAll of these things are going to set it down we have to not slam those we'll down we have to set it down softly right we need to correct in crab into the wind up there is a cross wind use your writer to balance it out I mean all these things I Know you're going John would get it you like flying I Do love flying all of a B Asian\nWhat point B and that's a critical part of the flight and for your financial planning for your financial road map you better have that strategy because just like on a flight how critical the landing in the landing is unbelievably important related to your retirement plan\nDo you have planned out how much risk you should have we're going to draw income from should you raw convert when are you taking Social Security do you need more growth not enough growth\nWhere do you position the assets should roll out of your retirement plan should you take the lump sum pension should you take the income stream all of these things and so much more are part of that landing and we've helped hundreds of people land successfully I mean that's the whole idea right that's where you rely on for your airline pilot\nI landed airplanes hundreds of times successfully and I got my passengers safely to the gate and I've done the same thing here Keystone and we'd love to do that for you if you're not sure exactly how you need to be landing the airplane\nCall us and get your retirement preview will break down exactly what that looks like for you and the number one eight hundred seven six seven\nFifteen Fifteen out again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen I call my team right now and schedule your retirement map preview we'll talk about how to land the airplane safely and it all starts with on that phone call my team is going to schedule a Fifteen minute phone call was one of our financial advisors that's what you're committed to call us right now\nYou're getting a roadmap a one page tailored road map for your situation and you're committed to a Fifteen minute phone call was one of our advisors who just wants to hear about your story and what's going on in your life how we can maybe help you and as I wrap up the last thing is enjoying the destination upon arrival maybe one of the most important things that we often don't mapped out\nIs once we get to our destination water our goals\nLike once we get to our destination what's the plan like what matters to us I talked earlier in the show about on a broader scale than financially like my road map in life is a Christian is the Bible and I know somebody was nice to have different face but\nI'm able to go back to that plum line on decisions big decisions\nAbout what we're going to be about as a family about what I'm going to instill in our children about where they're going to go to school about the way we're going to treat other people about the fact that we're going to adopt two older children from Ethiopia like those sorts of decisions the fact that we get back\nTo charity water every year here accused on what part of so we dig wells and villages in Ethiopia that's a huge part of what we do with our clients do we do that together with our clients you\nWell those are easy decisions when you have a map for how you're going to live your life and\nThey don't hear me saying that as as pompous at all like I Wish I could say that I that I Do that perfectly all the time and I follow my map all the time and I don't I Wish I did I don't make mistakes we all do right but it's a whole lot easier to know when we're off course and we have a map that is one of the beauties the map is when we're off course we know we are\nAnd in life in my life when I'm off course it's really easy for us to say hey\nYou're you're off year man and it's easier to say that because she goes look here's our ... here's how we know we want to live here so what we want to be about it with your money you need to know when you're off course and if you don't have a map to begin with if you don't have your quote unquote Bible\nFor financial planning you know if you don't have anything that's really breaking down and and specifically stating how it is you're going to invest how you're going to land how you're going to just along the way how to prepare for your flight you're just as James talks about the Bible you're just blowing and tossing in the wind like a wave of the sea\nWe want to give you clarity we want to give you that roadmap we've done it for hundreds of people this entire show has been about ... getting a road map you having a road map you know when your course you know in your destination you know when when you're off course\nWe have a weight to give you that and it takes an hour of your time and we have offices in Chandler as well Scottsdale and it cost you nothing and it comes with no obligation\nSo call us right now at one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty not again the number one eight hundred\nSeven six seven Fifteen fifty not\nTo get your tailored one page retirement map review and for most of us and he only very clear at this will be the first time you've ever sat down with someone like us a reformed broker an independent registered investment advisor from who is not looking to sell you something but rather give you a clear\nAnd an understandable breakdown of exactly where you stand with your money get that second opinion and get your very own customized one page retirement map review by calling one eight hundred\nSeven six seven Fifteen Fifteen and again that was one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nAnd if you've hung in here for the whole show I appreciate it I Love being able to share with us on my heart today show was a little bit different talking a lot about just the roadmap how we provide a roadmap for you and how important it is for you to have a road map\nI went a little off script I talked about things like my faith and my family\nAnd I hope that was okay with you for me to share my heart a little bit but I Would love to hear your story but that's really what we're passionate about here Keystone as I share some of my story each and every week with you we love hearing what's going on your lives your family's lives what you're trying to accomplish I mean some of the goals that you have when you come in and talk with us\nJust massive encourage it to me and my team to hear the things that you're doing for others and the aspirations you have in your lives and the things that you've done the experiences that you've had our share an encouragement\nTo me so if you choose to come in and chat with us and go through the retirement map review process I'd be very grateful for the opportunity to get to know you better and of course before acting upon anything disgusted they seek the guidance of an independent credential to share who can assess your individual circumstances\nPay a premium for them to avoid negotiating in many cases or if they do negotiate still pay a premium\nThen with interest rates being higher on used cars the new birds typically and certainly no rate specials [noise] um you know from the manufacturers are new cars there can be zero percent and point nine percent and and different things will\nRemember the other thing is is in October two thousand Seventeen\nRam offered zero percent on Seventy two months\nI helped eleven people in October two thousand Seventeen by dodge ram pickup trucks now one of them\nUp to ... percent because of what you have to give up\nNow when you go into a car dealership and you bring up the zero percent here's what I'm gonna tell you just going to happen Ninety nine percent of the time the salesman\nIs if he's smart is not going to show you the better way to pay for the car he's going to take the path of least resistance she's going to do exactly what you asked for and he's going to show you what does your own by China's without giving you the option 'cause the option gives you the opportunity to say you know\nAfter thinking about that I Need to go home and think about this for a little while\nWhich you should be able to do of course you are in America but but kind of going back to the people that are buying needs to late model\nCars pound paying arguably in many cases too much for them and then having to finance them for six years which then increases the interest rate [laughter]\nPut these people in a situation where they think they won the battle by not going to the dealer and not negotiating but in three years' time if he wanted to go trade that car that they thought they were so wise to buy chances are they're going to have a tremendous amount of negative equity\nYou know it's it's funny like I say when Dan and I talk we in the radio station there is a computer and I look on line I look at MSN and I look at\nMSN on us and you can look at today you could look at research you can look listings you can look up buying it can look at news you can look at all those shows enthusiasts [noise] motorcycles compare cars classic an ownership now this was kind of sad because I looked at the news\nAnd I will get the news how many people really care about BMW coming out with another super car I think very few people how many people are considering an SUV built by ...\nI'm probably about ten people on the planet now they get to this part where it says on the bottom recalls\nAnd I want to take a second because when you buy a car they gather your information and today they actually have you normally sign a piece of paper that the time of delivery and there are no known recalls on your vehicle this is if you're buying a pre on car typically and if you\nIf there is a recall you recall you will be notified by the manufacturer or the national highway Transportation Safety administration not the dealership but this is what's crazy dream jeep is recalling the new wrangler for this scary reason potential\nFrame separation Toyota recall two point four million hybrid vehicles founder accelerates airbag recall on one point four million vehicles\nNow done several males sedans SUVs recalls her engine fires Cadillac ... recalls fifty three thousand feet ts sedans\nHonda recalls two hundred and thirty two sedans for backup cameras problem Honda recalls one point four million there's the airbag recall and the and Slater's\nNico Nissan recalls two hundred and Fifteen thousand now turned Fifteen thousand cars GM recalls one point two million vehicle one quick thing\nTo mention is he's going to this long married a list of recalls you want to punch in the number of your car into the national Highway Traffic because you're right there in Atlanta I recall if there's any recall on your car that's all you had to do is punch the vehicle identification number of your car into the NHL TSA website and they will tell you\nNow here's the other thing you want to remember when you read a recall\nThe three words you don't want to see when you see the recall remedy not available right which means and I and and I don't laugh about it but I get a kick out of it when someone tells me well that's not right they have to be able to fix it will guess why folks it is a piece\nMechanical equipment if they don't have the six now here's the ones that become scary when you're looking at a vehicle and you find out that if you have a Honda and you traded into a Honda dealership and you can't they can't sell your car\nIt's called they stop shell or stop sale means that there is no remedy for the recall and as an authorized Honda dealership they can't retail that car however if you trade that car in at a\nFord dealership to this is the importance of what Dana mentioned if you're buying a used car\nThere's nothing wrong with fans of the salesman can can we log into a computer with the national highway Transportation Safety administration and make sure there is no recalls because if you buy a car and there's an open recall and you get home and decide you don't want to car because it has an open recall I don't believe that some reason you get to return\nThe car for well as a matter of fact you know but it's not a reason you get to return the car for but one of the things that I haven't we haven't talked about in a while and it's it's a big part of every time someone goes to a dealership to buy a car\nAnd they agreed to terms and regardless of how long that takes and regardless of what that negotiation process is\nThe very next step is to go to the business houses or technically the finance office where the gentleman or lady that sits in that chair\nAre typically the most skilled negotiators that work in the dealership and if you think about it it's not that complicated if you just spend all the time to stand to finally agreed to terms and gave up everything that you felt was possibly reasonable and agree to the highest payment you would pay for the longest term you would pay at\nThe nice people you're about to me\nThat's where they began each and every time and I had a client in fact it was to show them and that was the gentleman who was a radio show issue that brought to making Subaru when they brought the printout out with a payment on it\nThere was a spread us ten dollars per month and he looked at it and he said\nHow can that be and I said you know you're one of the first people that ever actually paid attention to that and guess what it can't be\nIf you have an exact rate and the exact amount finance an exact term than your payment is your\nThey put all three things all the variables were there and that's the key all\nVariables are there now one of the things that gets me and I and I don't have so many ... yeah some one of the things that I I pay attention to what I see in a car dealership yet we do so I was sitting there the other day and I watched the finance managers come out and she's a train Slayer\nMeans that she's extremely skilled at what she does and she may not play fair\nNow when she sat down with the people and she smiled and said I have the basic questions for you so I can put together the best financial package for you ... I was like folks you have no idea what you're in for right now you have no idea and then I happen to walk by her office in the door was open and I heard her\nExplanation of the prepaid maintenance the wheel entire protection the ... the key fob replacement the paint list and repair\nPaint Zealand paint feeling the mess and one of those jak people say well that'll make sense that protects the car completely it makes my skin crawl\nIt's probably somewhere between four and ten thousand dollar mistake to answer the question that way [laughter] depending on where you are and what it is you're buying the\nPurpose that Gary and I approach each and every time and to help our clients who are financing\nTo get the best rate that they can qualify for unless of course taking the zero percent does make sense and it really each situation stands on its own there are times when it absolutely does make sense to use their zero percent [noise]\nBut there are countless times when it simply does not\nHelp somebody today that had financing would desert schools and it wasn't the greatest rape and they but they wanted to go to the desert schools but there was this\nPoint nine percent financing now which Seventeen foul sours ... dollars down\nTo point nine didn't make sense to twenty five hundred dollar rebate did\nBut the gal that bought the Highlander with no money down to point nine financing made sense because without the down payment with finance and the whole amount the finance charge was less than what the rebates are but these are the things that Dana and I understand and know\nAnd and of course a guide to you too because the the one thing when Jerry alluded to that nice young lady coming out and talking about how she was going to prepare the financial package it best suited the client\nShe was going to put together the package that best suited the dealership and her cells\nNot now the thing I felt good about what she's never missed a car payment\nAnd he has some stuff that's on his credit report that\nThat's reported correctly but incorrectly and I know that sounds crazy but he'd got with the company that was working on paying off to get and they hadn't fix that on his credit report yet so it was showing that his credit card debt was so far behind it wasn't even funny when in fact it's all covered\nWell again each and every circumstance stands on its own and and we recognize that there's lots of people out there who [noise] you know whether they enjoy horse trading whether these things are truly can outsmart the dealer or or can actually leave the dealership\nWith a better outcome with out us helping them\nAs if they really truly feel that way than to say God Bless you and and go have fun [laughter]\nWe're here to help the people that understand that when you go into a car dealership and it doesn't matter if it's ... or a used car dealership or a new car dealership\nYou either have all the knowledge and skills sense that\nYou would need or they gain I possess in order to make sure that they do not in any way shape or form\nTake advantage and we're very very strict in we deal and work with a lot of wonderful people in the auto industry\nThat is Gary's mentioned several times they understand why we're there we're not there for them ... we might like them and they may be someone that we enjoy dealing with because of who they are\nBut we are there solely for the purpose of our clients we if for any reason our clients not thrilled were gone out of there and have no reason to stay\nMore often than not though almost every

in a dealership at that price because they don't just because they don't order I'm that way I don't want to them that way but\nBack in the day and I remember this if you went to me um W. dealership you could look at a\nThree series a five series seven seven series a X. five\nNow how many are there oh there's probably a ... year old games are well over a hundred and you keep talking well when

tremendous challenge because\nI Know for a fact but several years ago they had over a hundred different versions of BMWs that you could buy it and I know that number is only gone up not down\nBut leaving that out of the equation Gary's looking at the new number the [noise] the reason that we have done this for as long as we have is to provide a service like no other\nThere was nobody than I should say this carefully I'm sure there are people that that would potentially have the skill sets that Gary and I possess and we'd be you know able possibly to to do exactly what it is that we do\nThere's just not anybody that we've ever found that would be willing to do it um meaning that they're either running car dealerships her or doing something that is far different than than what we're doing we are not brokers we do not take kickbacks\nWe work on me for a client's best interest and the proof I guess we have to be in the putting in that were absolutely free and that's you're completely satisfied in the paperwork and every piece that affects you is protected\nAnd now with out\nLooking at the individual models and every trim line when you go to a BMW and you click on the word vehicles\nAre there are one two three four five six twelve Seventeen different variations in vehicles\nAnd that's without going two or three series and seeing how many different three series you can get without going to the end models without going through the eyes three that I\nNow once again now they came back with an age series which replaced\nThe six series coup\nIt's gotta be one of the hardest cars to help somebody by used or even Neal because when you look\nAt a Honda you're buying a model\nAnd they come with exact same with Clinton each and every time that it's that model when\nYou look at a hundred thousand dollar BMW and you look at a ... another car that's exactly the same price in the same trend line the cars could have known even twenty different things funny different things so what I always tell people it's like my friends' parents that are buying the car\nThe Mercedes I told them why would you settle\nFor something that's not exactly what you want\nWhen you're going to spend that much money and and and and it's on an investment into it's a it's a choice it's a luxury but if you're going to choose to spend that much money by God you should not settle for one single thing\nUnder any circumstances unless you're forced to and obviously when you can order the car and have a bill to be exact specifications are you a bike [laughter]\nWhy on earth would you pay for it features that not only costs money but you don't see value and and and give up something that that is important to you when you get into a certain price range [laughter]\nUm you know in\nThe dealership of course would like to buy from their stock because that's obviously easiest for them but you're the person that's shelling out all this money ... settle for a damn thing\nYou know and it's you know I'm looking at this new am a safety\nDr coup ex drive it's five hundred and twenty three last hour top speed a hundred and fifty five miles an hour and then when they say top speed hundred and fifty five miles an hour it's because they won't let you go faster than that I Believe it will go faster and some of the cars they should all have that the governor's you know\nAnd I\nIt's when you're buying something by what you want don't let you know people ask me what do I think in a lot of times I'll say folks it doesn't matter what I think it's my opinion\nBut if you ask me which I Would buy or would I Would do or this or that you know another important thing that's the take into consideration is when you're buying a car I mean the young lady that I helped by the Highlander\nShe was replacing a two thousand Eighteen highland was replacing in Nineteen Ninety One Pontiac Montana\nAnd she actually looked at me and said God I Can't wait to see what happens to my insurance now she has a credit she has a great track record but obviously now I'll tell you this I was kinda surprised that\nUh we get that you each and every week it talks a little bit about what happened in the past week as well as what are some upcoming economic issues are that you'll be seeing in the coming week\nSo it gives you a little bit of an insight or looking back and looking forward

on or just a pass over the things that aren't of interest to you\nBut again it's absolutely free and it also gives you some tips each week talks about the riddle that we talk about each week a and also just some just new things that are happening out there in the world of a ... and the economics that we're all facing okay so\nUm I Am a pasta lover I don't know how many of you out their love pasta but\nAh who doesn't like past I guess is what I should say over three hundred and fifty known pasta shapes folks believe it or not out there that you could\nHave a different dish for dinner just about every day of the year well this past Wednesday October seventeenth\nThat was the official day to celebrate pasta so hopefully you guys went out and had some pasta I Know I didn't I just loved it I have my favorite restaurants that I go to\nFor pasta of course I was a part of town you know I still am part Italian and my grandmother on my mother's side she used to make all her own pasta she was an amazing cook\nAnd we used to go there every Sunday we'd spend just about all day there we can get there in the morning we'd have breakfast my grandfather cook breakfast\nThen my grandmother would be in the kitchen rolling out the pasta for lunch and then we take our little break and then we'd have pasta for dinner [laughter] because I loved it it was fantastic I miss those days but of course so that's why I'm proud of my favorite Italian restaurants that I go to which I Love\nTo have my pot that when I go to those [noise]\nAll right so as I said each week we do a mention our weekly riddle and last week's riddle was what rock group has four members but neither of them sing the answer is Mount Rushmore folks that\nGroup right there for a car bombings in Iraq and well\nNeither of them saying so I was a fun little rental this week's riddle and again you'll get this each and every week if you do sign up for our weekly economic update is what's the longest word in the dictionary what is the longest word in the dictionary so hopefully there's some of you out there that I already know the answer to that\nHard events from this past week we did of course as I mentioned we had a volatile week we're going to talk about that in the next segment a but getting to Iran mosque of Tesla he had his fraud settlement with the SEC and that was approved by a judge so this was interesting as far as a Tesla there's concern\nUm the\nI guess as he sees approving the settlement that they came to the arrangement of the settlement now with that though are you must also came out this week and said he is wanting to buy twenty million dollars worth of stock usually when\nA someone announces that they've uh you they would announce it they've purchased stock not that they're going to purchase ... an unusual announcement and that's why many people feel that Iran mosque is probably not the right person to be head of test well he's a very creative and innovative individual obviously\nA and and should have a very ... you know roll a big role in Tesla but when it comes to actually being the front spokesperson for the company a lot are thinking he probably should not\nBe that person or I folk so I'm going to talk a little bit about Social Security in the upcoming uh next segment as well there's been some changes to Social Security and I also want to talk briefly about when it comes to planning\nFor those of you out there whether you're in the early stages of your financial career in other words maybe you just received a ... year first real good job you're out of college now and you\nHave that first position and now you're wondering\nWhat can I be doing to start putting money away for my future well I Would hope but I Know that many of us out there in our fifties or sixties or seventies if we had the chance to do things over again we probably would when it comes to our finances we would have done some things differently\nWhy because many people out there today are thinking well gee do I have enough\nTo retire or those who are already retired or thinking it would have been nice to have a little bit more possibly than I Do today and and they look back and they say well I could have done this I should have known that\nI shouldn't have done this\nAnd that's understandable but we are as individuals we have to go through life and we've got to make these mistakes that's how we learn\nAnd hopefully a we can also in part our piece of wisdom whatever that is whether that's in any industry that may be that we're in or or maybe whether it's the coaching\nA children whatever it may be in your whatever your passion is\nUm but we want to hopefully allow others to learn from our mistakes as well so when we talk about things on this show if you're a younger individual out there and you're just getting started in your career and starting to try to put money away for your future\n[noise] listen closely to the things that we talk about on this show and listen closely to your elders and your parents and your uncles and you're answering your grandparents and and older friends but you may have why because they've been through things ah that\nYou haven't experienced yet now I'm not saying that you will experience everything they have maybe where you want but\nHave you gone to a major financial crisis in this economy that we've seen back in two thousand and seven and eight how did that affect a certain people versus you who's just now getting started you probably didn't even\nUnderstand her realize what had happened back then so many people lost their their livelihoods they lost their jobs they lost their homes they lost investments they lost everything in some cases and had to start over again\nSo we would hope that you wouldn't make that type of mistake and how do you avoid that\nWell number one is is that we have to of course\nUnderstand whenever we're investing in anything out there we want to understand the risks and that was a big issue that was facing many people back in the last financial crisis right when that market collapsed as it did many people were overextended they had borrowed money\nOr to purchase a maybe a second or third home they took equity from their personal residents\nTo borrow that money to go by another piece of property or to invest it in some other area or to just buy toys with it possibly well hope but we wouldn't make that mistake again as we did see a recovery in the real estate market\nHopefully folks are allowing that equity to build up in their home so that at some point in the future\nYou'll be able to retire and not have a mortgage payment right that's a goal for many people and as it should be and ultimately that can really make a big difference in retirement when it um helps you to understand you don't have that mortgage payment\nOr in retirement and there's less uh expense that you have in order to cover those other important needs that you're going to have whether it's higher medical bills or\nOr maybe some additional vacation money you'll have in retirement so hard there's music got to take a short break right now folks when we come back from the break we're going to continue the conversation and talk a little bit about this week's volatile market as well as some strategies you could be using to secure some money during\nThese volatile to I'm trying to

quiet and you didn't really know anything about him but\nBut Bill Gates said out his guest dearest longest best friend that\nThat without Paul Allen we don't have the personal computer right now I Know people might argue well we had apple and Steve Jobs but in reality what we know of as the personal computer running Microsoft ... seats yeah the one that that one that actually paved the way for Apple to sell so many ... people were going to like\nWithout the competition between Microsoft and apple we'd probably are where we are now like that really drove drove acknowledging and innovation ages and making them smaller for double such such now that most kids in school have a laptop they work on keeping an eye or\nTheir their portable device for cell phone which are more than any PC ever did ... years back so\nBill Gates credits Paul Allen as the he's like the father of the of what we know as the personal computer right right because of the that operating system and because of their strategic relationship they had with IBM ... at the time which they just fell into 'em because of Bill Gates vision but that Paul Allen was the the architect\nDuring the show I Hope you can learn at least one important strategy that will improve your financial future also take advantage of our complementary retirement review please call her office of Grand Canyon planning it for eight or nine nine one ten fifty five for eight or nine nine one ten fifty five I look forward to meeting with you\nI'm John Dankosky reminding you don't run out of money before you run out of time now back to the show\nMhm Mm\nMhm mhm\n[noise]\nYeah All right we're back down to rescue the word I'm well jokes there's always going to have an email the Harvard when Washington sent me this email questions today or John ads in the word on well dot com that John Edward on wealth down into why that music was loud there wasn't for a group yes exclusion who I'm\nTalking with mark ... one of our advisors here at the farm again Grand Canyon planning and you have questions or concerns you'd like sit down and talk with one of our visor shared are from forty nine nine one ten fifty five is the phone number four Ito nine nine one ten fifty five\nMark I'm going to get to a couple of emails I always encourage folks to send us email questions to deal with the word I'm well that counts as dear John at the word I'm about that kind of want to get one of those emails right now and then when they get into a topic here mark that basically relate to this email and it says you're down this from Peter by the way to Peter thanks for this email here John\nI'm close to retirement and considering options for withdrawing from my investments once retired my question is\nShould I draw from my taxable accounts or should I withdraw from my non taxable accounts once I retire\nAnd I would I Would have added to that to Peter by the way or should I Do both a great question because that's something that we always want to understand right and that's what's important about taking into account taxes mark into a financial plan\nEven while you're building value of that financial plan and and growing that plan over the years we should be thinking about taxes long before\nThe distribution face which is where Peter is at this point thinking about retiring shortly or what have you ah talk a little bit to that mark and all that my two cents\nYeah let me know one of those things that are we always try to look at it like you mentioned\nWhat is the big picture look like and really trying to identify where we're going to get the biggest bang for our buck\nUm play on words bang for your but yeah and and and sometimes ah when you go to retire maybe you're retiring at sixty years of age but you don't plan to trigger a benefit such a Social Security 'til much later in in your uh later years maybe up to sixty five maybe up to Seventy before you turn on\nAnd maybe your income is going to be nonexistent until then and so maybe it would be more advantageous for Peter to\nTo withdraw funds from his retirement accounts to supplement or replace the income from his regular\nW to employment income if that's the type of um income he receives and use that now because maybe it's taxable income will be nonexistent exactly and so maybe he won't have such a tax burden now we're in the future we don't know where tax rates are going to be in of course when you start adding additional sources of income such as Social Security\nWhere maybe any pension income that you may be entitled to you know that could certainly change\nOr move the needle from a tax base and so we just want to sit down and look at all those moving parts and decide collectively which and maybe it will be a combination of both right ah but you know looking at those those those types of accounts and looking at and talking with the CPAs that are the folks work with\nTo make sure we're we're asking all those questions in deciding which is going to be the best avenue to go down\nYou know mark there's something called you know I mean there's all sorts of names you to put to it but bracket creep as it might be in other words uh currently the tax code has a number of different brackets tax brackets\nAnd depending on your income you fall within range in a bracket right so it's very possible that depending on where you're taking money from the um the tax\nA status of that money may create you to creep into the next tax brackets therefore paying a much higher rate of taxes so we want to understand\nThat and if you have the availability to pull money from a non taxable account or to an account that would be taxed at a lower rate maybe a capital gains rate rather than an ordinary income tax rate that might make the difference of saving thousands of dollars a year in taxes and and as you know I Do\nA lot of planning with veteran litter yeah you know in their seventies and eighties and a lot of times I deal with those that are still married and a lot of times when one is in in a care situation and the other one is just living independent healthy\nUm a lot of times we can do some planning around that where we can use right the expense of let's say the the the spouse in those cases in an assisted living type of arrangement ... I'm In large part a lot of that experience can be a tax deduction\nAgainst income and so in many cases is more advantageous to pull money is from a retirement account or has a lot of ... a lot of that money can be coming out\nAnd what the CPAs blessing of course a that money could be coming out relatively\nTax free right to look at all those options and see if we can't find ways to maximize those distributions here's a here's just a story that just occurred to with another client of mine had done our review every year folks you know we usually do a at a minimum a annual review with the client depending on what their financial situation is\nBut we we pull the client and and we're talking this week and of course in this particular case\nThe individual turned Seventy this year and will be Seventy and a half as of December ... now that means of course that this individual needs to take a what's called the required minimum distribution from their retirement accounts\nSo what we did is we did a quick analysis of the value of the portfolio and what that minimum required amount would be\nA and we understood what we had to take and we also understood that for for this year mark there's that little caviar for the first year that you would have a required distribution which is that you can take that require distribution in the year following\nThe actual uh require distribution is required right so in this case if that individual had to take the distribution of two thousand sixteen because it's the first one meaning just turned seven and a half they can push that out to next year\nHowever um we want to understand again what the tax ramifications are going to be this because I was talking to the individual still working age Seventy fantastic\nStill contributing to four one K. a healthy being able to do all that and then and I asked the questions are you planning on retiring what what's going on with your financial life what are you thinking here\nAnd he was saying maybe I might retire next year I said okay well if you're gonna retire next year that means you're going to give up that hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income that you're earning isn't that true and he said well yes I said well what if we waited to take that require distribution until next year\nBecause if you're not going to have that hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income well maybe we'll take that are empty that distribution and we're going to lower your tax a tax rate on that\nUh so that really made a big impact because his distribution was going to be about Fifteen thousand dollars\nSo the difference of maybe a Fifteen Percent tax bracket versus a twenty five percent tax bracket markets thousands of dollars and all that if he took it and this year he probably just put it in the bank because he wouldn't need it they need it he was he has exactly right he didn't need the money\nBut of course we were required to take it even though we don't need it now remember that folks that's critical and and here's a situation where he has a four O. one K. he still working still contributing to it and mark as you and I know if\nIf you still working in a participant in four one K. plenty even if you're Seventy and a half or Seventy two or Seventy five or eighty five if you're still participating in that plan you do not need to take required minimum distributions from the plant and again that was something he was not aware of\nUh so we were able to discuss that as well knowing that that was not going to need to be part of the calculation for the required minimal distribution\nYeah one of the things I like to to have a conversation about clients as it I mean you probably have a similar thing a lot of our clients are taking that money out of their retirement accounts like IRAs and all four one K. and such only because they have to mhm and they go well gosh I'm doing it because I'm they'll all be penalized otherwise I like to have those conversations where we can\nYou know if we're gonna have to do it anyway reallocate andme yeah maybe we don't take those monies and leverage that into something else where it's going to be more impactful\nTax wise in the future or maybe part of a legacy plan ... to maybe do some sort of planning with maybe use of life insurance if you're healthy enough to make sure we can leave tax free benefit dollars to the next generation of fire tea or whomever yeah um and that's a real a interesting conversation for a lot of folks out there so we love a love having that conversation\nNow you're talking to mark because right we're taking tax after tax dollars now\nAnd we're able to place those are ... or I should say before tax dollars when you contributed does now became taxable when you took the distribution but now re allocating those assets into a plan that ultimately would be tax free\nFor your beneficiaries whether that your spouse or whether that's your children your grandchildren are as you mentioned maybe a a charity of your choice\nOr so boy all sorts of options for folks but again until you sit down with an educated and\nExperienced financial advisor folks a lot of those things may not ever come to light for you so I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity to sit down and talk with us from\nGrand Canyon planning happy to do that sometimes we're a little busy and may have to wait a week or two to get in front of climate but that's OK\nYeah get ... get on the counter would love to sit down and talk with you to see what you're doing to plan for your financial future pay marketing Britain appreciate as always you being here mark my pleasure I'm trying to rescue the word I'm well folks as always here with you each and every week and we appreciate you listening to us ah hopefully find the information interesting and it also ah gets you thinking about maybe picking up\nFive or ten years of being retired this is a certain period of time where you've got to look at things entirely different turn your life upside down get new directions make sure the GPS is set for this stage of life\nRight and and there's so much more to retirement planning than just picking the right investment fill us I think you're right people they've been in the gay accumulation phase for so long they been focused on growing\nTheir nest egg and saving but there's more to it than just making the right stock picks are making the right decisions with your investment\nCan you talk about some of the strategies that we can use so we don't outlive our savings and you know strategies other than just growing growing growing in the stock market\nYeah absolutely I mean it's very appropriate when you have that paycheck coming in each week\nOr every two weeks over you get it and that's paying your bills and you're taking some of that and you're saving the amount that you're saving for the long term it's very appropriate to focus on hey let's go let's go let's grew it because if you don't need that money for the day to day think about it when you retired if all you do is grow\nThat money well if you need that money and it's down we got a crisis on our hands perhaps right\nMhm so we've got to develop a plan that first of all gets us that steady paycheck that we've had all along so we can maintain our lifestyle in retirement the first thing that's important is is cash flow cash flow cash is king in retirement how do we replace that paycheck\nHow do we make sure the inflation adjusted\nBecause you know you get raises while you're working or at least I Hope you do\nRight and that helps you keep up with inflation you don't even see that but how do we make sure that that you know we get that paycheck so\nWhen we look at retirement planning yeah it's far more than just making sure that you you've got the performance we've got to start with the basics and the basics or\nYou know what's the budget in retirement what the what are our goals and retirement\nWho comes in to see us as a different goals and retirement they're going to do different things some are going to have expensive hobby is someone gonna go visit the grandbabies and spent lots of money on\nThem so I'm not going to go all the time so I'm not really you know not going to spend all that much but probably\nMore than they do when they were working because they are more times on their hands to you have to figure out for yourself what does your retirement\nLook like and let's I Know the budget word in the journal ready but really it's not as daunting as you\nThink it's important to be proactive reacted let's lay that out as a first step and I will tell you it is so important because\nSo many people under estimate what they're going to spend in retirement they think that they're going to spend less than they did during their working years no two things will change where you spend your money on but think\nAbout it now while you're busy working\nGee you're so busy during the week that you don't spend that much and Saturday and Sunday you get to spend more\nRight right but ... but when you're retired every day is like the weekend so you might spend more\nYou have to say about that and and you know what I Do this every time we plan a trip or something and I'll come up with here's what I think this is going to cost and my husband and kind of look at me\nAnd he'll say well you didn't really factor and how much you're going to be spending on gas or you didn't think about this and it's it's so easy to just underestimate it and say yeah yeah they did to me but [laughter] yeah\nYeah I Do about this because you know we sit with people every day and enough first meeting we really have to get to know them we have to understand so someone says yeah I Want to travel in retirement as I stopped it that we could very well get their budget raw because what is travel look like to you\nVersus what it looks like to your friends you know some people want to get in an RV and travel that way that's a lot less expensive than someone who wants to stay in a five star hotel yeah so are you gonna do that out we got to get it right\nAnd we've got to be realistic with that number so that's the first step before you ever get what the products are what stark you need what do we need that money to do so budget what's it going to cost us then we want to look at you know how much guaranteed income\nDo we have coming in cash flow every month that we we can rely on Social Security Social Security is inflation adjusted this year we're actually going to see for the first time in a long time and inflationary bump\nAnd Social Security which is yeah um [noise] first time in a while that the you're actually going to the extra money in your pocket so we want to make the right decision on how you take your Social Security when you take it if you're married\nWere even more different claiming strategies\nYour signal but it's a big decision do I take it at sixty to do I take it at full retirement do I wait to seven days you know Social Security is not in tight tight on that you worked\nHard for it's not something they're giving to you so we want to Reno every single penny and it can be a reliable source of income and shouldn't be the only source but let's get it right so in our process we're going to analyze that\nIf you have a pension there's a lot of decisions to make their do you take the lump sum and manage it you know by yourself sometimes at work sometimes that's not appropriate you should leave it at the company and take a pay out which is nothing more than a new with it\nBut how do you take that lists lay that out but see the guaranteed cash flow that's going to come in for you if you even have a pension\nGet that right let's see that gap how much income out of the gate are you going to be you know behind here's what we need each month his ... coming in what's our deficit but understand that let's understand that because how do you build in England when what are your directions to get there if you don't know what you need\nAnd we have to factor for inflation inflation never sleeps I was just reading an article the other day\nIn Nineteen Seventy [laughter] gas\nWas thirty six cents [laughter]\nThirty thirty six cents and people complain that out [laughter] yeah yeah and look at how much of it is today we've got\nLow inflation so even when you know inflation never sleeps we've got to build an inflation adjusted income plan\nYou know another step in the process long before we get do what we should pick out her investments which sock we should do in the ... bond or should we have an annuity shouldn't we\nWe don't understand what the risks hard sometimes you know\nI meet people who could take a lot of risk because they've got great ... great Social Security they're not going to spend a lot but they would lose it if they if they were going to if they lost more than a certain they work hard it's the blood sweat and tears they shouldn't have a lot of risk other times I meet people\nWho think oh yeah yeah I can lose whatever until I show them\nThat if they lose whatever they're going to lose their lifestyle and retirement I was going to analyze their risk tolerance first\nThen we've got to understand how much risk they're actually taking an investment do an actual stress tests showed them we'll numbers show you real numbers about how much whiskey would be taking in a good marketing the bad market people worry about the bad market how it's going to affect them real numbers matter\nWe want to look at your investments and really be very transparent about all the fees that you know that you're paying that you know about some you know about some you don't know about so many people don't have a clue fees are actually paying the [noise] so we're going to look at that\nAn education to give you the real numbers this weekend so that you can make an informed decision am I getting the most bang for my book on these investment dollars Phillips understand the risks that you take it\nAnd you know it's one thing to make performance to make a great we turn on your money and it's another to understand how much you're actually keeping\nAnd what's insidious is you know once the taxation on this money so if I made ten percent this year and my making you know am I making a third of that are half of that for Uncle Sam room I actually keeping that timbers that\nOnce the taxation of the dollars you've accumulated if we don't look at a tax plan understand the tax consequences of your ... holy you to leave money on the table so we have to have a tax strategy we have to understand how much\nAre you in partnership with Uncle Sam on your portfolio and most people have pre tax retirement account and they've got a partnership with Uncle Sam\nOr a loan from Uncle Sam and they don't know the terms of it so we've got to identify that as we build the swim\nAlso got to understand future health care costs if there's a need for custodial care later in your life\nWhat's that going to cost you where would you get the money from um we got to have that laid out we've got to be proactive than reactive\nBecause especially if you're married what happens if you go if you need custodial care and\nYou have to take money out to pay that you don't have a win win the market's down you take it out of the market and then you have a surviving spouse who has less to live on let's be proactive about that not reactive let let's think about that up front before we build the plant\nAnd then we want to make sure we have the right of state documents so that your hard earned money goes to whom you want it to go to how you want it to go when you want it to go this is law retire fit analysis this is why you want to pick up the phone and be one of the first ten hall this week\nThe tenure treasures could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have a great chicken that retirees will be able to look out and go wow you know what that is pretty good I can I can live off of the income checks and so I think it is\nA retiree it can actually be a very\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Baake well known financial educator about the recent market drop I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] it's funny because nobody knows what I what what I Know and then we've\nBeen talking about it and making you know I've done other interviews on um I Know we're like we we just had the greatest marketer [noise] I I Know that if you've been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down it's just stayed the course today more wealth than you've ever\nAnd at the same standpoint the last few months I've been telling people don't get I don't know is not done now is not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money\nIf you're in your fifties markets pullback you can't afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you're tired [noise] your your comfort level with seeing your money drop significantly\nIs going to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you're approaching retirement order or you're already retired you talk with the financial work with a financial wise or if\nThat if you have a financial wise right now that you pick up the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do all your financial go back into their office sit down with them how they will walk you through what you're invested a lot of people who are retired that might be fearful the stock market today\nActually I have a very well we call very low exposure to talk like only people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and half of their money in an annuity paying them a guaranteed rate and half of their money in bonds and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so uh but they read the news and they're very secure\nSo don't be fearful find out find out how much money you actually have\nHow much risk are you taking and again or what your financial advisor on just a big believer that\nA a working with a professional for sure it which is what we recommend people\nRegistering best revised or when you work for the financial wise or the most important part is that they do a financial plan for you that they get they get to understand what your comfort level with the risk is and then they help you build an investment portfolio\nOn your goals and your comfort level with risk if you have a very low comfort level with any risk well then you should have less money in the market\nDavid fantastic insight on this market drop one silver lining here and all of this\n[noise] well I think the silver lining is how incredible when economy we have right now like let's not leave sight you know look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment in America in forty nine years\nUnemployment is at three point seven percent right now\nWhat is that why is that because we have an incredibly strong economy right now so GDP which you know two years ago nobody believes that Judy ... three well most people certainly GDP right now oh first half of the year ... point ... percent\nThere are projects showed the third quarter could be as high as four percent so the economy in the U.S super strong\nAnd things really are very very positive which is why by the way also we've had stock markets hitting\nAll time show just notice things Connie are strong this was a very long time to see a pull back in the market if anything is probably very healthy that we're seeing a pull back in the market right now and just notice the economy's\nDoing really well the tax cuts about a huge impact and for the foreseeable future we seen economy that's continuing to grow\nDavid Box
