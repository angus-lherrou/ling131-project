have endorsed my campaign including ten Democrats one of the reasons why the overwhelming majority elected sheriffs endorse my campaign is because many of those shares I worked with hand in hand after\nHarvey and the Senate I helped lead the effort to pass\nThree major disaster relief bills working hand in hand with John Cornyn where we improved and expanded those disaster relief bills and emergency tax relief in his referenced was legislation that I authored I officer to introduce passed into law did it jointly with John Cornyn markets\nThe the crust Cornyn Rubio emergency tax relief

not President Trump here's some more Ted Cruz your last night\nBut you know it's striking that the congressman O'Rourke didn't dispute extreme record on abortion supporting late term abortions

don't agree on this one\nHas to do with something in the culture to culture pieces of to culture stories I Want to share with you I watch the counters last night the reason I watched it because I'm a lot of people didn't watch it I don't know if the ratings are out yet last can you check the overnight and see what the news is about ABC's re boot of the Roseanne show\nUh they they fired her for her tweet about Valerie Jarrett\nI wasn't going to watch and then I read somewhere that she didn't want anything bad to happen to the show because she wanted her friends and the people she worked with for many years to be okay so it wasn't like Roseanne herself was calling for any kind of a boycott of the show and I was interested to see how it how it was and actually it\nWas very good it was Roseanne without Roseanne but it was the same vibe it was it was really a good good episode\nAnd it dealt with the fictional deaths of Roseanne Connors the character died of an opioid overdose or she died of a prescription medication overdose which is a very real\nStory line for many people in this great country of ours\nAnd I happened to be a big fan of Laurie Metcalf the character actress who plays your sister Jackie\nDay encounters a played by John Goodman I I think he's a tremendous character actor and they put they put out very very powerful performances and you know we're going to see how it plays out\nUh again I watched it only because I didn't think that it was um something that she she wanted to show to to succeed even though she's obviously very upset\nAbout being fired and for good cause\nOne tweet have you heard Bill Maher lately have you seen Chelsea Handler lately what about Cathy Griffin you go down the list of people who say the most horrific things about conservatives
