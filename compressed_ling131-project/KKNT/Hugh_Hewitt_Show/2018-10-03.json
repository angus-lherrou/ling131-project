welcome it's great to talk to the morning here are you supporting judge Kavanaugh\nA hundred percent this is a total sham Hugh you wrote about it earlier this week this is a version back McCarthyism by the Democrats I mean it is outrageous the character assassination the\nDemocrats are burning a very bedrock of our democracy and that is the presumption of innocence and this and this character assassination is the the new low in my time here in Washington it's just unbelievable you\nKnow your colleagues center and told me earlier today the absence corroborating evidence of Dr Ford's testimony specifically she will be a yes vote the belief that the one Republicans will have that same standard apps and corroborating evidence of Dr forged testimony\nI Do you I Believe that are we doing everything we can from a Chuck Grassley the chairman of the judiciary all the way down to this latest FBI investigation we've done everything they've asked for there's absolutely no corroborating out as a matter of fact the Democrats\nSay well this is just a he said she said and we have to decide who's telling the truth no it's more than that because she brought cooperating witnesses story who could not cooperate her story but they did actually cooperate his story so I Believe that we will get fifty one votes later this week\nNow there are also troubles with her testimony and the president brought them up last night and he's been criticized that\nI got to tell you in the first time today show\nAnd I do this for the benefit of the audience you're just tuning

caller to the show all women cannot up ten one cabinet confirmed nine out of ten applied what the president did last night and yet the blue bubble media is attacking him for doing it what do you think senator produce\nYou know you I travel my state a lot in the last couple of weeks and I hear from women all over they know that said wrought founding principles of our founding mothers and fathers are sacrosanct and this presumption of innocence cannot be waved around all the way the Democrats are doing it right now this is an absolute travesty\nFor the American justice system or I Can't wait to get him confirmed that the Democrats are the ones that are conducting a wall women by the way to the person that's been abused in this whole process to the doctor for the Democrats\nPromised to not reveal this this could have done been done confidential you which is what she wanted instead\nSomeone up here either in the Congress ones will Congress woman's office on senator Feinstein's office somebody leak that letter and now after that game public is just outrageous and by the way that shut three weeks after dying Feinstein head this letter she had her personal interview with judge\nKavanaugh she didn't mention it at all there was a one word of conversation about the letter when she met with him probably the first time\nHe also has been abused and I believe I've been thinking about this a lot 'cause I've never seen this kind of a reaction I didn't know radio since Nineteen Ninety [noise] is that\nA ten year old daughter and a fourteen year old daughter are going to be hearing about this from friends and photos and cheap shots for the rest of their lives and they're going to hear their father accused of being a gang rape is they're going to hear their father accused of being a drug and it's all without any kind of precedent\nAnd I think Americans are revolting by that center ... do\nYou this is what's going on let me let me give you some quotes of the Democrats\nMy wife was physically accosted this week at the airport here in Washington I was physically accosted by members of the center of public democracy you know these people are funded by the

not appear not to people who know the facts I mean we've looked at the testimony we've heard all the witnesses I mean this is an absolute zero case there is not act a district attorney in the world

two women first time caller just talked to capping Scranton and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa and in Detroit or as a teenage son\nNorma in Michigan Alexander in Newport Beach California a lame in Louisville\nJeannie in Oregon showing in Columbus and in San Diego offer some colors all of them are what Kavanaugh's confirmed nine out of ten of them support what the president said last night one wish they hadn't set it and they all\nDo believe Dr ... testimony though they are all very sympathetic and indeed one as a daughter who's ... survivor of sexual assault [noise] that's\nJust a slice of what I've been hearing what have you been hearing\nWell I Am hearing of\nCourse a mixture of that cause I get to the office a lot of them are are saying\nGet Kavanaugh confirmed and then there are others that um are you know adamantly oppose way the those folks on the TV all the time [noise] um but what I Do hear when I'm Out and about and people just can't understand um why we haven't moved on with that and getting him confirmed\nThey understand that he has that right to um credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and they finally expect that we should get this done sat down\nWithout a center as I Do not believe the president was mocking the idea of someone being assaulted last night he was poking\nHoles and testimony and I want to reveal a few things with you about the testimony first of all there was a story in Politico that she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be the way she never actually said that herself but that was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former\nBoyfriend has filed a letter saying she's familiar with polygraph said never discuss sexual assault there they knew real clear investigations report that the second\nFront door contractor evidence shows it was not about claustrophobia but at second entrance for an office there wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the Rachel Mitchell Report I simply do not believe that that testimony could knock Brett Kavanaugh folk consideration\nNo I'd I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I'd do honestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point so do I sure do I I I think most folks want to agree with that however um that even the witnesses that she called forward\nActually at camp corroborate or simply tear down that that testimony that she gave about um some party that she had attended cell unfortunately um for for her I don't\nFind that to be a credible message and again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think she experienced trauma that I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught me they're telling the fourteen year old\nThey will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people have not stood up to a to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is that none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse is allegation\nWas libel and slander ascend immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge cabin on your view\nWell I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course you won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um by we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put through um\nThe worst possible situation ever with\nTheir father being demeaned and end is credited and and that's very unfortunate and we have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up be nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office if it simply takes an accusation and unproven accusations\nWhich can put a family and literally how\nDuring the Adler who would be the chairman of how to Sherry if the Democrats take the house that's a very scary thought here said he is going to open impeachment hearings based upon the judges perjury nothing he said I'm I've been doing it for thirty five years remotely approaches perjury as a lawyer and not that they're not a single on\nVerifiable assertion that he made he characterizes drinking he did not\nDenies drinking why would anyone take that seriously\nWell just look around here it's all about obstruction at about resistance and as about what can we stop and put it in the president's way what can we put in Congress his way\nTo stop them from doing a better job for the United states of America\nI mean look at our economy and how strongly are doing right now and and now thanks to our counterparts across the aisle they have tried to slow it down stop at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it as as stopping the tax cuts and job to act what ever it is\nThey try and LA LA resist um and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house\nWe can expect that for the next two years\nNow I've been calling this frequently on line the new McCarthyism because McCarthyism as the taking of a very serious charge that's been proven in other contexts in that case originally treasonous conduct against the Rosenberg perjury by his and assigning it to the Hollywood screenwriters that's McCarthyism\nThis McCarthyism is taking people like ... a Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and they're horrible crimes and attributing them\nTo a bread cabinet and I think people need to stand up and say this is hysterical and it's deeply unfair senator\nAsset is absolutely unfair and it is absolutely ridiculous if you look around the Senate you can point fingers here too and members that had added admittedly I'm had bad behavior and they're in their past which probably surpasses any action\nStation that has been\nLeveled against Brett Kavanaugh so I think people should tread very lightly on the things that they are throwing at this respectable man and his family\nThey don't want it to come around five fold against them in the future so um we just need to do a better job here in the United states had teaching our children what is appropriate behavior what is not appropriate behavior and then of course I'm\nJust doing better as society but for other members to kind of laugh about what they did in their college days and then I point the finger at Brett Kavanaugh and say you are not qualified to serve on our nation's highest court because you drank beer and high school or college you know shame on you\nThey had better start thinking twice about what they're doing\nYou know a Jeff Flake who I have campaigned within four and I believe to be a fair and decent man he actually had good faith and the Democrats who's been proven wrong of course I did not use this to wait for the FBI report they immediately moved the goalposts\nHave you got any sense when the FBI is going to finish and therefore a motion for cloture filed do have a timetable\nI Do think that we will say that this week I think the FBI as probably winding down as as we are speaking out with their witnesses and I know it at our leader as very intent on getting a voted on this week\nSo as soon as we can receive the report I Do think it is important to a\nReview the information and that report for the supplemental investigation um we need to know that for our constituents just be able to verify you know everything is okay if everything does check out then we move forward and and have that same wrapped up but I Would anticipate um as a leader and state and he wants to see it down this way\nHave you heard any I've heard that possibly be FBI report will be done today and culture filed tonight have you heard that\nUh I have heard some semblance have that to buy 'em again I I Would hesitate to say that on on a national program I think that we have to make sure that we are going through the report that we've had time to and so our but next year that we're able to\nPush back to our our constituents that everything has got to go and then we move forward do\nYou expect at this point at this point obviously with a report to review that you will be voting for judge Kavanaugh\nI well I'm unless they're an something that surfaces and they are and the investigative report that you know the supplemental report that would cooperate Dr forwards testimony unless that happens I plan to support judge Kavanaugh\nSay cutting number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats their toes over all of all of them\nThan anybody I Know the only or open seemingly ... even though they're toasted they don't know they should\nPresident Trump one day say promising to nominate conservative judges
