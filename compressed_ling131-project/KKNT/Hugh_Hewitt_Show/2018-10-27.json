{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "Taxes are on our minds taxes have been in the news and that is our fourth landmine because understanding how to be tax efficient maybe one of the most impactful things you do in accomplishing your financial goals and I think you know we're all United in our dislike of taxes\nFact according to the Tax Foundation sometime over the first couple of weeks of April is really what we call your tax freedom day mean that every dollar you earn the\nFirst three and a half months or so of the year goes for you to pay taxes here's another way to put it nearly one third of our time at work every day is spent simply to work to pay our taxes because besides federal tax there is also state tax local tax capital gains tax state tax sales tax property tax\nMust face it we're getting hit from taxes all over the place and sometimes we lose sight of the fact that it's not what we\nBut it's rather what we actually keep\nThe matters you know taxes are a natural part of our life\nYet the tax efficiency of your portfolio critically important\nAnd we know we must pay our fair share right and who can really know what that amount is to be honest but there are specific strategy surrounding taxes that can significantly impact your ability retire and retire well and when applied directly these tax strategies a future planning and being proactive\nMay have a bigger impact on your success of your financial freedom than the underlying investment performance itself that we tend to spend so much time fix setting in studying and evaluating sadly most people have failed to do any sort of proactive tax plan you know what am I talking to but I mean just think about your situation right now\nMany of you listening work with financial advisors you have CPAs maybe you use TurboTax maybe you invest on your own but I mean I think there was this\nWhen during the middle of the summer have you received a phone call\nFrom your CPA not related to filing your taxes just out of the blue that says\nHey Joe was looking at your situation when can you come in to discuss how to reduce your taxes I have some ideas not just for this year\nBut how to reduce taxes over the next ten Fifteen or Twenty years I mean if you're like most folks you've never had that call and most of the financial advisors are more interested in selling you variable annuity or a non traded refund actually talking to you about how to reduce taxes you see that's the problem and very few or even experts in tax what's their background of tax\nWhat's their level of competency related to taxes to see tax planning requires foresight it requires more than just saying what can I Do this year to reduce my taxes\nThis year if you have questions about anything you here today you can call us twenty four hours a day seven days a week a one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine again the number one eight hundred seven six seven\nFifteen fifty nine to schedule your one page retire map review and when you call in to schedule your one page retirement that preview here's what you can expect\nA member of my team will schedule a ten minute call for one of our financial advisors to call you back you'll be able to share with us your concerns some of your goal some of the things that are on your mind and will in turn tell you how we think we can help\nAnd if it makes sense for both parties moving forward we will schedule your first visit with us at one of our offices either in Chandler Scottsdale to get your complimentary tailored customized one page retirement map review that you've heard me talk so much about on the show again that number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nDo you have a tax plan like do you know what you're doing the next Twenty years you know what you're doing it too doesn't it Eighteen\nTo prepare for two thousand and thirty and do you know what the current tax environment is today relative to what you're likely to be in Twenty years from now\nI find that very few people are leaving the gate and the terminal with any sort of plan of how they're going to land in Houston related their taxes whatsoever\nYou know and I think we see this in our kids I mean for those that have kids or grandkids how far in advance does a three year old think that's part of the maturity of a toddler they think about the thing that's going to happen next maybe they think about a Disney trip but the week in advance but usually it's just what is my snack right now\nCan we go to the park today\nIt's not wow you know the compound interest I could get on the investment account if I started saving will be phenomenal we don't think that way part of us maturing is that we start thinking more through the consequences and the impact of what we do today on the future and unfortunately we live within a society that we all recognize\nReally promotes instant gratification and with our taxes that means just stuff as much money for it is possible and reduce my taxes this year\nAnd so I Want to encourage you if we know that one of our primary landmines to accomplish in our goals is gonna be taxes\nI mean really simple to take away from the podcast is who's helping you\nCreate a phishing attack strategies if you're making right now here's a real practical way to think about if you are making if you're married and you're earning under three hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars a year of adjusted gross income you should not even for one second considered differing taxes\nWith the new tax reform you're in a twenty four percent tax bracket\nPrevious to this two dozen Seventy you would have had to make less than Seventy five thousand dollars to get under the twenty five percent bracket\nThe only way you would have gotten below the twenty five percent bracket is if you earn Seventy four thousand dollars or less so if you're listening and you even make three hundred grand a year like John I'm doing really well\nYou're in a twenty four percent bracket why are you different taxes I get it you make too much to contribute to a rough irate but most likely if you're in a big company\nOr you're not very often to set it up yourself why are you not funny in the ... section of your four one K. why are you putting Eighteen five away that the ghost and never tax ever again for the rest of your life\nWill genetic I'm gonna have to be twenty four percent tax on the Eighteen five and if I put it into for it I don't have to pay that correct\nBut you would have never paid less than twenty four percent in any conceivable scenario ever again for the rest of your life so why would you asked to pay it later and they have to pay thirty five or forty at some other point in the future\nAnd right now our current tax structure is set to sunset and twenty twenty five\nNow there's no certainty obviously things can change if in a few years a Democrat gets elected this'll be one of the first things they go after so who knows how long this opportunity is available but I Want to make sure you understand you need to have a tax strategy in reducing taxes today is not the answer for most of you\nIf you're making over three hundred and Fifteen thousand now you're up in a thirty two percent bracket maybe you have a little more question on that\nI Would argue that that person should still be putting money in most cases depending on the situation in tax free accounts part of us maturing is that we start thinking more through the consequences and the impact of what we do today on the future and unfortunately we live within a society that we all recognize\nReally promotes instant gratification and with our taxes that means just stuff as much money for it is possible and reduce my taxes this year\nAnd so I Want to encourage you if we know that one of our primary landmines to accomplishing our goals is gonna be taxes I mean really simple to take away his who's helping you create a phishing attack strategies\nYou really tax laws are constantly changing so you need to consider working with a team that monitors this changing landscape end its monetary your

in their best interest so they can make their bonuses they're not even looking at your tax situation and if you're near and dear to retirement I Can't emphasize enough\nYour tax strategy maybe as

looking at a thirty five foot\nToy hall or or travel trailer now will makes me crazy and I do I hate him\nIt makes me nuts even when I'm watching going down the road an s four fifty ... super duty duly long wheel base with a toy hall are hooked up behind it or a travel trailer hooked up behind it\nAnd it looks like a Volkswagen in front of this monstrosity now what really makes me crazy is when you look at them sometimes and the bats bumper on the vehicle is now six inches off the ground because to wait on the tongue or the weight in the goose neck is there\nOne thing that Dana and I don't do is we don't help people make poor decisions never we don't help people do something that's unsafe game we all night on how people by five thousand an under cars yet now when someone is buying a trailer now\nDodge ram does a wonderful job talking about the largest pale payload and telling capacity and a one ton pickup truck is only one way to get it though how to get a nice an automatic transmission and it increases the payload telling capacity twelve thousand pounds I Believe it goes from Eighteen to thirty\nNow the other thing you have to look at when you're buying these vehicles is\nOne of the differential\nRational racial actual ratios came\nThese are things that when someone asks me those questions that there are times that's when I sometimes defer\nTo the salesman because I can look at an actual ratio and I know that uh for Lebanon apology rear end in our truck or something over force you're going to talk more but you're gonna get worse fuel economy\nGame when you're looking at a card game limited slip differential posse traction rear end the vehicle has is the vehicle has that we understand these things but I got to tell you the cars are becoming so technologically advanced\nThat there's no possible way that we can know everything about all the cars but when we go to the dealership I primarily try to deal with the sales person that is a professional\nAnd does understand the the vehicle that they're selling now the most important thing and you may not like to do this you may not want to do it but if you buy one of these cars and it's got blind spot monitors and it's got crushed traffic\nAnd it's got a parking sensors and it has a navigation system it has this and that has that ... to yourself\nAnd I only know one person that did it\nRead the owner's manual Kate my wife bought a truck and the next morning I went outside and she was sitting in the driveway she had two cups of coffee unfortunately a pack of cigarettes when she was reading\nThe owner's manual and I jokingly say she can if they don't know something at the dealership call my wife now I was at the dealership one day helping somebody by a car\nAnd I told the sales manager that worked in a dodge ram Chrysler dealership for Thirteen Years that my wife got a text message this morning that the tire pressure was loaned her tires\nAnd he looks to me and says car doesn't do that\nTo not only did she get a text message she got an email\nTo not only that you get the email she forwarded email to my friend she followed the text message to my friend and not only did it say what the tire pressures war but what was the closest dealership to bring the vehicle to it is unbelievable now I don't know about the you know\nI'm not a techie I'm not attacking my car has navigation I Do use it every once in a while I don't cook my phone up to the Bluetooth don't stream music through my treat is one I every once in a while to get the free ... satellite radio no I'll turn on a station at all actually working will be a free trial\nBut folks these cars are so so\nTechnologically advanced and it's\nYou know one of these things out when you're sitting there and you're in the finance office\nAnd they're trying to sell you a service contract extended warranty is what people think of service contractors wouldn't technically it and it shouldn't be called an insurance policy absolutely should be called that because\nThe other self insure or you buy an insurance policy now if a car's got a backup camera and it's part of the navigation system and that system goes to put out out now I bought a certified BMW\nIn two thousand and four or five and it was a I called it was half price sale I bought the car two years old\nTwenty thousand miles was half the price of a new one\n[noise] so [noise] I go to take delivery the vehicle and the salesman system hey you need to come back tomorrow to have the desk installed in the navigation system\nOkay now this was back in the day when it was this not satellite so I go back to the next morning and the guy comes out at the desk and he's all smiles and he puts the disk in there and going in the car I start the car during the system on no desk\nShe takes it outputs are back in no desk goes and gets another one same thing gets a third one same thing on the fourth one I kind of looked at him and I kind of chuckled and I said let me ask you a question now they finally figured out\nAfter me being in the dealership for Fifteen minutes a day before I bought a car now I left and they called me eight hours later and they got within five hundred bucks what I wanted to do we were fourteen thousand dollars apart when we left I got Thirteen five and the fourteen I had to give the last five hundred they got to give something by the way we we\nKnow how to buy a car to promise you [noise] so the funny thing was I finally looked at the salesman simply because they took me over the service drive\nAnd the service directors outside of going to ask a question [noise] do you think it might have something to do with the disc reader and not the desk as to why this navigation systems are coming on and he started to laugh now I knew enough about the car business that it was really simple\nThey could have fixed that vehicle when they certified it\nAnd it would have been done under warranty however since I bought the car\nThey were fixing it it was now done under customer pay warranty and Dana nose is a whole lot better than I Do\nWhen a vehicles in the service department they found some times about warranty repairs but they're never going to say a word when and they keep track of it the ... I Believe it to separate lying on a statement\nIt's paid him aren't you all the vehicles by the dealer and what was paid customer pay now the current needed in New internal ... those are three [noise] the car needed a new computer was forty seven hundred dollar repair\nNow they put me in a car and I had my car back later that day but did they not know that was bad when I bought the car but here's a funny thing and we all learn okay\nThis is what I've had experiences with car facts that makes me not trusted or like it I bought that car as a pre owns certified vehicle\nAnd they made the mistake I made the mistake of looking at the car facts as to when the vehicles sold [noise] there was only one problem\nThe first five thousand miles of the vehicle that was a general manager his wife's demos so you had an in service dates six months earlier correct so when I got to the end and I had the ... year hundred thousand mile warranty and I took the car and for parents\nThey explained to me you're a past time here past time I said no according to the car facts and we don't warranty cars according to car facts we weren't the cars according to BMWs\nWarranty warranted in computer so folks when you're signing a car facts\nIn a car dealership you're now urging very simply at the dealerships not responsible for any information report it to ... or more important not reported\nTo class and that's the part where the car tags that so many people\nTend are seem to have confidence and and again Gary and I will run car faxes on on cars just to make sure that nothing shows a bad there because obviously if it's there you can be sure it happened\nThe key is being able to look at a used car and be able to see if it's been in an accident see if it's been re painted see if body work's been done\nNot just rely on a report and if you're not capable of doing that yourself I'd be seed Gary and I are here to help six oh two five to five\nThirteen Seventy is Gary's number six to six seven nine eight three to four is my number but if you don't call us the health field and obviously and more importantly if you do it on your own please if you're not an expert\nPlease habit inspected by someone who is\n... and here's an important thing if you go and buy a car and you listen to the radio show and\nSpending money is not a bad thing if you're spending money for something that you want and you're not spending more than you should [noise] and so many people\nGet caught up in the the the moment and end up making decisions that [noise] like Gary referenced where they hurt our show before they hurt us\nWhat we do and then they go out and buy a car in any way of thinking that they've heard enough to to protect themselves without us and then you know whether it's a couple of days later a few days later they are now calling us saying hey\nWe we screwed up and will you help us out well you know again it's a shame on that person for not having the common sense to contact us in the first place\nAnd now we're going to try to go to send their their decision that that ultimately they made without our guidance and get involved in a debate with a dealership\nAnd it's just not fair to so we're\nHere to provide a service like no other Gary's number six oh two five to five one three seven zero I'll repeat that too I really want you to have the numbers you can call it six or up to\nFive to five one three seven zero or you can reach me day nine and six to six seven nine eight three to four we don't cost anything we do collect the four hundred dollars the\nAt the end of the transaction when our client is thrilled but it comes out of what we said to them and in almost every case\nThat not only do we see them of course money but we saved in time and we also guide them\nAnd protect them from making a mistake that would hurt them we don't let people go seven years to buy a car because that's all they can afford a swimming that does that to you is not helping you they're hurting you\nYou know and and it's funny because if you go to the\nArizona attorney general's website and I'm not trying to pick a fight with the attorney general's office they do do a lot of great things to help people but when they talk about a settlement between the attorney general in a car dealership and the amount of the settlements are a hundred and thirty thousand dollars gets a job that's pennies that's pennies it's about sometimes too much advertising\nBudget at a larger it'd be a one month it would be less than a month's advertising budget in a big dealership a hundred and thirty thousand dollars now\nAnd it was\nJust trying to read it divided and it's a catch twenty two for them because of all the revenue that's generated by car dealerships you know it'd be a catcher's why when you watch the news and you go to free on your side of me ever seen three on your side go after a large car dealership no have you ever seen\nIt it's unfortunate how it works and what we try to do is help you buy a car we protect you were not there to\nLine their pockets of the car dealers sharing there to protect you know pocket I had a gentleman a car dealership a couple of months ago general sales manager said to me you know if we make a little more money if you let us make more money will pay you a it's a job is not what we do\nWhen someone pays us it's four hundred dollars to

[noise]\nI guess the key says we hope to get across to the the publicity is learn those of you out there that\nIf if you would like and enjoy\nPurchasing a car and going through the buying process yourself and and feel that you're more than qualified to do it yourself whether you're right or wrong [noise] you need to just go ahead and do that we're here to help people that are smart enough to understand that there's a mismatch\nThe people that are coming in to buy cars that do it [noise] is rarely as they do are playing low level checkers against high level chess and virtually every scenario and unfortunately people\nSometimes rely on the information they gather whether it be from the Internet whether it be from you know advertising however way they end up getting there and they'll typically focus on one thing and it's usually the price price price price price and\nUnfortunately of course you don't really find out the real price of the car until after you're at the dealership and then after they presented the figures that shows the actual price they're going to ask [laughter] which is at least in my experience never actual advertised price\nIt's a higher number not learned case there was confusion so ultimately\nFor us we want to help people understand that when they you know having a really really good credit where they can get the best rate in the best terms and then we guide the structure that way\nWhen someone is in a circumstance where they have particular needs because of the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of transactions and deals that we've been involved with over the last thirty plus years [noise]\n... it's not that we've seen everything we we learn every day\nBut we've seen so much and and understand so much you you can't be the general manager and managing partner but dealership as I was for close to ten years and and not have a real full understanding of cardio [noise] um [noise]\nIn other words and let me set themselves who you've probably understand what are you saying\nYou're hired in part of your final indoctrination at this particular dealership is you had to upfront provide a list of the hottest prospects which would be friends family people you knew that we're going to be the first people you're going to call to try to get in to sell a card this young man\nGets his sister to come into the dealership\nAs I say right absolutely perfect oh she says she's driving the car and she has a car and she was back then sixty monthly says we're pretty prevalent\nHorrible and the car was involved in an accident in a few months afterwards or was total or stolen whenever it was and she needed another car\nAnd the sales manager was the same salesman just says same brothers same salesman same sister same car all the same usual suspects who knows how to sew the sales manager doesn't think and tells the kid to go upstairs to accounting and bring the deal down\nTo the kid goes upstairs comes down accounting and now he's an expert in the car business so he opens up the deal and the first thing that he comes out is his wash out which is his commission voucher and he sees on the commission voucher how much the gross was\nAnd then it said friends and family flat one hundred dollars so he got paid one hundred dollars and the gross on the deal was almost seven thousand dollars when he came downstairs the sad part was he was not mad\nAbout the dealership doing that to his family member he was upset about the dealership not paying him now when I mentioned I left for years\nI worked on ABC Nissan from Nineteen eighty eight to ... some ... part of Nineteen eighty nine was about seven months I got into a disagreement with the gentleman that happened to me the general manager and it wasn't really a disagreement he said something and I made a statement [noise]\nAnd he made the mistake of saying out loud to a dear friend of mine that I'm Still friends with Thirty years later Gary Green will never quit over this he is too broad of a future in the car business and I walked in the next day in my\nJeans and sneakers and handed him the dealer plate and I explained to him that I Do have a bright career in the car business but it's not working for you you wanna\nYou want me to do this you want me to pay this back to the dealership for doing my job meanwhile your rule warning\nTo salesman that are ...\nCriminal activity and your dealership well the funny part about it was four years I still refer business to the dealership and I got paid my bird dogs and one day a friend of mine was a sales manager was sitting there with that GM and the men that on the dealership and they said he share right now he'll write you a check\nTo come back to work right now how much do you need\nTwo months while you're making three months while you're making or we don't want you to worry and I looked inside as long as that gentleman the general manager I Will work than now I became friends with that general manager years later and he forgot what had happened\nAnd I reminded him he did so many things right and it's easy for him to free zone I reminded him one day when it happened when we were talking\nAnd the crazy thing was the gentleman that was the sales manager became the general manager when that general manager got what we call owner I'd us\nAnd he left a very good paying job\nAt the largest Nissan dealerships in the country and when it opened up three dealerships on his own in Nebraska in Kansas and lost his shirt but the point that I'm trying to make is be careful when you say out loud I Know somebody\nIf you take somebody to help you buy a car\nAnd they don't understand how the cardio works side could they cost you a lot of money and not only that last you a great deal of blind leading the blind first of all because if a doesn't understand how it works how was a ... explained it to be and the other part is is\nWe don't cost you anything if we meet with the dealership and you don't buy a car I jokingly said people sometimes if they don't ever trade I'll pick them up and take them to the dealership\nAnd one time a customer actually said to me well how will I get home if I don't buy the car I think your bag I tell take you home what kind of person do you think we are now don't usually get me wrong I don't get me wrong you treat us poorly\nWe can treat you justice and the we want you to pray will\nJust stop skews ourselves you know I had a gentleman one day and it was a good thing I didn't know where I live 'cause she got me so hot that\nI call them and finally said you know what I'm going to leave you alone because you get you'll get what's coming to you at some other point in your life this guy these people ruined it for the nice people I no longer get payments are prices or anything before I'd go someplace\nAnd when I explain to people is I'm willing to risk my time\nI Would be glad to meet you to a dealership your expertise your knowledge your gas if you don't buy the car no harm no foul but I'm not going to look for the car before we go because if the dealership doesn't have one\nAnd you're there by yourself you're going to have to fight tooth and nail to not buy something that they have\nAnd actually get what you want\nOr I can say to my friend they'll buy the car if you can find this if you can get that and they'll run like I said they did it on a Saturday afternoon for me last week\nThey traded for Ford Explorer on a Saturday afternoon game now dealer trades on the weekend aren't the easiest thing to get accomplished and the only time they normally work is when the dealership you're calling me something you have\nWell and and more often than not it's it's just because it's\nIt's the busiest day of the week accounting is not open there's nobody to cut checks and it's it's just as far more difficult task to do the other trades and then having staffing to get the cars a combination of things as it relates to if you're in the market to buy a newer used vehicle\nYou either can have the peace of mind knowing that Gary or myself either not cost you a penny\nAnd just give you free advice or or actually meet you and\nEither help you and still not charge you a penny I'm not sure thrilled and then if we help you we'll see how we saved you far more than our small fee and then you have played pay us our four hundred Darcy at the end\nEverything counts to us we we don't miss anything we care about the rate we care about the trade we care about the price we care about everything that could possibly affect you we don't care so much about what the dealer needs I\nPromise you we care about what you what she in your best interest not funny thing and it's not so much a funny thing but when we help somebody by a car it's exactly what it is or helping you buy a vehicle we're not selling you anything we're not doing things like that but [noise]\nThe when when when we\nGo some place we go because of one simple reason the dealerships know what it is we're there to accomplish and only the finance managers typically get stink guy when they see us because you know it it's called a sharp stick in the eye\nBut you know\nThe things that you read on line okay just because they're online is Dana would say just because it's not on the Internet doesn't mean is necessarily true [noise]\nI don't\nIt bothers me it bothers me when I see cars advertise that the dealership has no intention one way shape or form selling in the car gate when they advertise a car that you need to have certain\nAlignment of the stars in the sky to receive every rebate that's applicable\nNow they they have rebates that are stacked doubled then they'll have rebates that you have to give up if you want to buy the car and get some of the interest rate now\nWe understand all these things\nAnd when we show people not only the best price they can get but the best way to pay for a car [laughter] you know I had a young lady you know and I know pat real wealth super super bright more money than I'll never know what to do with my life and she wanted zero percent on a Cadillac\nWell the amount of rebates that she had to give up with her great credit and the down payment if she financed the car she was going to have the payment that was exactly the same as a zero percent financing somebody grand less [laughter]\nNow if you have a zero percent alone and you pay extra money every month towards your principal you're not saving anything other than\nBut it's also going to talk about some things that are upcoming like last week would've talked about well earnings report\nAre reporting is happening you know coming up and that's been happening this past week as we saw a substantial amount of companies reporting and we've got some good earnings out their folks so\nAnd we had all this volatility we we just it's it's a an anomaly here right we've got companies that are reporting great earnings we've got good for cash from the a conference calls from these reports\nUh and yet the markets were having some real challenges it was it was breaking down and we'll talk a little bit about that also though when you go to the website right on the front pages that website there is a little entry or introductory video that I encourage folks to\nTake a look at give you a little insight as to who we are as a financial planning from\nSome of the services that we provide and just\nSome are good information or on the website when it comes to upcoming workshops and other types of information that can help you plan to be successful in retirement\nOr one of the things are also on the economic update and the weekly communication that you'll get from us talks a little bit about weekly tips are rentals that we have each week just for fun some upcoming events\nAnd I'm One of the things is what's the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of autumn and fall and if you thought pumpkins and hopefully you celebrated pumpkin day\nWhich was on friday October twenty six just yesterday\nA not only are pumpkins delicious you know we had uh my wife Tracey brought in some pumpkin muffins for everybody\nAnd that was on Thursday we all enjoy those\nUm but pumpkins are out one of the main symbols of Halloween right because we've got Halloween right around the corner as well\nUh coming up on Wednesday or some fun facts about pumpkins the largest pumpkin in the world weighed in about one thousand one hundred and forty pounds wow can you imagine that\nEleven hundred and forty pounds a pumpkin how many pies do you think that would have made I Wonder if that pumpkin or would taste as good right a lot of times the larger\nA pumpkin I Wonder if it would have the same flavor as maybe some of the medium to smaller size pumpkins anyway I don't know I'm not I'm not necessarily be big pumpkin pie kind of a guy but ah I Know a lot of people do like pumpkin pie but you put a little ah whipped cream on anything or ice cream and it tastes good [laughter]\nAll right um you know one of the things we talk about uh each week is a weak little weekly tipped just out there and and and it's interesting because if you think about small business owners I come across this a lot with a small business owners as your business grows\nOftentimes you're so busy working within the business that you don't take the time to really look at some of the tax implications that may be affecting you in some ways that you could be\nHandling that business a ... some type of an entity for your business and utilizing a certain tax strategy to really be tax efficient within your business so having a good relationship with the tax professional becomes vital to any small business\n[noise] in a federal tax professional can help you file correctly to make sure that you're not I'm missing any of the important deadlines to take advantage of certain deductions that you're legally entitled to sew a variety of benefits I Believe can come out of working with a skilled\nA tax professional and in most cases folks just because someone is a CPA doesn't necessarily mean that they work out with business owners maybe there are CPA that really just works with individuals so you need to seek out a a good affirmed to be able to make sure that you're getting the proper advice\nAnd I believe a long term that the cost of that you may curve for that advice\nOr will the benefits far outweigh the cost is what I'm saying so I Know for myself I rely heavily on a sheep a CPA for our firm and he's on my show regularly he'll be on the show later today Darren cigarettes you hear him all the time on the show\nAre there for him as a nice medium sized firms that can handle a just about any type of\nA tax need whether it's individual or a small business medium size or even large businesses\nAre to be able to help you uh work through the the details and the intricacies of the tax laws that we all face out there things are constantly changing when it comes to taxes and want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of what ... and that we're not\nUh trying to take advantage of something maybe that is no longer available and then we don't want to ever get that letter in the mail about a you know from the IRS saying ah you know we found a discrepancy on your\nTax return okay so that's just my weekly tip or we also talked about the riddle each week we're going to get through this real quick we talked last week's rental recap was what is the longest word in the dictionary\nAnd the answer is smiles because there is a mile in between it [laughter]\nOh well that's a cute one but this week's read or what is seen in the middle of march and April that can't be seen at the beginning of either mind what is seen in the middle of march and April that can't be seen at the beginning of either month\nSo hopefully you guys or work on that that's a tough one I don't know about that I don't have to look that one up myself or a vent this week of course we had some big big things happen this week how many have you bought a lottery ticket\nAnybody I Know I bought some I don't buy them every week but I did I bought a lottery ticket or and ah unfortunately didn't win even if I Won though I Would have still been on the show today so [laughter] just to let you guys know how dedicated I Am um [noise] but one person one\nThe one point six billion I think it was close to two billion dollar a mega million jackpot or someone in South Carolina so if you've got any relatives in South Carolina that have gone dark you'll understand why because they probably are the one that one or the or\nThe mega million jackpot wow that's that's amazing what would you do if you one after taxes it was just a little under a billion dollars and that's amazing isn't it\nIt'd be hard to understand what to do at that point but it'd be fun trying to understand what to do I would I Would love that opportunity as I'm sure many of you would have as well [noise]\nUh on another note which is a horrible thing explosives apparently were sent to a variety of\nUh individuals Hillary Clinton Obama Joe Biden CNN investor George Soros a Robert De Niro I'm you know obviously these are all a very active individuals uh in the Democratic party\nA but boy this is a horrible thing I Know the president did come out and denounced these things as he should have\nAnd all of a talk radio has done it as well\nUh ... obviously this is not something that anyone wishes or any type of harm to come to anyone like this and and and we hope that they find the individuals who have done this and can make them a you know\nOr go through the court system and hopefully put them in jail for for this this is certainly something that should never happen and hopefully it never will again but unfortunately a lot of people out there that do things like this\nUm but anyway uh so Kay folks were going to take a short break and we come back to the break we're going to get into\nThe meat and potatoes of some of the volatility that had occurred this past week I'm sure a year a little bit nervous about that wondering

run out of time now back to the show\n[noise] All right\nJohn John brush the the word on welfare [noise] going to be here for a full hour today we're talking with someone that's been talked some markets toxin [noise] income planning and there's a lot\nOf things that when it comes to your retirement that you have to be fit to give out market conditions are part of it what's happening in the world economic [noise] uh and there is a lot happening right now as we can see with all of the volatility that we're faced with in the markets but that aside that\nAll the things that we do to gather all of our savings and investments and build our network throughout our working career at some point\nWe're trying to transition those things to the next\nIn line our loved ones whether it's our spouse whether it's our children whether it's a charitable organizations whatever it may be we're trying to figure out a way to simplify this and and pass our\nOur assets to our next generation as simple and affordable way however there are times when people have these brilliant ideas about trying to give things away for whatever the reason may be\nFor that I'm going to bring on estate planning attorney Jonathan Montana want to talk about the hey Jonathan how you doing\nJohn how are you fantastic you know I was just thinking and I said a side note yes the problem really is is that everyone is always trying to take a short cut [laughter] there you go that really started trying to take a short while we're going to go back to the topic but let me go far afield\nIn a little anecdote about about this everyone's trying to cut corners right so there's this museum in Washington DC among many museums writers that ... says there so this is the Bible museum and then there's Bible museums or giant it's a giant big thing that probably a lot of people have heard about it published but it's a big museum with a lot of\nAntiquities or supposedly antiquities and it's the um it's the passion project to the founders of Hobby Lobby ... do they created this museum and it's a bona fide museum has a museum curator it's a nonprofit the whole thing it's ... it's a complete legitimate museum that is just plain biblical artifacts right and so\n[noise] during the buildup to create this museum um\nThe founders of Hobby Lobby um went on a buying spree and all of a sudden there were these shards of or fragments of the dead sea scrolls came up for sale and then they bought a whole bunch of them\nAnd then they were displaying parts of these pieces apartment in their museum thinking that they were real well pay they found out that they weren't real and they found a bunch of them back to Germany to be tested and they realize they weren't that they were fake oh boy so so my point being here is that they\nThought you know what I mean like there have so so I use this example to try to say that people are always trying to cut corners and so here you have some people doing something that was really important to them um and they were willing to pay for a legitimate product rap and then you have people out there who are lying about this product\nWhich will allow you to transition smoothly into all phases of your financial life ultimately allowing you to be a successful retiree\nI'm proud and excited to be able to bring you the word I'm wealth radio network as your host I get to talk with professionals in all areas of finance this information can be invaluable to help you make good financial decisions\nDuring the show I Hope you can learn at least one important strategy that will improve your financial future also take advantage of our complementary retirement review\nPlease call her office of Grand Canyon planning it for eight or nine nine one ten fifty five for eight or nine nine one ten fifty five I look forward to meeting with you I'm John Dankosky reminding you don't run out of money before you run out of time now back to the show\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n\nAll right John John brush to hear the word on well going to be with you here for one more segment and I'd like to talk a little bit about\nOftentimes I get questions about\nWhat else can I be doing to put money away from my retirement and this this question comes up a lot with with individuals or I Will actually propose the question to new clients of mine or existing clients or when I asked them well how much are you contributing to your current\nRetirement accounts and are based on their income based on their cash flow I it's going to determine whether or not they can contribute more maybe they shouldn't even contribute as much as they are oftentimes I find they're asking what else can I be doing which is a great question for you to ask when it comes to\nReally are pushing your a retirement accounts and building up the value of those accounts as quick and as fast as you can bring on I'm\nA CPA with us here as many of you know down cigarette as a sick restrict Potter and high salaries a CPA here in Scottsdale\nAnd want to talk a little bit about uh what else folks can be doing Darren tax wise or to contribute to their retirement accounts if they're already participating in what what we would call an employer sponsored plan such as four one K. for all three B a four fifty seven plan those types of plants\nSo what I'd like to propose to you is I've got an email question here I'm going to paraphrase that and folks sent me this email questions to dear John at\nThe word on wealth dot com next year John at the word on welfare comment we'll get to some of those emails throughout the show's alright Dan [noise]\nSo this particular uh email talks about that I'm already contributing to my four one K. about eight percent of my income great\nUm I don't know what your income is didn't stayed here but that's OK percent of the income oftentimes people will\nDo a certain percentage of their income down because the company matches assert right now right so they say okay well since you're going to match up to this point that's what I'm going to contribute so that happens All right okay so now they're asking well what else can I be contributing to\nUh to build my net worth okay great question so\nIt was a great question yeah and and again one of the interesting parts of it as\nThe IRS has ... maximum contribution levels Eighteen thousand five hundred dollars is the maximum if you're over fifty\nThey they have what's called the catch her contribution of another six thousand dollars classified number big numbers yeah you can do up to twenty four thousand five hundred dollars into your for when the plant and that then a calendar year with a ... right\nAnd but but it's a confusing topic because a lot of people confuse the maximum contribution with the amount that the company's matching as you mentioned correct so maybe they match up to four percent may by metro to six percent\nThat's not the maximum the Irish fallout it's okay to make contributions even though your employers matching ... of all the mansion you can\nBut you can keep contributing and it it's always surprising to me how many people asked me the question [noise] hey I'm contributing my four one too but I like to contribute to my eye or a town or an Irish John I Want to put her with an additional sixty five hundred dollars\nAnd then I looked at their W too and see the you know they only put six thousand or a thousand dollars into another into their four one K. right right well the quickest way for them to remedy that is\nGoing for putting another sixty five hundred dollars into your four one K. in ... or if you care more yeah whatever you're you're you can budget I'm yeah I'm In and that is\nThe first thing but if you're fully contributing to your ... and four thousand five hundred dollars you're over fifty years old\nThen it becomes a little more difficult because uh depending on what your income level isn't probably if your income level is high enough to do that big of a contribution\nYou very well may be if you produce went on a plan many times you can contribute to an IRA right under the because of your income because of your income rivals right um so in that situation\nAgain you you can certainly do what's called a backdoor Ross ... contribution what that means as you make a mom with a couple of traditional Irish contribution um so it doesn't reduce your taxable income right and you turn around and you convert that ... contribution to raw fire right right\nBut now there are rules that apply to that restrictions of course if you got additional IRAs out there there's there's a lot of this is not just a simple thing now to sample cases by some cases it could be but um you know for those out\nThere who have IRAs if you've got are substantial IRA as well as your four O. one K. and things can get a little bit more complicated but working with a good CPA folks and a good financial planner you can get these uh additional contributions done little extra work but it can be done\nA little extra work and if you don't have much in your and other traditional area kill him it's a great strategy or something to consider it's not necessarily something to do\nRight exactly right such as you want to understand it before you make that decision and that's by talking to the right people All right so appreciate that email getting folks if you have questions anything\nFinancially you could send those email questions Jimmy a dear John at the word on wealth that come to tell you sometimes have to take my glasses off to read down you're not wearing glasses gift tax now actually I don't know so you don't wear contacts are glasses Idaho\nBooth who do you do for a well give it a few more years anyway [laughter] that's what I've been hearing for years [laughter]\nThey're starting to go to the evidence you feel better yeah that makes you a much better fires and fine print can be tough yes or against us send us email questions severe John at the word I'm up that come right there and so let's just kind of generally talk here we're coming up to the year end really were were you know we're almost now\nI Will we are in the fourth quarter right and we've got 'em all sorts of uh corporations right now are\nReporting earnings out there and it's been a a an additional a bit of volatility out there\nAre there is always opportunity for folks out there if they're working closely with their advisor or during periods of volatility possibly either to take some profits off the table\nOr depending on your length of time that you have to invest or maybe even buying more uh of some of the holdings that you have to take advantage of these little steps if you've got the cash available\nAnd that's a difficult thing right for a lot of people are because markets going down and and it's almost like if you're in Vegas and banning and you're losing and losing and losing and you go well I gotta win some more right\nAh but it's a little different in the stock market right because uh you're investing for the long term whereas in Vegas you're going for the quick hit here just try and try to make the quick you know profit and hopefully you leave the table if if you do hit it big\nAh which most people do alright right there is some underlying value supposedly the equities are [laughter] [laughter] exactly right but but my point was there and is is for those out\nThere maybe who um do you do get a little nervous or did get a little nervous during this period of volatility\nThere are options for them because most often times your portfolio may have some winners and you may have some losers within the portfolio so if you're thinking about making some type of a change or we balance of the portfolio you might be able to take advantage of some of the winners\nAnd off so offset some of those gains by selling some of the losers right\nRight and a lot of situations we talk about a year and starts getting closer and closer harvesting your losses right what we mean by that is just you can offset capital loss was against for example of games right oh if you do have a lot of games on your portfolio if you have a even if you think you've got some mutual funds that are going to throw off\nSome capital gains riding distributions um it's it's not a bad time to start thinking about re allocating your portfolio and offsetting taking some of the ... the waffles off the table and maybe ... ... email portfolios kind of counterintuitive when you think\nAbout it down and you're saying take some of harvest some of the law says because most people want to harvest the gains they want to see the right off it in a lock and again remember folks if you've got some holdings at you you you have in your portfolio that you really love and you've got some gained in those\nAh yeah you can sell them and you can you can lock in the game but there's a rule out there that says you can't go right away and buy back into that that whole thing and just to take advantage of those gains and and uh you know as a short or long term\nGame right there right yeah well and so what you can do you watch the altar or a big deal right you can you know sell aside for the last ...\nSo there are some rules that you have to worry about 'em you know what what I see a lot of clients doing is managing through their portfolio looking at the games that we've got a lot of loss of those they\nSell those positions right so and and that's just a simple way to do it while you're not going to go right back in ... next week\nBut it thirty days as it is that the ... it's a ... yeah the wash last roll right so folks if you did do something like that you can thirty days later if you liked that position you want to buy back and again you feel it's the right time now you can so that's a strategy\nAnd and get my feet stuck in there and stay in the boat so it's kind of cool is one area out in back in ... oh man that's kind of why I advise people to at least to get\nThe strategies mhm but this next phase of life was spent\nAll of our life working all about working is accumulating money accumulating money accumulating money\nWhen you're working and you're young and you're raising your family and the timing is off way down the road it's all about how much extra do I have to be able to put away for the long term and how can I make it grow as much as I can make it grow\nYou don't really have time to maneuver it so does you know um get online and put it somewhere you're for all and K go eat him any money most of the\nGet go aggressive and if it goes down you don't like it but you have time on your side and you have money coming in to maintain your lifestyle to do the things you need to do for your kids because you've got your paychecks\nNow as you get close to retirement\nThere's so many different things that your money has to do that it didn't have to do before that you don't know what you don't know how high right\nSo having not just the financial advisor who's going to advise you on you know this this investments better than that one it's going to make a quarter percent more than this one or that one but know what are the things that we're going to be faced with in retirement\nThat we're going to mean maneuver like like that guy taught us in the boat what are the things you could potentially happen and how when that happens if that happens how are you going to be proactive instead of reactive or he reacted quickly yeah around so\nThat's why I advise people to find a great wealth strategist somebody who works with the stage and first is going to lay out all the things that you could be potentially faced with that you don't think about how much of the money that you've accumulated over your lifetime\nAre you going to need to replace your paycheck what is the gap between what's going to come in from reliable sources of income like Social Security and a pension if you have one so that in this day how much of that are you going to need to replace that and when you're going to need to replace that uh\nOnce you tax situation down the road this is the first time in retirement that you actually get to choose\nYou know where you're going to take my mom and yeah and then if you think about it when you're working\nHe that paycheck going to be taxable they are just is but when you retired if you have after tax account and you have pre tax accounts and the attacks free accounts you get to choose if you play that right okay we have a plan where to take it for them to be more tax efficient\nMost people don't realize that most people don't even realize their retirement account could be a potential tax bomb if they don't do the planning we're guides\nIn forecasting what you're going to be faced with and how we can make that money work harder for you or do the right things do different things than you've done up to this point\nEven do it yourself first doesn't mean that that somebody's going to invest every single dollar with off and then they can't manage a portfolio but let's figure out what we need the money to do\nAnd it set it up correctly and then last but not least pick up the investments and\nAnd sometimes people end up working with with a good portion of the portfolio they need us to do a few things\nMaybe help them with their health care maybe help them with income replacement in the short term or income replacement if you know if your marriage where the surviving spouse or you leave Social Security optimization\nThe rice guide for this stage somebody who sleeps and drink like we do it the SPN associates going to help you build a plant set up a plan and\nThen you pick up the investment vehicles that's why I buy that sure you can go on the computer all day long and get cheap investments and they'll use a little pie shot until\nYou um you know stocks and bonds for your age is what the proportions are but you know what if the market goes down and it's kind of been a little tumultuous\nYear in there that share our bonds their heyday is actually over which I think\nIt is um your investments are going to do as well ... that's why we are for the retired fit announces long before you pick up the product\nLet's figure out what we need to solve for what are those things that you need to preserve and protect it how can you grow your money reliably let's start with that let's find out where you are exactly in your retirement lifestyle what you want that to look like\nLet's see what does that cost you and let's see\nHow much reliable

care costs and paying the bills all that stuff\nSo we really sit down and it can be a dirty word sometimes when people you know make a nice living especially as their kids grow up\nThey usually know
