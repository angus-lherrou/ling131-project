don't cause the campaigns talk to them and I want to run down these races for example Josh good morning to you you got to hear that from Missouri that Josh Hawley is pulling away and his race with Claire McCaskill correct\nYeah the polling that Republicans have been doing in the last week has shown Holly building a fairly\nSizable advantage now the rate is far from over but the base mobilization at the cabinet occupied really provided had has\nProbably boosted Holly more than any other Republican candidate in the country\nNow I I've already believed that Heidi Heitkamp is done and that Kevin Cramer is going to be the senator there I Am curious as to what you hear out of Arizona 'cause early voting is a real deal an Arizona people go early and they vote and it's opened up last week [noise]\nJustice Christian send them I was hit with an avalanche of her left wing legacy and the cabinet effect took over what do you hear from team mix Sally who up by the way our drafting up Doug ... side of the double digit\nYeah so this is going to be one of the closest races it my country a cinema has had a pretty small but consistently throughout the campaign\nBut like you alluded to this awkward up about set up an anti war kept the\nFact that you know she she said she and I looked OK to drew made a comment on the radio show in that role during the Taliban that's not a problem\nUm these these are things that are hockey in on the campaign fits rate is still very very close I don't think it's going to be a game changer that it's going to change overnight but according to the the ... campaign it sounds like they're slowly eroding sentimental even a even be up I have one or two this is going to be one of those races going to come down to the wire we made it may not even know the results\nYou know I think this is Matt ... of a twenty two and I think he's going to win fairly easily because they don't people don't ... chairs in Arizona but let's talk about Tennessee where I think Marsha Blackburn has pulled away I in fact I don't think that one's competitive what do you think\nThat that's another race at moving decidedly in the Republican direction and it\nYou know what I wrote about this about a month ago we had\nPolls that show rather than a very very very popular former Democratic governor\nBut it's hard when you go to get into a partisan Senate race it's hard to see those numbers I maintain themselves I mean are you working at the predator sixty percent job approval ratings all all all the way through the campaign so his it's become more partisan fight he said he supported by Kavanaugh's nomination under pressure from from the the right but\nYou know a lot of people on the left and let's see so it's a very very tough race for credit to hang onto that you\nWere five points [noise] now what what's finished with the I Believe Matt Rosendale closing in Montana I Believe that Braun is closing in Indiana I think Rick Scott's going to win but I Am most interested I had the hardest time in my own midterm madness contest\nPredicting Nevada I really the president's going out going going up north because of Vegas has to come in and cover 'em there but the north I'd have to go to Vegas the government so it's kind of a blanket the state deal what do you see is Dean Heller gonna be the magic the Claire McCaskill of twenty Eighteen Claire McCaskill was a twenty twelve\nIs Dean Heller when I mean that's a lot of us will be a very disappointing that Democrat but just in the Senate but potentially have a house I I still think that jak heroes that as a as a slight advantage because you know when you're an incumbent and you're stuck at forty six forty percent range it's still a tough place to be but that said uh how it has a real chance\nAnd or the Hispanic vote in Nevada what shows up in presidential years isn't always the most reliable\nTo turn out in mid term election and Democrats are really worried that they're not going

gaps he'd\nBeen scares on mainstream media since around the time he appeared on tape with NBC's Lester Holt I figured this up all these guys smoke and the same show so they're complaining that he scares but Brian shelter on CNN is complaining he gives too many interviews\nAnd he's he's he's creating air pollution he's polluting the airwaves with all the interviewer she gives me they cannot make up\nTheir minds where this guy's ... who here's what he is what he's doing and the conclusion from Daniel D. arrow or machine or a da da\nDa da da da da da da da da\nDa da de ... verdict sixty minutes into a pep rally\nThere are those you will see his ranch as worthy and those who will load them whatever unity can be made to exist by the president exists only within those camps that sixty minutes went looking for something greater is more proof than viewers needed that their approach to the president left\nSixty minutes out match the president best Leslie stall and sixty minutes according to variety magazine [noise] meanwhile I won't play a little bit of a ... give you a taste of it I'm\nFirst shovel Leslie stall asked the president about\nThis or the possibility that the Saudi Arabians\nThat the Saudis rather killed a Washington Post journalist in the embassy in Turkey the guy was gene going in and he'd been a critic of the king and the Saudi hierarchy and uh she\nWent into the embassy and was never seen coming out now there's a report that he actually recorded his own killing on his apple watch\nSomething about the way that you will to watch is connected to the cloud and she had a recording going and the authorities the uh figured out a way to get it off the cloud it's just awful and the president was very very strong in condemning\nOr the possibility that he was that this man was murdered years cut number one this is of audio and video courtesy of CBS who sixty bits and gravy and cut what\nEverybody wants to take care [laughter] you know that there's a lot to\nSay there's a lot of sick and [noise]\nMade me especially show because this man was a reporter [noise]\nSomething you'll be surprised me say that it's something really terrible and discussing about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be severe punishment\nFor me is very strong and in his condemnation has very forceful denunciation of what could possibly be the Saudis um murder in this guy in their embassy\nBut the bottom line here is that the ... the president cannot get a break from the media and we get that we understand that I liked watching the CNN or the sixty minutes interview last night because\nFrankly I kept saying to myself and this was a a point I made this morning with a with a buddy of mine if you've been in a coma and you woke up yesterday just in time to watch the sixty minutes interview you think wow this guy's a breath of fresh air to the American people really elect a guy like this\nLook at the issue of climate change people on the left are so worried about the condition the planet and I shouldn't say people on the left a lot of us are worried we're not oblivious just because some of us happened to be conservative doesn't mean we're we want the planet\nTo be harmed by\nAny man made formula now\n... you look at the condition I mean anecdotally pollution rates are so low um smog in Los Angeles things of the past you see things that are ... definitely changing emission standards are so high right now we're careful\nAs a culture about what we put into the air and the water we really are way more than we used to be is it enough well people get\nApoplectic about climate change used to be called global warming now they changed the climate change and the president's address last night to Leslie stall sort of suggested the way I Believe most normal Americans feel on this difficult subject\nYeah things might be changing they'll change back\nThey too hot it's too cold it's too mild as to dry it's too wet that's what the climate does what the president and the president acknowledged last night on sixty minutes\nThat you know maybe it's not a hoax it's not necessarily a hoax he's just not sure that managed to blame\nFor climate change and furthermore he said it's going to all change back was what he said and again this to me is what normal people kind of think this is the way people talk this is the way people feel most of us aren't activists\nMost of us aren't extreme on one side or the other and there's a lot of extremists in the climate change controversy let's listen to gather to what the president said cut number two again when there's a really extensive\nPretty comprehensive chat that the president had with Leslie stall of sixty minutes\nHere still think that climate change as a house [noise] but I think something's happening something is changing and it'll change back again [laughter] I don't think it's a hoax I think is probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give the trains and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nI watch this huge chunks of ice to falling into the ocean for anything to the level and hey you don't know whether or not that could have happened without man you don't know if you're a scientist your scientists that no I have to disagree with that you know I I was thinking [noise]\nOne of his head now I've seen the hurricane situation I change my mind really as climate change and I thought wow what an impact [noise]\nFlooding in well I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about it on his way say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael says that they say when they say that in the ... what about scientists and say it's worse than half\nHave to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda unless they handling this ancestry also have a political agenda\nUh he he talks like normal people talk frankly he talks like we talk he thinks like we think there are scientists who are\nDivided on this subject there's no shuttle science here he is right for every scientist who will tell you the United states of America is creating them contributing to the demise of the planet and the polar bears aren't going to have any ice in ten years you could find another scientist says no no\nNot true there's all these different patterns and it's there's no direct attribution or proof that man is contributing to the destruction of the planet that rhetoric of that's hyperbole I'm not a scientist I don't know the answer I don't I don't I don't pretend to I'm just telling you there is a debate there is an ongoing debate\nAnd it's okay to acknowledge that there's ongoing debate yeah the climate's changing their hurricanes it's wet it's dry it's hot it's cold you know I mean all this stuff that has\nI loved it when he when he pushed back a little bit on climate change and she says I Wish you'd go to Greenland I mean one [laughter] huge you wish you'd go to Greenland are you drunk what is that even but what what Bobby isn't it weird I watched it and I didn't have\nOf that kind of reaction whatsoever because I just figure I'm so used to it by now we're so used to watching them go after him and he handled himself find any was large and in charge and\nI think I Can't I Can't see Trump really trying to push Trump or get away with anything not ... not assume scan\nIt after two years you just get sent you'd think the press\nWere finally realized that just doesn't work and they were treated her like regular president William respect and she wouldn't be she would interrupt every time he tried to answer she's she's walking all step it up all the answers he says he gets that way in the past\nPeople treated the president of the United states\nWell actually it's yeah and that's that's par for the course I guess there's not one thing you said that I disagree with in terms of who you know what really played out how that played out\nBut it's business as usual and as long as he continues to be large and in charge and confident and cool and collected and firing when he needs to be tastes I it's I'm fine with it I Would I ... I did not have a negative reaction other than looking at going after him and look at him wanting her way\nAnd answering questions she posed to a one eight hundred six five five might maybe Assad
