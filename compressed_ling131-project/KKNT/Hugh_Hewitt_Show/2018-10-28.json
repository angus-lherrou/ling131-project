another edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and\nDr ... there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress\nOn the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects everybody sure so stress affects the body as this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension and\nYour muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right\nAt the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles didn't arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night\nAnd how many people do you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel for this and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their\nHow many ... at issue it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWas calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah it does build your ... but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys and your body shutdown actually dies\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if ...\nThat's right but I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called ask due process rights which has a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pasture as Asian food they're irradiated hum the calcium at least from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer right but these things don't absorb and the body that's up for a couple of reasons\nOne when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in it like a dumb first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but to see what happens when you take a Tom\nIsn't antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the count max formula\nBy combat formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that\nPowder and what happened to be put in hot water and you mix it up and drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that solves the problem is well\nYeah because when Cal say many of them are in a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says offense absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium it takes a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications sleeping pills the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula does absorbed in credit when the body the thing is that when you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right Dr ... I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the counter pain in my rent for in a way where I was able to sleep for the first time an IRS mean this is really amazing\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eighty two three eight eight five seven and give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred eighty two three eight eight five\nSeven well if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael pick us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick\nYou know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real notice all thing than right to their little trips a little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nDr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCal than many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles and they need them actually have the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take the comments formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a desk and my back in ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or even even had bypass surgery you should be on this count acts formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady was suffering from fibromyalgia\nWhere she was having pain in just about every join her body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I are the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough but she was the one who took a week of the formula ... formula and um\nShe said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends so that's amazing\nAnd when I use it with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes he was in us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up and their muscles in real relax shape\nThe really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of ... them in the system well those are very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fishing and cows that many of them\nIt's also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's something so it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way
