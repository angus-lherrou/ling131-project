I'm going to be shocked if they find it\nBut I I and I expect the president be exonerated but I still think it would be banned from the bureau and the department if they leak that before the election it will it will be just like coal me coming to the to the microphone about Hillary during twenty sixteen they gotta get these high profile investigations off the cycle of politics yeah\nYou'd figure would be bad you'd think they'd be they'd been compromised in the last couple of years I mean it's it was terrible now I think Sessions' is is moving I'm not with regard to this country is recused himself but I think uh he is the director are trying to clean up the top levels of the euro\nAnd the department to try and get politics out of there it's essential you're right this is a huge structural question and I don't mean by that downgraded I mean it's very or to the people I have confidence in the integrity of the department and the bureau to operate on politically so you're right this would be this would be another huge problem along those lines\nI Do not expect um attorney general sessions last much after the election that hoping Michael ... replacing them a mostly they have a comment on that but I Need your quick comment on my ... going to turkey and Saudi Arabia\nA big Clinton's comments he said I don't want to talk about the facts trying to make them look bad what he says I Want to talk about the fact they want to talk about back 'cause we don't know what the facts are yet that's what he said and that's exactly what he should have said Jim Talent\nYes and we don't know what the facts are you know you've been reading and I've been reading but Danny but had a good article today on the on the Web site actually was from yesterday\nSix till two to six six fifty six sixty five and six or two to six six fifty six sixty five or go to Steve us well done mortgage equalizing lender and the low when he to Ninety two in in the last one was that one ... one on one knee for [noise]\nTake a look on your bed find cell phone to their without jobs no now trying to your base is a pair of overall that liberals not soon to anymore\nA perfectly good laptop that has a tiny a laugh in mind [noise] more stuff but still no jobs well you really have both the stuff is defined as household articles considered as a group sometimes this stuff\nIs no longer needed wait no longer needed the human rights gets really lose jobs you were looking for those are really near the stuff inside of your stuff inside that winter coat and live with the the the\nJob and to unlock those jobs and starts when you're doing it yourself to your local good will\nUse that we do it we don't need to do well we still use dump to provide job training for people right here in your community\nTo just like teaming up with good will who helped create jobs and isn't that were partying with the Olympic over the tar and from the eighties silver ban will building stuff creating jobs find you and he was donations center at goodwill dot or a message from goodwill in the ad council\nHow to get a dying of one of the stages of a disease when someone in your life as a ...\nA day goes by that you don't ask questions we need full time care either and so many questions\nWhere do you start how can I get to have\nAll ... of reliable resource for information about all sirens and related to manage this happening where can I find the answers the answers are starting\nTo get me tell you about tax cuts work dot com that's where I'm standing everyone who wants to be involved in the elections because our friends are sponsors over jobs created network\nTo reorient and tax cuts work dot com for the closing kick to make you affect them in the election you can make calls you can send emails text knock on doors kick our neighbor to the polls get involved with Rick Scott in Florida get involved with\nMatt Rosendale up in Montana no matter where you are you going to Martha ...

got used to call up and up in Virginia Falls under\nThe sea in Virginia [noise] so I Walk out the plants like Ninety five and a hundred percent humidity so I go inside immediately I turn on BBC World news\nExpecting to see how are the blanket negotiations going you know Theresa May's over in Europe trying to save the deal and\nNot have a hard breakfast blah blah blah [noise] and ah and of course we had a lot of pressure will be reporting and it is becoming increasingly clear that the number two in the secret services the fellow who ordered the interrogation the interrogation went wrong whether by designer and Ken\nThere's some horrific details out there put out by the Turkish media but looked as soon as the yellow dog media of Europe I'm not going to trust them on the details on the bench I get the forensics but\nLooks like the number two guy in Saudi Arabian intelligence or Tibet\nAnd uh\nThe question will be did he do so with the knowing approval of the crown prince and the ... that's the only question will find that out but that's what I thought I Would say on BBC Breakfast and showed me instead of at a reporter in\nNorth Dakota they said there is you know eight people per square mile and North Korea went to the whole North Dakota thing more more cows than people in North Dakota it's hard to find people to talk to about politics I said what in the world of the BBC doing in North Dakota well Heidi hide camps\nOf sexual assault survivors and rape victims as well as miss naming people as race ... those has shattered her campaign\nPurely by twenty points and BBC was set up there to explain to Brits why Americans would be so upset over publishing uh lets them a hundred and twenty women many of whom were not sexual assault survivors or many of whom had not given their permission\nAnd it's like a tailspin and they spent a lot of time talking to Heidi Heitkamp supporters who are saying we're though so crushed we're sorry she did she's terrible I'm terrible we're all terrible yeah you are who thought that up and Heidi Heitkamp Anthony when you have to my knowledge but she'd done she toast [noise]\nWhat was interesting is they didn't ask will have any impact on any other candidate of course it should every Democrat in every race is attempting to exploit\nThe me too movement for democratic purposes that's what the ... was all about\nWas the attempt to use a me too movement Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby moment to smear him an innocent of bad Bill Cosby and didn't generally turn into an attack on all man people like me people like you got nothing to do with this who conduct themselves a gentleman who growing up the right way\nWhoever arrives at thirty six years or Thirty years or twenty five years or Fifteen Years or ten years or one day whom you are in trust and you've got daughters\nAnd mothers and you do not act this way there's a there's a five percent of the population three percent I don't know creepy terrible horrible people Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby's among them and there are a lot of it by a survivors of sexual abuse and rape out there I Know some I represented one\nAnd it's a terrific how indifferent institutions are\nWhen abuses occurred\nBut that is not a license Democrats\nTo turn everyone into a mob shouting meat to at innocent people like Brett Kavanaugh\nOrient Heidi Heitkamp ... position\nTo publish a list of people who are not victims of rape or sexual abuse or who did suffer that terrible assault and did not want to be publicly out it\nShe's got a bunch of list from a women's advocates groups around the state didn't check with the people that's Heidi Heitkamp try you know what I I'd probably showdown only for that punished Claire McCaskill for that I'd punish a Bill Nelson for that I'd punish Joe mansion for that Joe mansion butter for cabinet but he didn't do so until it was over\nThere we already had fifty one boats he knows his comments or just decided to do I'd still vote for pat Morrisey in\nVirginia over Joe Manchin imagine about for the next one [noise] of course you're not going to vote for better or for Ted Cruz of course you're going to vote for Josh Hawley\nOver Claire McCaskill and the guy is creeping up John James in Michigan I think we're an AC fill in the game but it it's that that will require Ohio to surprise away Kentucky surprised when they elected 'em that seven in the off year that was truly astounding or he was supposed to lose by five to seven and he won by the same amount that's what\nRene she won't be only to ten point air and the polls but John James up in single digits and rising I think he is the most interesting Senate candidate tied with Muslim exile in Arizona because they're fighters there are veterans of combat been offended you they defended me with their lives\nBut at the mic Sally in the air and eight ten providing ground support for troops in combat\nOr first attack pilot fighter attack pilot who was a woman in the air force history and a John James out of West point became an Apache pilot fought in Iraq and Afghanistan then then sadly is like took a bad turning out to the University of Michigan business school\nBut then again a successful entrepreneur in Detroit and I do not understand why we have not got stories everywhere about the the black guy up in Michigan who poop flies Apache attack helicopters went to West Point and has given Debbie Stabenow a run for the money you know why you know I Will get paid or work every night on every show and nothing about John James\nBecause John James Lewis Black and a Republican in bed O'Rourke is white and a Democrat\nAnd the mainstream be is full of blue Barbara bubbles that like white Democrats in red states and they blow a lot of money and time on them and they really are afraid I'm an African American like John James in Michigan they are afraid of John James ... if I if you get the Koch brothers or somebody\nI Would just poor ad after adding to the television marketed Detroit I'd go and try and get ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of the African American by the John Jay and yeah he's a Detroit kid he went to West Point he made good he went to Michigan we like to add all us where you know Michigan State people like Alberta\nWinning John James can when you get behind that and I I get the sense that hedging I saw on BBC Watson MSNBC you know my my viewing is
