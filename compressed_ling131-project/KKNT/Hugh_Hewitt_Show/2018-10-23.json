want the military down there we want the whole bill\nI think it was someone in a couple of calls ago when other countries build the wall immigrant stopped coming in and I think that's what we need to do here and we then Democrat playbook\nDemocrats aren't saying anything because they want these people and so they can stay in power because they're assuming these refugees aren't going to vote for them\nA couple years ago these Democrats while for the wall\nNow all of a sudden because Trump is saying they're quiet no no no we need this wall and the American people want this small if you let the people and put them in detention centers until you can process the mall\nOr those detention centers are for ... there's too poor to point problem they're number one the detention centers are full from the last caravan\nAnd number two you saw what happened they got federal judges to say you can't separate children from from adults in terms of their detention centers and if you have them together as a family you can only keep them there for X number of days before you have to turn them loose end of the population and that's you know we're turning thousands and thousands of people are\nA loose end of the population where they'll never come back for their actual asylum hearing and they become part of the eleven million twelve million twenty million illegal immigrants in this country that's the problem that's why the border wall by the way while I agree with you\nUh did you say your name was Debbie Donna\nDonna sorry so you were tag team called from your yourself and your husband but um that's why a ... when we talked about the\nUm a wall not being the only solution here because the port of entry will still be a port of entry in between the giant wall and people are going to come to that and do the asylum claim that even if they do get held in a detention center it'll be a temporary stay then they're going to get her you know released into the population an added to those numbers so\nAh the wall as a part of the solution but it is not the only solution and ah and I don't know what the answer is other than what RJ home and said and that bring our lawmakers back\nClose the loop

joining us to start your day great conversation with David I'm ... I'm not a time before I could ask them\nThe question about the caravan and and it's pretty obvious question and that is\nHow is it and why is it\nThat no Democrat politicians have spoken out against the care about\nNot one not one I mean\nQuite literally no one is saying whoa whoa whoa whoa there started with two thousand and it's not what the seven thousand and by the time they reverse the one thousand miles they still have to go to get to the southern border of the United states it'll probably go ten\nTwelve Fifteen thousand whoa whoa whoa whoa we can't just take all of these people in\nWe can't just you know you don't release all of these thousands of people into the into the fabric of the continental United States of America on a wink and a nod promised that they'll come back for an actual am that are now asylum hearing at some point we can't do that and also why is that the why is the overwhelming majority\nOf these individuals who are in this caravan why are the men of working age because there aren't a ton of families according to those reporting from a you know that caravan\nTheir families it's mostly males of working age that are coming here are these people are really\nSeeking asylum is there really something that terrible going on in the middle eastern Asia or Middle Eastern rather Central American nations although the president pointed out there are people from the middle east who have joined in as well\nRemember our southern border is essentially a revolving door for people to come into the United states from not just Mexico or from Central America but quite frankly from all over the world\nBecause these other countries are not taking their sovereignty as seriously as we um we would like to hear but anyway\n[noise] all of the Central American migrants are these things really so bad in their countries that they need to seek asylum from persecution and fear that they face in their own countries is really what this is about is this really a humanitarian issue where these people are being persecuted\nAnd they cannot you know they they cannot stay in their own countries without dying\nWell let's put that to the test for a moment we'll give it a little credit to Fox News here and do a one of my listeners on my local show in Cleveland ah for sharing this with me this was a Fox News report from Sunday\nAnd I'm\nQuestions by the reporter here from Fox News of a member of the caravan I think are extraordinarily revealing well the questions but moreover the answers are extraordinarily revealing I Want you to listen very carefully to what is really going on in this caravan of quote unquote migrants\nThat many of us believe are actually more like invaders trying to circumvent us immigration law please give us all\nAs I can see as far as I can see I can see on during the immigrants headed north to the bus into Honduras they went through about a mile and now they're trying to tackle Mexico right now they are north of that river\nNorth of the bridge you saw people on yesterday so last night people got frustrated found a bridge Mexico's process about six hundred and forty people get a visa for potentially asylum here already do Ninety Days have look out for us if they weren't so last night in house across the river swimming\nCame in droves I had to see maybe two hundred immigrants last night maybe in a thirty minute time crossing the river coming here and now you see them now say they're going to be as the care of and they claim they're on their way to a town called ... there were about we're right now about twenty miles north of that river is\nReally going to have a ... right now some of the people here you can see they're taking a break [noise] got some shade here they're getting something great guy will be joined now by one of the members of the a caravan his name is Louis here from Honduras tell me what are these people going and why are they doing right now\nWe're going to let us\nPeople wanted to go to the border of United States then we come they coming over here because um [noise]\nA situation in our country is going back\nOh let me ask you this so as you know the un ac ours here un high commissioner for refugees actually brought them in to try to help the process saying now the standard that they're going to use as unless you're a victim of them have a credible fear of persecution from race nationality or religion or political views don't qualify for asylum\nSo what are these people going to say when they get the United states\nOr in a safe on the phone all day on probably ask\nYou they may have been something that they can say I mean I'd a say so they can't they can't go to school so they can apartments and they can go to work as you know President Trump is that's it\nThat's it\nThat's what you needed to hear and I hope you understood what you just heard\nCannot claim asylum in the United states unless you are\nFleeing persecution on the basis of race or religion or sexual orientation etcetera he ran down the reporter ran down the things that you can claim asylum for your being persecuted in your country so what is it he asked this ... this caravan remember that you're going to say when you get up there and he said basically we're coming to pick your jobs\nYou heard him\nWere coming to take advantage of your educational system are going to put our kids in your schools and we're going to take your jobs he said we want to go there and we want to work and then what are you going to do with that money by the way are you going to spend it in the United states let's say at least helping to contribute to the United states economy\nAnd he's not going to let people in Mexico said they are not going to let these people pass I Will tell you aren't earlier today we saw about two hundred and why and police were going to stop them on this highway they pulled back they retreated I don't think they want a confrontation but the point is president said he's not going to let people when you got to\nSay that I saw last last week we stay over there but a friend a motor full them all and people said voter Neal radio in the United states\nThere's a change though as you know that Mexico in the United states have posted reaches third party saved agreement unless you follow fires giving request asylum in Mexico we're not going to the United states is not going to let you and that's going to be the reason for denial\nGoing to stand up\nWas back they send them back to our country we're coming back [noise]\nAnd that's what it was funny I Wonder\nIf they send us back we're going to turn around and come back again so he says we're going to come here and we want to take jobs and we're going to take\nMoney and we're going to send it back to support our family's back there this is why it's the vast majority of the members of this caravan are like I said working age males\nBecause they're going to come to the United states to work they're not fleeing persecution for the race in Honduras they're not fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation they're not fleeing persecution because of their um their uh ethnicity but not fleeing persecution because of a of any reason whatsoever\nThey're coming to the United states because their nation can't give them work and so they're coming to take jobs for people in another country and they're not going to repatriate those dollars back to their own country they don't want to come to the United states to be American\nHow do we know this\nBecause they're not walking under the American flag they're walking behind the massive street with banner of the Hondurans live and then they were flying hunger and flags over themselves as they march\n\nIf a group of seven thousand people tries to enter another country flying their own flag that is not a migration that is an invasion\nIn troops in guardsman locked arm in arm saying you're not coming through you're not getting to the port of entry to make your claims what should the president do because in an interview aboard air force one yes\nBut the president made clear there is no limit to the number of troops he is willing to send to the border\nTo stop this caravan\nHe previously vowed to send the military as opposed to the national guard to confront this true which the un now says over Seventy two hundred number strongest started with about a thousand\nNow it's over seven thousand it's organized\nIsn't just you know legitimate grass roots and just people are starting to walk and somebody else followed like Forrest Gump they're not just running alongside of just random laying off the cuff this is an organized effort these people are funded and they're fed they're giving rides\nNot all walking

X chromosomes in their X Y chromosome individuals it's there is no third option there is no combination better off there is no one who has both able to become pregnant and to impregnates another that doesn't happen there are just two genders there\nAre males and females hurts ... that is not trying to define transgender out of existence but what it is trying to do is protect people from trying to protect 'em you know women for example from being redefined out of existence by this ridiculous moving\nTo the president simply is is you know stating what everybody knows this is called science it's amazing how much the left clings to science when it comes to things like climate change and they tell anybody who doesn't buy into man made climate change that they're anti science even though there is a lot of science that says\nClimate change is not caused by man\nBut when it comes to something that that is completely immutable such as chromosomal biology human biology and ... why they don't recognize that science\nIs simply staggering but the New York times is freaking people are transgender could be to find out of existence under the under the Trump Administration just another example of the media carrying the water for the left and they're radical agenda\nLet me go to a Georgian next and this is going to be Richard you're up let's move on to Columbus ohio Donna here on the Hugh Hewitt showdown or thanks for joining us go right ahead\nIn the world am I going crazy talk about a a cat and come to power and how ... or ...\nOf course of course please\nOkay I think our military has gotten better loyal and as far as awful as they are when they get here but I'm On a light it's cheaper\nIt's like you know they can't get large laws here expect that they had captured by any stretch scarce they're eating out at like ... cats\nAt the guaranteed lowest dealer prices when you invested a liberty save you can be confident that you'll receive unmatched quality and customer support with the industry's best lifetime warranty experienced the perfect solution to\nSecuring your firearms photograph family heirlooms and other valuables whether you're buying their first safe or you just outgrown what you currently own stop by aging liberty safer on match sales service and insulation\nChandler and Peoria easy liberty safe dot com ... liberty safe dot com [noise]\nMorning glory America most or I Can't I'm not there is a dog that's what happens when you go to Pittsburgh I'm sure Bob friends will understand that he's sitting in for me today from beautiful ... every time I go to Cleveland\nAnd Bob is doing damage because he got in mind that there may feel really hadn't been such a Sam Darnell family wouldn't be too far in one right now\nFlaming Bob for that but if he can turn around getting set it back in Japan's measure of assays under control Kevin McCarthy all will be forgiven side from off your job thank you Robert [noise]\nOnly you can manage\nWhen he's not even president and ah he he does an exceptional job of that yes indeed morning glory to all done in a quarter Everytime I still is on the\nLine I got to pay him a yeah morning glory glorious morning however you want a phrase that that doesn't cost me money about France joining you live from the pain free relief factor outcome studios at my home base in as you said beautiful Cleveland, Ohio the rock and roll capital of the world\nOf and fourteen twenty the answer to the pain free really factor dot com studios there of think it's much for joining us big program today David I'm drunk or coming up a little bit later in this hour or in the eight o'clock hour I ... I'm Sorry eastern time and the third our the program got used to that part of things\nUh my friend Peter ... United States civil rights commissioner will be joining us to talk about the caravan into a galaxy there of and also in the\nThird our of the program this morning we will hear from ah RJ home and he's the director of government relations for fair\nThat's an important organization you probably are very aware of\nAs a loyal listener of the Hugh Hewitt show of the federation of Americans for immigration reform it is an extraordinarily important organization that really has their finger on the pulse of what's going on with respect\nTo the ... now the caravan is the lead story of the morning without question and a and that includes the last night's massive\nRally in Texas for Ted Cruz are held by the president of the United states did you see\nNot just how many people were there but there was ongoing coverage throughout the day yesterday on Fox News and in other places of the thousands and thousands of people who waited in line overnight some for twenty four and maybe even pushing up to thirty\nSix hours to get in\nTo hear the president in Texas a rallying for Ted Cruz last night and by the way what do you know what a strange strange sight to see you know it was only two short years ago maybe two and a half a little\nBit I guess when you go back to the summer of twenty sixteen in the primary season in the in the spring of or excuse me some are twenty fifty and then the primary season\nIn the spring of twenty six team when Donald Trump and Ted Cruz we're not exactly sharing stages together in warm embrace a lying to head the calls and\nAccusations of you know National Enquirer stories about uh oh Ted Cruz's father and related to JFK and and and uh you know the assassin all\nOf these kinds of strange things but I'll tell you what nothing like two years of Democrat insanity to bring former political rivals together in common cause\nAnd at the end of the day that's what this is that's what this was\nThe president of the United states last night rally in for and he's done this with others to\nYou know President Trump and Lindsey Graham didn't always get along very closely as you know Lindsey Graham was more closely aligned with one of President Trump's fiercest critics the late John McCain\nBut it's amazing what the Democrats can do for Republican unity and unification simply by being well very democratic and that's wrong way say but being very Democrat\nAnd that's essentially what has happened last night so the president of the United states last night a rallying for Ted Cruz and they came out by the thousands and thousands of people seem to at least say people the media\nThe media the left Democrats whatever you want to call them and kind of it's kind of all one in the same those are all synonymous with one another the media and the Democrats and the left are literally all synonymous with one another and I must say that these are Trump crowds are overblown they tell you this bronco Obama held a rally\nIn California a short while ago filled with about three million just to just the the area and the county he was in about three million very very blue voters it's a very blue district hip seven hundred and fifty people come out to sea of\nPresident Trump has tens of thousands at all of these rallies there were always overflow cloud crops outside they're studying up big TV monitors\nYou know big screens for them to watch from the outside they just want to be a part of it and the reason why isn't just enthusiasm for what President Trump stands for\nIncluding his very strong statements yesterday about um about the caravan of migrants that about securing our border and so on and so forth it's not they're not just rallying for what the president is preaching and what the president President is is I'm advocating\nIt's rallying against the tactics of the left rallying against the bullying rallying against the intimidation rallying against the harassment rallying against the physical battery in a salt in some cases route rallying against um you know the media calling for these things rallying against the left\nA laughing when Republicans are treated in such ways\nI Know you played this yesterday bad voice and all we put a lot of audio last yesterday and I'm surprised you didn't play the whole show an audio form because this is poison was so bad and get well soon hopefully you are a couple you're not listening right now you should be sleeping after a night in Pittsburgh God Bless you\nAre but you should be sleeping but a Phillip range of course former Obama a deputy ... deputy assistant secretary of state\nUh on on MSNBC essentially mocking Mitch McConnell who was a being harassed in a restaurant away Sarah Sanders that's been harassed and restaurants the way so many others have just been attacked\nOr just for being Republicans\nJust by rabid liberal protestors who listen to their masters\nOn national television\nOnline they listen to know that well they can't listen to him there are now there are no Democrats elected positions or other well respected positions of authority calling for an end to the harassment and intimidation\nThere no no one is calling for an end to this have you heard Nancy Pelosi have you heard Chuck Schumer\nThe two ranking members of Congress for the Democrats have you heard any of the more popular\nOr Democrats or who are kind of in the news you know the Elizabeth Warren's the Cory bookers the Kamala Harris says have you heard any of them denouncing Maxine Waters and those who would call for more violence intimidation and harassment of Republicans no\nThey're not saying anything former President Obama who is still revered by the left\nIs he's speaking out and saying no stop this this is not what it's about we don't win in the streets by by uh intimidating harassing and and and quite frankly battering people in certain circumstances we don't win that way we went up the ballot box no\nNone of them are saying this instead they're on television law allowing the media and people like Philip brains using the media to call for more of this and guess what it has done\nAt this rally those thousands of people to all of these places where the president is holding\nRallies by the thousands the you know they can all get in just starting to seats and yet they're willing to sit outside for twenty\nFour hours there for thirty six hours they're still getting like growing up but a football game just send the chance that they can get in and if they can't get in then they'll cheer from the outside of the venue like they did last night last night down in Houston\nThat's that's not just pro Trump that's rebelling\nAgainst the insanity of the left that's rebelling\nAgainst\nThe calls for violence and the lack of calls for civility that's what's happening so the president of the United states really found a tremendous you know has found really a tremendous rallying cry\nYou know and and that is against what the ... you know he he latched on to something I Know he didn't coin it\nBut a lot of people are truly brought into play and the president seems to have been braced it and that is jobs not mobs Democrats if you vote Democrat it brings you mobs if you vote Republican the president has taken a saying now it\nBrings you jobs and he's a hundred percent right over four million jobs created since he took over and of course the lowest unemployment rate we've seen in this country in nearly what five decades\nLiterally five decades I Want to say goes back to Nineteen sixty nine [noise] ah the lowest unemployment rate and of course the lowest all time unemployment rate for so many of those subgroups including African Americans Latino Americans are women and youth\nUm you know following of of of historical tradition just in terms of voter norms if she is able to buck those trends if he is able to stop that that wave from happening\nIt would be one of the most amazing accomplishments in modern political history\nThat just would be would be he would\nBe stopping something from happening which is expected of the minority party which is to gain that number of seats if he somehow had that off not only should he be given all of the praising the world for his ability to uh to rally voters in the face of incessant negativity from the media about his own party\nTo keep control but she would be look you know he would be bucking political history\nIn the same way that he bucket when he won the office of president and the first place it would just be an amazing thing but at any rate the president last night obviously a spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states and\nTying it to the caravan why and how [noise] quite simply because the Democrats are trying to import more voters by way of that caravan\nSays we're going to stop it\nAnd he says we will have nothing [noise]\nSo we will not used to stop that\nWe're going to talk more about that as we continue
