that is sort of like a sweeping rejection of the Democratic argument that all these Republicans are surging\nIt does so first of all the head when for you know the party if if ... like the Republicans control the house in the Senate and the presidency [noise]\nThe typical number of seats lost in such a campaign is twenty five\nTwenty five would flip the house\nOr the in in in a according to Gallup in a in a year in which the president is unpopular and see the Trump is unpopular that means he's about fifty percent and nobody gets much better than that these days right but then the average will be thirty seven percent nobody's predicting that right now\nNow the election will break one way or the other they often do but for the last two weeks as you point out\nThe Republicans have been strengthening and isn't that odd shouldn't there be that's I think that's one of the reasons why there's furious a reaction from the far left from their point of view this man was unacceptable and everybody should see it by now\nBut you know a Rick Scott's very close and Florida and the news this morning is Trump is on his way back down there again yep and that means Rick Scott wants him to come\nSo yeah I think that uh it is a dog fight this election I don't think we know how it's going to go and uh I think it matters very much which is a question you were asking because\nIf you send to any weapon can be you know Paul Ryan pointed out that eighty percent of the bills they passed and they pass a lot of them were bipartisan fails well ... thank God for that and it's it's the same phenomenon is the fact that most Supreme Court cases\nAre decided by overwhelming majorities most of them nine to nothing I think right but but at at an all of the difficult cases and all the cases that raise questions of which what is the direction of the country we are deeply divided\nAnd the house will be used as a weapon to fight the administration if the Democrats take it\nAnd then if you want that and that's what you should vote for\nAnd I got to go back to the clothes on this what you just said the media is deeply invested in the idea that President Trump is bad and should be rejected therefore if he isn't repudiated his party is reputed in either house but certainly if it isn't a reputed in both of them\nThe media will be face to face with the fact that they are not representative of the country they think they are representative Bob and they are not leading the population in the way they think they are entitled to lead and I think that is a source\nThat is the bottom line is that people feel toppled from their purchases of power\nYeah and that's been a problem with Trump for a long time but that's not a particular Trump problem just remember it became since the Nineteen sixties and not before by the way\nPersonal experience they really do pay more for your clients don't be fooled by other dealers who claimed to pay the highest prices it's usually just

friends as I Do to have your heartbreak for them you can just be a human being just be a human being but I'm also limited with members of the media who are attempting to politicize this tragedy\nTo blame Donald Trump for it to blame Kevin McCarthy for it there is I Can't go lower than ascribing anti Semitism somewhat\nYou cannot go lower than calling them a neo Nazi it's impossible to do that

broken apart receded\nAnd we look up and down the races we see Martha McSally winning in Arizona as she should we should Dean Heller winning in Nevada as he should in the Senate race there which he Marsha Blackburn running away with it in Tennessee and they thought it was going to be closed Democrats than we know that Kevin Cramer has beaten Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nCongressman Kevin Cramer great guy going to win by Fifteen points we know that attorney general Missouri Josh Hawley is winning in Missouri we think\nThan businessmen Mike Braun is being Joe Donnelly in Indiana Joe Donnelly haven't voted against Brett Kavanaugh on in the end up being very strong Trump Pence country of course we think governor Rick Scott is winning in Florida where he's done an excellent

state against Claire McCaskill and the most recent polling I obscene\nHas hit my head by a very solid poor points I actually believe it's further ahead than that Josh Hawley welcome back to the your your show my right you're farther ahead in most places in four points\nWe feel we feel very good about it you but we also now that we've got eight days ago and we cannot take anything for granted that it's going to be a tight race is going to be tied all the way home and we've got to get out there and do all we found that I said\nNo I haven't heard a lot of places in Missouri from St Louis we got a big flame thrower they're across to represent city et cetera so tell people in Missouri specifically or they're still able to do early voting or is that close to\nWhere we have this traditional absentee voting in Missouri\nWe don't have a we don't have early voting like other states but the traditional as a voting and a look we need folks to start planning to get out on November the fix them make sure that you set aside time to\nTalk to your friends if they ah I Need help getting to the polls make sure that uh you know you're you take a friend with you through the bowls and we're going to need every last vote because it's going to be tight\nGot Josh Hawley it seems to me though that the Democrats are basically folding their tent in Missouri in North Dakota to try and save a boat so there were Claire McCaskill had an awful debate performance she and her ads calling other Democrats crazy Democrats how did that play with their base\nWell you know I think it does show that they're a Casco really has read\nThe desperation phase of her campaign I mean you could see that in in our debate last Thursday is very angry very frustrated but your ears of thank you so frustration is really not with me it's with the voters of the state I mean she has\nNot done what the voters of the state told her to do she has not done what he promised them she would do and they're not happy about it and and that's the problem of course has\nA role and Martin who is of course a man and a lot but he's a friend of mine just tweeted out what Claire McCaskill not quote one of those crazy Democrats quote and was one of the dumbest ever recorded in political history she needed a strong energized space in twenty Eighteen her appeal to white rural voters\nWith that ad ticked off black voters if she loses that ad is the reason so you can see right there uh Josh Hawley that\nShe clearly is flailing\nWell I I think there's no doubt about that I mean the the is the\nIs filing has a good word or she is she trusted him say desperate you see is you know let's remember what we saw from the Democrats\nAnd the Kavanaugh mayor just a few short weeks ago that they are willing to stay and do anything in order to regain power and I'm afraid center McCaskill who was with mayor every step of the way that sees no different than so uh this is really this election as a referendum\nOn what they want to do to our country on their behavior they're just the disgrace that they are carried out with regards to judge Kavanaugh on their entire agenda that was that's Alexis about\nNow let's talk a little bit about that the judge Kevin up the confirmation now justice cabinet or a successful confirmation Claire McCaskill was invisible uh she didn't she she voted against them but she was invisible because she couldn't figure out what to do\nWhat in Missouri and think about that because he's obviously a good man well qualified and he was ... what do they think about her writing from that debate\nOh I think there appalled by it and I have people say to me all the time they just cannot believe the way that the Kavanaugh was treated they can't believe the way the Senate Democrats the coordinated smear campaign and your wife McCaskill\nUh well she went right along with it you should never raised our voice against it but she lets us forget she was in favor of the Democrats sham investigation she was in favor of delaying his confirmation votes so that the circus could go on I mean she's on record for all of those things so she was part and parcel\nOf the whole smear campaign and now she says in fact she said our debate all I didn't have anything to do with that oh that's just nonsense I see what they're every step of the way and I think voters are going to remember\nNow let's talk about the tragedy of this weekend a Josh Hawley when you get to the United States Senate you're gonna be in a body that's very deeply divided in a country that is profoundly broken but I think part of
