I I Believe the margin of victory say people have to pick the winners and twenty five race but they also have to pick margin of victory\nAnd I'm going to do plus for for Martha McSally which we have you know under one one to three and plus for\nA margin of victory and I think it's going to be so much easier than people believe ... but that there is a built in desire in the media\nI mean deeply ingrained almost some conscious to make races competitive when they are not when they hit the wall and it's sort of like Todd Akin hitting the wall in St Louis Christians to them is the Democrats topic and she actually ran her boss right into our office the Grand Canyon cliff and and there is no way\nTo recover from that topic and talking about voluntary rape um six years ago and you just can't come back from that\nLet me talk to you though about the meta thing that's going on here\nDemocrats were panicked or a week ago because of the cabinet in fact Israel and by the way it continues to be real ah people were disgusted by what they did to Brett Kavanaugh along comes the crazy bomber David French calls him a super fan I call him a deranged psychopath uh son's Thirteen would be bombs and there were bombs to targets\nAnd then comes the neo Nazi Trump hating\nMassacre of Pittsburgh Jews\nI think Democrats are hoping that the jar to the country will somehow jar the election\nAnd Catherine Rampell writes in the Washington Post saying it's almost a staunch and to me\nThe White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump or are poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what their rights Trump isn't to blame his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election now I Believe she sincere\nAnd I believe most of the elite media believes that but I think that absolutely is repulsive to the ordinary American what do you think ...\nI I not only is it is it repulsive but it it it just defies reason this notion that somehow because you've got Republicans that have tried to work together with President Trump in advancing an agenda for the American people that somehow\nOr because they they are responsibility for what is clearly fundamentally the responsibility of a range to a man\nWho set pipe bombs through the through the u._s. mail and and and a and a person filled with hatred\nWho them committed in my mind and I forget all act and so I mean look this is part of the media narrative you'd get it you understand it at some point it was always going to get here how is it that that folks in the media are going to figure out a way to try and blame Republicans to turn the election\nAnd I think you're I think you're seeing that now the question is whether it's going to work or not and I'm just I'm I'm not sure that will ... I mean I see the narrative out there I see a lot of people trying to make this case\nUh but I but I just don't see it I think at the end of the day it's election particularly on the house side\nIt's just going to be a whole lot closer than people think\nAnd you know we'll see what the outcome is but I ... I I I just think the American people are going to come back to the fundamentals here which are strong economy\nA lot of accomplishment that Republicans can rest their record on and you get a lot of Democrats running that are fundamentally out of touch\nAnd and I also believe always in the fundamental common sense of the American voter they realize if they don't like Donald Trump\nVoting for example for Christian cinema is not the response you you empower the responsible Republican Senate led by Mitch McConnell you don't empower radical left us\nAnd I think there is um a I'll call it the bounce back in fact people noticed when they use aspirin for example in the nasal congestion the more you use it the worse it gets the more he is crazy rhetoric the crazier get such a joy ... off with Jake Tapper last night's among Sanders David Urban onset as well\nGive a listen to this cut number six\n... I think you know the fact that at one of the things that ... really launched his presidential run on and talking about Islamic radicalization\nAnd how can it has radicalized so many more people than I have my dad I mean the way he talks the wasteful waste is access\nAnd that was that stop right there that was David Urban looking just amazed and perplexed as I did now she later apologized they stopped the show they let her come back and do a clean up on I'll be but none have when you get stuff like that you realize the Democrats are unhinged\nYeah I mean the problem with with where we are now is that you know we could all have a discussion about whether we would we like the president\nAt times to today take a different I think that's entirely appropriate critique but for some reason I think people on the left bully that allows them to do the things that are completely ridiculous and by the way she thought the only one is saying you know things like this notion of somehow\nA you know we we we we compare what's happening\nWith his lot Islamic terrorism abroad\nTo to some of what we see here in the act you're despicable make no mistake but trying to draw these comparisons trying to to use these parallels to attack the president of the Republican Party\nIs it's just all faith and I have to say I do think it is a function of the time we find ourselves then is that this rhetoric become acceptable\nWhen we play for you ah Marsha Blackburn had a rally yesterday but she began with a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh this is what happened cutting number

their rights Trump isn't to blame she writes his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nI think she accurately represents the ...\nAnd the media is point of view and that that is a Republican to most Americans what do you think senator\n... she knew that that kind of rhetoric is on and most Americans I don't know who described her as a but the only person to blame for the kind of horrific shooting we saw\nIn Pittsburgh on Saturday as shooter ... anti Semite um should be locked up for the rest of his life not put\nA white lies on the person that sent those suspicious packages last week of course the blame there just as hard for her Bernie Sanders all on pierce persona blind\nFor almost ... who knows how many other Republican congressman he would have killed her how to get her to brave Capitol Hill police officers\nLet me play for you the height of Trump's arrangements syndrome is Julia Ioffe off last night with Jake Tapper on CNN cut number six\n... I think you know the fact that at one of the things that's so clearly launched his presidential run on a ... of radicalization and has radicalized Sal many more people than I have a bad guy\nRight there she would later come back and apologize for that remark I Want to be fair to wear because they got hammered on the air when she said that but Tom Cotton that anyone could even give voice to that without stopping to show immediately in and said dismissing someone from the set is amazing to me [noise]\nYou as you remember this is the same woman who accused Donald Trump of\nSleeping with his daughter a couple of years ago um I Can't imagine that in a respectful journalistic outlet would walk pretty associated with someone like that [noise] a beast authors who met you I think sometimes they view themselves as the writers and there are and colonel morality play\n'em there Saturday inside the beltway New York buffalo except like amateur staff that a lot of Americans um for the president's agenda\nThey believe the economy is growing stronger cows wear your tax code on regulatory system that our military strong as ever and ever expected again\nIn the world and that may not play very well in the Upper East side of Manhattan and as the airlines but there are millions and millions of Americans across the country in places like Arkansas that actually do believe that they support the president's support the Republican Party and it's fine to ... like the campaign against us cod and went back to the white\nUm but ... is really a cult\nOr and I wonder how do we fix the media I think media is poisoning in America and I I Try and bring on left right and center and trying to be civil with everybody and you're always civil and all the Republicans are and John Kerry a civil and people are civil but\nSecuring your firearms photographs family heirlooms and other valuables whether you're buying their first safe or you just outgrown what you currently own stop by a Z liberty safer on match sales service and insulation\nChandler and Peoria ... liberty safe dot com easy liberty safe dot com\nHenri America walls your high Canada and greetings to my brand new affiliates here in Delaware I'm very very pleased with news radio fourteen ten WTO be into over hand news radio fourteen fifty W. I. L. M. in Wilmington have joined the board that is the newest show\nAbout Ninety percent of my voice back after another day of\nRest I'm so glad that that I got it back in time for the last year we got from the election and the Republicans are looking very very good in the Senate and they have a fighting chance in the house this is not the blue wave that had been forecast\nLater in the program we'll be joined by Senator Tom cotton to talk about outlooks on the Senate map and Marsha Blackburn who's going to be elected to the Senate in Tennessee she pulled away from two brothers some pretty significant way\nI don't think the Republicans are going to lose any seats\nI think Martha McSally is going to hold on to Jeff Flake seat fairly easily in Arizona it's all split her way and I've been looking at the internal models down there and I I Would expect her to win by six seven points\nUh Marsha Blackburn is pulled away double digit went in Tennessee Dean Heller it's much much closer and uh it's dog fight but he can do it he's very very likeable there in Nevada so they hold on to their fifty one to start with\nBen Kevin Cramer beats\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and nobody even argues that that's a double digit when Josh Hawley has pulled away from Claire McCaskill in Missouri Mike Braun has established a significant that statistically significant lead in Indiana that's three pickups then we get to the dead each Rick Scott in Florida against income and Bill Nelson\nAnd I think Governor Scott is helping themselves everyday by just being a great governor Matt Rosendale the author of Montana Jon Tester and that's one that's very very difficult to gas because of the polling has been so elusive very difficult to pull Montana the president's going back there and of course John tester\nVoted against Brett Kavanaugh and most of Montana likes the second Amendment rights\nJohn James's surging in Michigan Mike Pence was there yesterday Bob Haagen has pulled within five in New Jersey which is extraordinary and pat and more years on the show yesterday competitive in West Virginia though by it's going to be great and the Senate\nAnd then what happened yesterday a gift again because I had been under the weather I've spent a lot of time just watching and reading on my back every ... new book the corrosion conservatism I'm reading for later in the show today Jim ... new book I'm just reading lots of different stuff but I watch a lot of cable keep my eye on MSNBC box and then\nAnd yesterday when fall on\nThe left wing media went forward\nAnd it's in the Washington Post this morning\nIf you want to know a summary of what the left thinks about you if you're a center right motor if you're an independent or a Republican capital ramble for my college at the post war I write a column as well\nWrote a column saying that title which as Trump isn't to blame his entire party is it begins the White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump for our poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere\nAnd you know what rights capital ramble there right Trump isn't to blame his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed\nThe twenty sixteen election do you understand what that means that means Catherine Rampell writing on behalf of the entire left wing media establishment and the Democratic party thanks you are a murderer neo Nazi pipe bomb sending scum\nThat's what it means that is what they think of you\nAnd that's why I think they're going to get the surprise of their life again\nOn Tuesday night because Americans are not neo Nazi pipe bomb sending\nPeople they are deeply wounded\nGrieving with their friends in Pittsburgh but they do not know they may not be cover religion is but they are co citizens and they are rallying to them and they reject pipe bombs and they reject attacking senators and restaurants and they reject firing the shots in the Republican\nHeadquarters in ... County Florida they reject it all and the idea of attempting to assign that\nCrazy action of a tiny infant some little sliver of the three hundred and thirty million Americans to ordinary Americans is repulsive\nAnd they are going to vote that repulsion that revulsion\nThe polls meanwhile and by the way you can watch the clips I'm about to play over and give you a dot com we have a live stream from the studio and we have the clips ready for you in the meantime President Trump went on Laura Ingraham show last night on Fox News to talk about some of the recent rhetoric\nHere's what he first had to say about the mainstream media cut number one\nIt was a woman who shows CNN a short while ago saying that you have radicalized more people than I Would say in and say\nWell that must be some kind of a sick when the when I say the enemy of the people I'm Talking about the fake news and you know it is better than anybody the revenues out there that shows fake\nAnd I can do the greatest thing have or North Korea\nAs an example we would have been going to war normally would have been going to war with North Korea I think President Obama would have gone to war very theater next year he wouldn't be in right now a war with North Korea he told me it was by far and I'm not knocking them for that she says by far the biggest problem [noise] look at what we've done and yet when they talk about North Korea they say\nWhat's taking so long line anyway for Seventy some lawyers\nAnd they say I left I left Singapore\nWhere we had our meeting we really had a very good meeting relationship like that so much and\nThey said a new lens much thinking so long I see we're\nHelping fan here man to call them the enemy in the marriage the\nQuestion before we finish up with them then they said we can't get him on anything because the sanctions are wrongly got everything there is no missiles we got our houses back we have to remains company ... so now they said she met the new line is\nThat they're going to think of us have never going to be fair I think of the time [noise]\nOkay it's a new line I shouldn't have met you know and if you go back to before I got here\nWe going to war bad war with North Korea so\nIt was raining and I work for Reagan they call them stupid and the answer an incompetent a warmonger hang out with\nYou when you know he was\nHe didn't have a social media mature what if what he didn't have social meaning when they form of telling the truth is a problem\nWe have a lot of supporters you know that better than anybody when you have to do is look at your writings okay but you know better than anybody to support his you know the the line\nI watched meet the press this weekend\nWas so falsely putt putting words in people's\nHomily you in the mid term for this party that's going at it\nThat way and I'm getting twenty five and thirty thousand people to these rallies nobody's there has never been in his brain has never been anything like what's happening I went to Illinois ... knowing seven forty seven this massive hangar\nAnd how to use his second day for the overflow nobody seen and always look what happened to Ted Cruz is doing great now nephews and he's not doing anything even talk about that race than his opponent is\nSo they ... the president keeps going with Laurie anger and he he's not going to let up on the media attacking him cut number two you know I look\nWas he was insane a long time before you look at his medical records he was in Spain for a long time [noise] Bernie Sanders had\nWho shot the friends of ours ...\nWho is a total maniac nobody put his name in the headlines Bernie Sanders and the headline was a maniac\nPoliticized\nTime I was in the headlines of it Washington Post [noise] my name associated with this crazy bomber\nTrump bomb or something that I was in the headlines when they got him they didn't say mom are found they could not come in the headlines now\nThey didn't do that who has a Bernie Sanders when he didn't do that with the Democrats win for the people came out they didn't do that with President Obama with a church the horrible situation with the church that they put my name of the headlines\nWhen I say enemy of the people I'm Talking about this thing and it is fake which are in in my people on just one question so it was one of the Washington Post as a student at a place that I was you know we know within the\nFan fiction not above the crowd Mr Trump something to that effect and then it turned out that he can picture five hours before\nThe people coming into the arena Rena was\nCandid with thousands of people outside [noise]\nBut this is a kind of dishonesty that we have\nOne more cut because of president with Laura Ingraham last night is laying out the case I think it's going to motivate a lot of voters who are not even Trump supporters they understand the fundamental\nWrongness of blaming Donald Trump or his supporters for the neo Nazi you hated Trump who killed the eleven people in Pittsburgh they understand that the nut who's shut the pipe bombs\n... trying to do the opposite [laughter] it's a problem with our country when you look at that caravan and you probably largely very you know big percentage of men young strong [noise]\nA lot of bad people a lot of people in their people that are in gangs and you know what I'm In this country and they want to come into the country you have to apply like the other thing we have millions of people coming in fear of flying that coming and we have a very strong water I called up to the military this caravan is wasting their time they are not coming and\nGoing to be on the hill and the\nGuard\nAnd then I made this is Thomas ending up with a military this is the military and they're standing there and one thing that will only captured we'll let them out [noise] what has been happening and we're not as\nPretty recently were not letting him out what happens is we catch and release would catch it we're not releasing we're catching\nWere not releasing the went on to say there will be tense there will be\nNice sense but if they're not eligible for asylum they're going right back\nBy its um tend to be a flashpoint issue for the next week or what matters I say more is that Americans are revolted by the media is a sense of assigning them away and so the nutty terrible action of a pipe bomber
