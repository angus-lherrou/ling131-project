McChrystal because\nYou came to grips with the other side of the way and he was cruel to the people in slate and he broke his votes in the United states and so while we had what you call the extraordinary ability for war deeply mixed record\nThat's exactly right I mean I grew up literally wishing I could be Robert Daly but never thinking that I could achieve that level of performance or actual as but yet she really at two things first he lost now people can make excuses you didn't have as many soldiers or logistics\nBut he lost so if he was a CEO you judge that way but much more

this morning Florida's governor Rick Scott is calling in from the sunshine state\nGovernor Scott welcome in the first question is how is the recovery in the panhandle going\nWherever that a lot of people working really hard at our down to about twenty three thousand for some good morning I'll go ahead to better\nDown to about twenty two thousand people without power right now owns in businesses that power so for a goal is to get most everybody back on ... there'll be some pockets but people often left by um first of November the first part of the next weeks or work with our utility companies\nYou got to the lake National Guard our response I called up pulled out the number the national guard which can be used on them over the home and she'll send a card and\nSo we got a lot of work to do a yesterday I was with vice president Pence which was a good day because he came down to announce that the president is committed to rebuilding tend to air force base which is just\nTo the east of Panama City uh that is a got a great military presence\nCut a two and a half billion dollar impact on our local economy there to ... about twenty thousand jobs so that was a big deal we went to a\nChurch that was providing\nA really nice lunch to our National Guard the coast guard members and families from ten they'll so you know we're working hard every day and it's going to take a while but\nFor the ... we've had these hurricanes with or add one last year we come back even we build stronger people love to live in Florida we've got the nicest people helping each other down here and got so many people coming from all over the country a serving food helping people parks on the house it's an it's really nice\nYou know I've got a lot of support for to murder but Khan over the last couple of weeks here because they they put down and do the heavy lifting I'm sure you run into him but that Kendall announcement is huge Chuck tighten our talking when the hurricane hit\nHow homestead never came back after Andrew twenty five years ago and sort of get the confirmation from the president the vice president DOD that ... is coming back that's a big deal to everyone in that community\nIt's a big deal and the truth is they they need to come back it sorts of military mission you know we we don't have the drilling in the eastern half of the ah the eastern part of the Gulf there and that allows a our military cheap test um\nThat's different um because of the cordless aid they can do a lot of training there which is where you know where the air force and maybe that's where your training to learn to be a pilot\nAnd so they can do it on I interrupted by a commercial activity there so it's it's an important a mission for the for the United states we have twenty military bases and reunify command\nAnd as governor of trying to do everything I can to help them fulfill their mission and make sure all the military members editor veterans have all the resources they need to ... everybody want to live in the state\nNow now governor Rick Scott let's turn to politics or I've heard it's sad that you would be running away with the Senate race but for the fact\nMichael wiped out the voting ability of many Floridians in the panhandle I read an executive order you set out our ... going to be able to vote because they want to send you to Washington as their senator they really do want to replace Bill Nelson I Want to send you but they got to be able to vote and you know there aren't any school to go to\nA huge ... what was done is we had eleven counties impacted and selling some impact a little bit less like a with a state capitals Leon county\nSo we sat down with their supervisors elections there ... or by county\nAnd we said how how can we work with you to make sure you know people have the right to vote and they can get out there so you can vote by absentee or by mail um in our state or\nYou can do it by early voting and you can do it on election day and we worked in every county to make sure of that you can get off the boat to what they did in Lake County which is Panama City\nThey have five of supervise election wanted to do there have sought by big mega sites 'cause that's where we got\nA more damage where there's a lot of people and so the supervisors doing of elections down there is doing TSA um and just making sure everybody gets off the boat and and clearly you know campaigns will go and make sure people know where to vote because\nYou know what happens a lot of people they wake up on election day and say okay I'm going to go vote and they just go to the last place they loaded onto a lifestyle and so there are everybody's working hard to let people know that he might have to be going to a different place\nAnd so how do you feel about the campaign right now I I look at the CPI average three of the last four polls have you had but you're busy during hurricane recovery it's not really campaign mode and Rick Scott style which is a hundred and ten percent or how you juggling the effects\nBut my first job is to take their I'm going to get on the governance okay like that it's been so that's what I've been doing\nMy wife has gone a ending campaign for me I when I had wanted to run back into it and she says that score eight honey but I hate public speaking I'm scared to death well she was horrified speeches a die hard and has done a great job a so she's working there but here's why we're going to let\nIt actually becomes evident when you see her and so in her ... here's the difference between the two of us I haven't been in the panhandle and been in this county generally three or four county today\nMy opponent did three or four days a photo ops and he says oh there's nothing else I can do I wanna go back to campaign he's a quarter and everybody knows that he doesn't want to work he's out of workers'\nI'm I Am and so people see that and they're losing we're going to win is they've watched for eight years but I sat there and everyday whatever whether whatever's going on I showed up and make my job she does all of a sudden\nIt can't it actually running ads saying one thing he's done nothing on education nothing on the environment nothing on transportation there's one thing and it's become evidence\nAnd so he's the biggest things apple of why we have trauma he's done nothing in forty two years in ... in public office\nForty two years wow you know and and the whole astronaut thing I actually thought he was an astronaut until someone informed me that he hitched a ride on a shuttle because he's on appropriations I really didn't think he was an answer I ... I think it's one of those things that gets into the public psyche\nAnd they think he went through the whole program and all that stuff and I'm just amazed that this is my living right I don't know that so Governor Scott what what's your agenda going to be in D.C what do you want to bring to DC\nWell here's here's will give you and I'll give me why okay I grew up in a family I don't know my dad I Lived in public housing going out and I watched my mom struggled those food on the table get healthcare it all the struggles that people have so when I became governor\nMy goal was to say the the three most important things to family or one got a job\nTo your children have to have a great education because that's the chancellor the train and number three you got to live in a safe community changes it a little bit when you go to Washington but it's uh\nSaying what do we do to to make the heck harming better for everybody what do we do to have an education system and most of the education issues are going to be done at the state level and how do we keep people safe at the federal level more but it's going to be tied tied to the military\nUm and so my my journey it's I think about every family and how you make every family in America in better position\nAnd so I think it's I think if they caught at the federal level it's gonna be economy and sort of be how do we make sure we defend the end of this country\nThat Governor I always tell people I Lived in California and took two years ago I moved to Virginia to most diverse places in the country or Florida and California you've got lots of demographics ... to a greater a pest eastern parts of California and the Central Valley not particularly diverse\nBut how do you but you do very well with the Cuban community the Latino community Puerto Rican community the African American community the or the Asian American community do very well in every community why is that\nI show up it's a simple as that I show up and in my eyes I tell everybody\nI leave the sitting governor of the state I'm going to ... I and so so ... so I'm going to focus on issues that are oh gee I Know I Know for the Cuban their ... year yet here he is over with ... bomber incident building also did with regard to Raul Castro\nIs waiting ... theories that their country has basically been decimated by by a ... and the Nicaraguan fusion what happened um with are taking what he's killing peaceful protesters and then with regard to Puerto Rican\nWhen they had Maria I showed up the next eight times we've got resources we caught 'em I sent them high which all ... National Guard um utility workers just show up and do your job and take care of everybody and you do people say look like I cared about me maybe perhaps\nWe could we could use that and some other campaigns governors got it looks like you're surging it looks pretty good right now so last question what's your feeling about between the last you know we've got ten days down now it's only ten days out\nA alligator professional wrestler in Ford has sent\nThese packages one President Trump that is right in my Bernie Sanders for the guy shot the baseball field it's all crazy to assert that sort of thing\nAnd it is important that people stop trying to assign blame and and I think average Americans just think it's silly\nAnd so we don't know anything about who sent this it's like I was a bribe and Gabby Giffords was tragically shot and my my friend guy Bentsen was filling in for me that day and he began a line that is used over and over and over again let's just wait for the facts\nAnd I I Am a hundred percent with the let's just wait for the fact uh instead of Jen Psaki with Jake Tapper yep say cut number four place\nAnd I also think that President George W. Bush would have done something different in passing kinda want it done something different\nAnd President George Bush would have done something\nI think what we're saying here and there are moments that really has\nLeadership and whether they have the moral leadership\nIronically given his statement to leave the country and Donald Trump has failed repeatedly he sells when it came to Charlottesville he felt he fails when it came to the hurricane\nAnd this is another failure to bring the country together President Obama certainly would have handled it differently there are times when you put partisanship aside and you try to bring the country together it's not just in this opportunity and dangerous mess after him because they just escalating adults only probably going to get worse if he doesn't change the town\nI'm telling you Democrats are going to go backwards because of this will watch this show us from doing it and they just reach\nSo much about [noise]\nYou're in the middle of a nonstop action packed information the Hugh Hewitt is coming right back\nWhen it comes to meat quality matters that's why I made the switch to butcher box but your boss ships free right to your door every month and their meat is guaranteed humanely raise\nNo antibiotics for hormones ever ... grass fed and grass finished their chicken is organic and free range\nTheir heritage pork is far from that other white meat they sure are barred from pigs re educate their fat and play with or whether it's supposed to make cuts in qualities are impossible to find in stores butcher box also comes at a competitive price\nAnd get a month's worth of delicious made from what your box for less than six bucks or mail you won't find any better deal I'm praying my quality meat like this anywhere else\nExperienced the butcher box difference for yourself is it what your box dot com slash you can get twenty dollars off plus for a make a comment that free make it on your first walk this opera assume that's butcher box dot com slash shoot for twenty dollars are free begun\nButcher box dot com slash you this is a huge huge\n[laughter]\nAnd I think the new one of\nThe news they're all forces wanting to just another suspicious packages and discovered this time in Florida for those two Democratic\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey in fact the FBI is turkey you know the ... in ...

nice to see the patriots dots on\nFor secretary of health and Human Services Alex ... is our who joined me inside the beltway I'm In the early ... is our welcome\nBack I Want to talk to you about drug pricing and good morning to you but I had to visit the pharmacy this week for the Z pack and all the other stuff that goes when you get bronchitis a tell me and I was little sticker shock that I've got an insurance what were you in the president talking about yesterday about lowering drug prices\nWell he great to be with you again ah yesterday morning here at ha chess we actually revealed data showing that in one of the most important parts of our drug program Medicare pays one hundred and eighty percent\nOf what Europeans and Japanese pay for the same medicines\nUnder deals that farm it gives them and the president came over here to ha jets and he said that's going to stop that for a free ride into the stock we're ... we're going to be done without paying sticker price and that part of the Medicare program and we're going to get the benefit of these foreign prices here in America\nAnd it'll save Seventeen billion dollars over five years for the program and three and a half billion over five years for patients like you when you get your drugs\nNow six days are I Want people to know your very find a lawyer you are and what we call a litigator having clerked for the white honorable Michael ... am I correct about that\nIndeed I was his first Locklear\nOkay so I Want him to be our next attorney general but it was a litigator you all have concern for what the statute permits you to do and whether the regulations which will go up through the nose for comment ... are going to be labeled an overreach and you know the big farmers spends a hundred and Seventy one million bucks so you're a lobbying so you're going to get\nA zillion comments during the notice income and face when do you think\nAre without pre judging the outcome ha chess will be able to issue a regulation from\nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid innovation to implement this proposal\nAre planning to have this up and running by the end of twenty Nineteen so the end of next year or the beginning of twenty twenty\nWe're going to take input but let me be I Want to be really clear view we're going to be doing this\nWe're going to get input to do it the right way but we're going to end of this foreign free riding that's not debatable it's gonna it's gonna happen but we'll do it the right way and we're doing it open and transparent process to ensure we're seeing around corners and doing everything right because we want to make sure this works for hospitals want to make sure it works for\nFor our providers for our doctors and want to make sure absolutely it worked for patients and will do whatever it takes\nTo make it work for all of them so they save money they have access and we stopped us for free riding and and how far is taking advantage of us\nNow senator ... is our agree with all that but I go back to the fact I think by the time your regulars out and into the courts Chevron doctrine will have been greatly limited so I expect the Supreme Court to look very very closely at the statute under which you are proceeding\nHave you already done that as a litigator and can and persuaded yourself but you got the authority to do what essentially it looks like a referencing tomato midpoint averaging like the real clear politics average of drug prices and implement that as the will buy price per Medicare\nBut that that that's correct you know um I actually have through a what's called the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation\nExtremely broad authority to test alternative methods of making payments in Medicare\nTo improve patient quality access and affordability and efficiency of the program that's why this is a demonstration project that will take place in fifty percent of America it has very clear metrics to be studied through it\nI have not the least bit of concern about our legal authority to do this to do this project\nThat's very good to know which ... now what about the Americans are on the other fifty percent of the country they're not going to be happy [laughter]\nWell you know I'm using as you just said I'm using the full authority that I've got I Do have to test a proposition I Can't just do it across the board for everyone now if Congress like this idea that can do it tomorrow across America I'm and I'm happy to work with them if they're interested in that\nUp but for the rest of Americans who are not in the fifty areas there's a fifty percent of the country that will be doing this they're still going to see a benefit because as we the way the system works as we pulled out in the reimbursements in this fifty percent of America\nThe silly way that we currently fixed prices in this program will also pulled down the reimbursements as a result in the other fifty percent of the country not as much but they will still get some of that benefits\nYears and I can tell you from personal experience they really do pay more for your clients\nDon't be fooled by other dealers who claimed to pay the highest prices it's usually just a ploy to get you into their office so they can trade you up to coins that are heavily mark dump it may seem like these other dealers are offering to pay more but in reality they're overcharging you want to trade American federal will always give you a from cash prize when buying your coins then if you want to purchase\nOld silver or other kinds you'll buy them at American federal wholesale price\nNo inflated claims just true top dollar before you accept an offer anywhere else Paul Americans had ... billion for eight oh five five three fifty two eighty two that for eight oh five five three sixty to eighty two American federal dot com that's American federal ... top [noise]\nGetting better by the hour as if it's we're playing with seasons\nUnder a hailstorm of drugs actually this is iPad bronchitis was a nasty thing and learned to follow that but\nIt's over it's done and I'm so glad to be with your voice the one good thing about lying around all day and doing nothing is it ... to drive deep into the numbers as we approach the election\nUh and of course talking about the packages I'm a ... that story is actually become\nUm pardon the pun overblown\nBecause there's nothing to report it's a bad thing that someone sent ten packages\nWhich were intended to go off as far as I can tell I'm not sure they were capable of going off but once you say that and you say the FBI is narrative searched Florida\nWith some focus on New York that's the end of the facts\nTherefore any conclusion there after all ... and I've got a lot so we can go to the point of view but let me go through the news first anti the great shirt I took her out Joseph Ellis who is joining us the author of you know founding brothers and many other wonderful books he has a a new book out called American dialogue with honors and as\nA a dog that adjusts caught a lot of course it's friday we live in Hillsdale dialogue this week we're going to do it a double\nPunch in

from Michael and all that sort of course about the campaign is well\nA lot to add I'm looking for really talking about Alex or about how they're gonna pull up the drug pricing reform\nOne of the big sponsors of our program and citizens for truth in drug pricing them and they approached me about ... come on and I don't like big pharma\nBig pharma spend a hundred and Seventy one million dollars a year to lobby to protect\nThe prophet rather more that is the United states I I like to pig farmer for what they do\nI don't like the way they ...\nI think they can do a lot more R and D\nAnd produce a lot more drugs if they didn't spend so much time on advertising so much time on\nAnd I really do resent what they did in Obamacare they carved out for themselves a protectorate\nLet everyone gets screwed by President Obama\nAnd the collapse of health care system that followed Obamacare there were still climbing out of so do not bully big pharma when they tell you they're they're fighting for
