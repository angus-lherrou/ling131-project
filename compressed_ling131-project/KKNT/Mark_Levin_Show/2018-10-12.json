Institute and aid to the eye and the ... just shot up and I also\nBut it could just see the problem coming right and I wrote a column for the union Tribune\nBack in two thousand and fifth chewing when this was proposed and of course accused of being a racist\nOr by now we see all these sorts of problems so we've got a thousands of a a voter registration so you know the the DMV reported last month that it'd be twenty three thousand voter registration errors resulting from\nWhatever they they blame it on other Fifteen hundred ballots\nAre potentially a you know mistakenly registered by the DMV a DMV insistent no illegal illegal immigrants have gotten them but it looks like some potentially some non citizen trucks\nThat are driving these these power and then we're the LA Times look at a software that either may have been Seventy seven thousand voter records that were misreported\nSeventy ... what's your excuse me Seventy seven thousand\nSeventy seven thousand that were misreported to the DMV and some cases are allowing duplicate valid and other cases um the envy seems to inexplicably have changed the party registration of some voters so we've just we've just got a total mad\nAnd uh you know it's become it's a big scandal that even the Democratic controlled California's somewhat of a scandal and the\nUh you know again the DMV insists that uh you know illegal residents voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against a backdrop of you know what the real id law\nWhich is the federal law mandating you know new driver's license is set to vote people provide a you know a information for the security on airplanes we've got these enormous backlogs\nAnd the DMV but he's had these huge commercial license backlogs of the drivers would go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks\nTo be in control of a voter records and then the law and it was passed in two thousand and Fifteen one of the big problems was um you know it had some amendments to it um\nWhere you're not a lot where really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the the immigration status of the of the person uh you know who who's been register\nAnd in the law said if a person as a quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California or new voter motor voter program that person's registration chubby presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get\nRegistered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault so it it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprise DMV may have registered non citizen voters Steven I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens giving drivers' licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure\nWhat the right to carry it and I'm not you know my views on immigration are really quite you know quite a torch I lean towards bloody as many people and that's that's possible are provided they follow some rules so I'm not exactly you know some kind of\nImmigration restriction is them yeah I I get it to we all get it right\nNow uh again if somebody who's an illegal alien inadvertently gets registered to vote and she er she votes what happens to that person\nWell according to the law nothing nothing zoom that a ... and less as much I guess you'd have to prove that they didn't show will fully but you know they basically when they passed the motor voter laws and I I'm against those in general\nBecause a book if you can't go through the trouble of of the mine up process of registering there maybe you're not uninformed ... you're not to be voting ... and the state but states low turnout we're very low turnout it's caused by a lot of things that ...\nYeah maybe it's the fact that maybe the fact that there there are two are knowledgeable

in the sheriff said he was there for the next several hours is Martha way back when the next week I'm\nWarning tonight if you are African American whatever you do do not become a Republican because if you do the Democratic party is going to try to check you into a mental hospital\nThey are going to say that you were an educated they are going to say that you clearly are not well mentally\nThe same people that say that we don't need to shame people and we don't need to bully people the same Democratic Party that says we don't need a shame people and we need to let people be open about mental illness and we need to bring it out and not make it something that people should be embarrassed about are the same exact people today\nThat are shaming African American man because\nHe didn't do what they told him to do\nI'm going to bring up an analogy here and I know people are going to get mad at me for doing it so before you freak out and start tweeting at me or sending me messages on Facebook listen to what I actually have their say through the end of this comment before you lose your mind and I mainly talking to liberals that are listening because we know they're listening\nDemocrats are upset\nThat a black\nMan by the name of Kanye West is not supporting the people that they told him\nTo support thinking about that\nAnd when he supported the president they first said he was an Uncle Tom\nThen they said we would we would we would shame him health shame him and just saying that he's mentally on well clearly this is the person that's mentally on well then they said the president's taken advantage of a mentally on well man\nThen you had people on TV\nWho are African American who went on TV and said this about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow they'll read\nYou've heard of that right I'm going to play it again this is what African Americans who are Democrats set on national\nTV about Kanye West because Kanye West disagrees with them politically so now they just really him by saying it was what happened when they grow they'll read\nYou've heard that right Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\n\nAll because Kanye West likes Donald Trump\nNow here's my analogy when I Know there's going to be people on the left or they're going to freak out by me saying this and before you again don't tweet at me until after I finished the statement because if you tweet at me before I finished the statement I Will not respond because clearly you're ignorant and you're not listening\n\nIs is not the perfect example of a modern day version of slavery\n\nWhat they're doing the Kanye West is this a perfect example\nOf what slave owners did two slaves to keep them\nIn their lane of slavery\n\nTony west as a black guy Kanye West's back in the day said George Bush hates black people\nRemember that\nMr producer can you grab that audio do you mind doing that\nCounty West was a guy that after Hurricane Katrina came out on national TV at a fundraiser instead George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not leading then there wasn't a black Democrat in America\nWhen he said that that would have said this afterwards tell you what happened when do we\nThink about that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read if I Would argue that as an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from because sellers\nNow in ... west said this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of off George Bush doesn't care about black people [noise]\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when negroes don't read snow you didn't hear it you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou will get what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans\nIt is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools and when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no because\nWe got employees that are black working in the schools in where unions as teachers and you can't destroy Republicans ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done it\nPossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left I Would argue the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that keeps them on their plantation that keeps them in modern day slavery and so what happened was as you have a I\nI'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro\nOn a plantation mismanagement once your point that audio again this is kind of us who are living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great white man who's calling out white present and it was okay to say that on that were on that day because that was the words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation\nThen the guy was comes out and county I start singing for himself and search realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I Am seeing massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm saying are kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party\nHe starts questioning the rich black guys\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no you need to stay in poverty because won't take care of you there don't you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you come up with that idea because we don't even expect you to have an id how racism that mentality and then ... says you know what I\nI'm going to be independent I Am independent thinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate at all time low [noise] I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs African American community and set up offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then they reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation\nWas what happened when he grows they'll read how is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist 'cause the black person said is it not racist because it's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's tweets are are are are horrible\nThe same Democrats who say that Donald Trump bullies people it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets\nAbout this being national coming out day for the gay and lesbian transgender bisexual community and that we should love every one if you get off their plantation they'll say this to you is what happens when they grow they'll read\nThere it is\nDon't tell me\nThat the Democratic party cares about black people\n\nDon't tell me that this isn't racism don't tell me that this is not slavery modern day slavery\nYou shut up you sit down in the back of are blocked by us and our block party and our Democratic Party and you're saying what we tell you to say and what you're going to say is George Bush hates black people and you're brilliant but if you ever get out of that lane\nIf you ever get off our plantation and try to make a name for herself or have independent thoughts we will go out on national TV and we will bully you and we will tell people that you're mentally unfit\nYou're mentally insane you are mentally incompetent you then to a hospital before for mental health issues clearly the white man's taking advantage of you all and by the way you're an ignorant black person to tell you what happens when they grow they'll read\nOne eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven been Ferguson filling in for the great when Marco then let me go to ... thinks are waiting you are on the market then show hello\nHow are you doing buddy doing well sir you know it's a shame because all over the TV today and I'm In Staten Island New York which is you know it's it's I Would say it's probably about Ninety percent Trump world right here in Staten Island\nOf what the rest of New York is terrible but I'm watching TV and every place feeling this kid\nA change on a lot on his medicine or that it's horrible it's going against the African Americans um he can't get a break uh it's just it's despicable what to do with the guy now because it's a Trump fan and it's it's horrible but these people do [noise]\nIt misses this is the public shaming and the assault which is exactly what he's explain what explains so well\nI mean you you look at the last week he read two celebrities that have gotten into politics right you had you had Taylor Swift to comes out for a Democrat when says she's terrified of Congress woman running for Senate in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn\nAnd it terrifies her what would she what she would do if she got elected to the U.S Senate\nAnd Democrats came out and said this is a brave\nIndependent woman they throw around the woman card right this is what is that brave independent woman she's brave she's a real model every woman should or should we should look at her and teach your children\nAnd your daughters and your and your grandkids to be like hey we're short because this is what a strong brave role model of a woman looks like then comes out for Donald Trump and now he's a token eager and that doesn't lead he's mentally ill he's an Uncle Tom\nTerrible and and and the things that these guys they say about ... and it's it's really really bad I mean it's on believable it's like they want to vote and they want to institutionalize
