got a real elephant in the room here dealing with their credibility for almost two weeks\nThe Saudi leadership has maintained\nBecker size or exit at the cost for the day he arrived in the conflict by a backdoor provided no evidence to this\nTo support that whatsoever and they and an obvious that you were saying there was no foul play well now we know there is foul play ... and that brings a lot of credibility to what they've been talking about for two weeks it begs the question\nWhat kind of an investigation or we're gonna get will it be accurate I Want to be credible and that's why I'm

Saudi Arabia they had been helping in dealing with Iran the number one sponsor terror they're afraid of Iran so we do have some common interests\nSo the president is considering all of this being

ago\nThat Chris Matthews has revealed the gigs\nMost white people will not vote for racist but but but Van Jones says the reason for the Trump won is because of white flash a bunch of white people who weren't racists concerned about the changing nature of the country but Chris Matthews assumes saying most white people wouldn't vote for somebody if they're racist [noise]\nYou know as I said in the

single Democrat you entered the question whether or not they greet with Diane Feinstein that the Kavanaugh investigation should be reopened\nThose old safer ISIS is being destroyed you know President Trump asked a question and twenty six thing horn yeah the Lewis and most people said not much they saw no hold with Hillary Clinton let me tell you twenty Eighteen it's Democrats take over you got a lot to lose and I want every Democrat is running for the Senate to answer the question\nDo you agree with Diane Feinstein that which and reopen the Kavanaugh investigation that Democrat I Want to

page Kevin Oh\nThese answers to lead a lot about the person running so they need to argue with Diane or not are you with the American people the American thing for please that we've got a good conservative justice they're ready to move on\nAnd regarding Kevin our in our left wing academia hundreds of professors are demanding that the honorary degree that Susan Collins has acquired over the years be revoked here's what Jonathan Turley set about it\nI should say what about that I too am a graduate of St Lawrence university um I Know they said that Susan Collins with the most famous credit and I would say that trail on but also they got more than a than Kirk Douglas or Eleanor Mondale all of these people went to St Lawrence and I would also say that\nI've heard from many individuals and there are many people who support her and who do not agree with that sentiment and that's all I'm not a letter or that faculty letter\nUm but that being said this is a very strong letter and it basically says that they want to remove one of the two honorary degrees that she got because essentially they don't like the conclusion\nShe makes China [noise] that's right and what's the most disconcerting I assign you a almost a hundred protesters from virtually every department in university signing this letter\nSome are so everything's just like a [noise] but there are hardcore facts about how things who's being responsible and who's not Senate and the challenges making sure that voters are aware of that and then hold elected officials accountable\nWere they concerned about Obama's quote unquote cozy relationship with MSNBC hall and their house\nFor example\nAfter the two thousand eight election there was a town hall Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell who was a an ardent

we'll hold down the foreign forty for the next three hours tonight as a bunch of immigrants are heading to\nAmerica on purpose advertising it with cameras into which chanting ... yelling and screaming and Donald Trump is now the bad guy because he threatened to defend our country\nHe threatened to send the military to protect our country I Want you to think about how the media is framing this today I've been I've been watching this all day long and I just keep sitting there and I'm actually the point now I'm not even mad about it just it just becomes so comical it's it's it's so literally I can tell you what they're going to say before they say\nSo in a normal world in a normal [noise]\nWorld that we shouldn't be living in the headlines should read if you're being intellectually honest president United States America promises to protect America\nBy making sure that people can't break in the country legally it would be like a good thing right I get like a good headline it'd be the equivalent of dad puts doors on our locks on doors to protect family from criminals who are planning to come break into your house you would be treated as a hero\nBut this is how mess up of the world we live and going in this mid term elections were were Donald Trump actually protecting our borders he's now quote threatening people\nThis is part of the we're going to try to make Donald Trump work on hand just point seven point oh eight point a Nineteen point out whatever I don't even know what number we're on now I mean the ... on him sign is so often the huge now it's just it's become a joke\nSo the headlines are that Donald Trump is threatening like he's the agitator he's the aggressor he's the evil one he's the main one he's the unhinged willing to sit in the military to stop a migrant caravan ... that has the purpose of breaking laws in this country\nYou don't have to understand the the the what what these migrant caravans are doing these are illegal immigrants who are chanting and saying I'm coming to break into America and you're not gonna stop me\nIt's no different than someone saying we're coming to your neighbor headed we're going to break in your house and we're still yourself it's not any different than that it's the same intense\nWe're going to come into your country we're going to take your jobs are going to have kids they were going to steal your health care we're gonna make you pay for it and you will not stop us and we finally have a president says ahah yeah I Will hold my Diet Coke\n\nCan't make beer jokes anymore after cabinet member that's now off limits president Donald Trump said he would send the military to block the migrant care of and headed to the United states Porter\nI must say the strongest of terms asked to Mexico to stop this onslaught\nAnd if an able to do so I Will call of US military and close our southern border Trump said on Twitter today now this is where Trump of course became on hand just as Mrs unconscionable what he's doing to close their southern border how could you do such a thing\nAgain in a normal world where they normal media the president the United states of America the headline would actually look like and read Don president United States America defends lawlessness\nAcross the border and Mexico and puts Mexico on notice that if they don't stop these illegal immigrants from coming across into this country that will cause the southern border to protect our nation's interest\nAnd and it would be ... by All right because this is what a normal president does this ... what a normal mother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than putting a locking your door having a fence around your house\nHaving a a alarm system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up\nTo protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\nNow all of this I say to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from art before or many of you know me I I play tennis and college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country as a student with a student\nVisa legally they didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws that make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do at the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break in your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation says\nYou know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter going to a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out there will be a very strong response\nFrom this country to Saudi Arabia more than words member don't transformation of actions outwards when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using his compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough on this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person they should calm down it should be loving which one is it\nTo the media which one is if you want to president that defends his country and fight for the country's interests who like he's doing with these illegal immigrants campaigning to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing it saying he's ... he's crazy and he's mean and even when he was so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person to listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freak out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrage is have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not and realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure did they just sort of how women to drive and the only reason they allowed women to drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they were cut off legs they were cut off feet\nAs part of punishment they were getting lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing so they will throw people in prison who are dissidents are to criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia
