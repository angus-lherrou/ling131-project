{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "That should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy\nOkay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women who were studied and they found that the number one in a non combat reason that people died in the navy was due to the melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study\nYou know I I kind of pot right there I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of shift\nIn the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful you know you're young or a isn't the end they're developing skin\nCancer but that I read on and I said most of\nThem were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went home it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream ... three formula help with that\nYet critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a quandary thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting ... physically and then it's a lack of\nFlexibility play you start to stiffen up and you feel it had night especially if you're in bad role in from side to side he'll wake up with your knees are hurting your legs are wrestling with your shoulders hurt\nThat said this in a setting in the ... with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula so here's someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball and pain muscle pain fibromyalgia\nI Would say on my formula like immediately and start thinking one or two of my ... three's a day\nFor the first week or two to get your thoughts as up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that the theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing it's not what you take it for what your body absorb\nOne I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy your sleep your outlook your mood and then after being for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's\nKind of like a little bit younger Christ\nAnd who wouldn't want that and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of result to be seen\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and it was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and his blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid result\nIn by getting Dr ... three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offered this only available to you listeners today so when you do call pleased to be sure to mention

you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three so\nHow about if folks to me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf the formula is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body's still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin these\nThree is the activated form so it's ready to go to work now the the three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a laugh or the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof or shouldn't be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nI Would definitely start with kids short developments\nAnd the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and\nWomen in their thirties you're talking about health immunity cardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important\n... people in their forties so I you know you start hanging morals aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your car on and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start feeling that you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over sixty I just wish that every senior citizen would go on a formula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done areas\nOf clarity you know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pink is such that your fast melt do three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath all in the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from lack of the vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like that\nAnd the sooner you can get on my formula better you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high mobility life from here on off\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and documenting is what can somewhat expect when they start taking your fast melts de three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first several days that something is changing your body because the kick start so many different cycles and your body that you'll start having less Shane having more energy\nAnd having that are meant so clarity better sleep erodes can be affected by this vitamin D three is necessary\nTo get these things run\nWell Dr biggest slum fortunately we only have a few minutes left to anything else you want to share with her audience here in our final minutes\nFor those of you listening covered a lot of our own working with the body is tricky as you know and\nWe're talking to your listeners have your show\nYou know there are all walks of life but all various conditioned and so I'm trying to get some good health that might cure for it and get yourself out of it get yourself on its formula and see for yourself in the law for you to try something that works\nThat's just an interesting thought we\nWere talking about nutrition we're not talking about rocket science or write a lot of science behind what I'm Talking about the key is is to get on a formula and give it a month or two\nEvery day take one of the Senate and start the improvements and you're paying your blood pressure your blood sugar energy or sleep out of this is my appeal to your listeners to get on its formula to try it for themselves\nWell Dr bank is again thank you for taking time to uh to be with us today thank you Chris\n... folks will here is your final opportunity if you want to try Dr ... says vitamin D three formula there's a

are happening out there in the world of a ... and the economics that we're all facing okay so um I Am a pasta lover I don't know how many of you out their love pasta but\nAh who doesn't like past I guess is what I should say over three hundred and fifty known pasta shapes folks believe it or not out there that you could have a different dish for dinner just about every day of the year well this past Wednesday October seventeenth\nThat was the official day to celebrate pasta so hopefully you guys went out and had some pasta I Know I didn't I just loved it I have my favorite restaurants that I go to for pasta of course I was a part of town you know I still am part Italian and my grandmother on my mother's\nSide she used to make all her own pasta she was an amazing cook and we used to go over there every Sunday we spend just about all day there we can get there in the morning we'd have breakfast my grandfather cook breakfast\nThen my grandmother would be in the kitchen rolling out the pasta for lunch and then we take our little break and then we'd have pasta for dinner [laughter] because I loved it it was fantastic I miss those days but of course uh that's why I found my favorite Italian restaurants that I go to which I Love\nTo have my pasta at when I go to those [noise]\nAll right so as I said each week we do a mention our weekly widow and a last week's riddle was or what rock group has four members but neither of them sing the answer is Mount Rushmore of folks that\nGroup right there for a car rings in Iraq and well\nNeither of them saying so I was a fun little rental this week's riddle and again you'll get this each and every week if you do sign up for our weekly economic update is what's the longest word in the dictionary what is the longest word in the dictionary so hopefully there's some of your out there that are already know the answer to that\nPart of it from this past week we did of course as I mentioned we had a volatile week we're going to talk about that in the next segment a but getting to Iran mosque of Tesla he had his fraud settlement with the SEC and that was approved by a judge so this is interesting as far as a test for this concern\nUm the I guess that she sees approving the settlement that they came to the arrangement of the settlement now with that though a mosque also came out this week and said he is wanting to buy twenty million dollars worth of stock usually when\nA someone announces that they've a ... they would announce that they've purchased stock not that they're going to purchase doctor says an unusual announcement and that's why many people feel that Iran mosque is probably not the right person to be head of tests well he's a very creative and innovative individual obviously\nA and and should have a very ... you know roll a big role in Tesla but when it comes to actually being the front spokesperson for the company ... thinking he probably should not be that person\nOr I folk so I'm going to talk a little bit about Social Security in the upcoming um next segment as well there's been some changes to Social Security and they also want to talk briefly about when it comes to planning\nFor those of you out there whether you're in the early stages of your financial career in other words maybe you just received a ... year first real good job you're out of college now and you\nHave that first position and now you're wondering what can I be doing to start putting money away for my future well I Would\nHope but I Know that many of us out there in our fifties or sixties or seventies if we had the chance to do things over again we probably would when it comes to our finances we would have done some things differently why because many people out there today are thinking well gee do I have enough\nTo retire or those who are already retired or thinking it would have been nice to have a little bit more possibly than I Do today and and they look back and they say well I could have done this I should have known that\nI shouldn't have done this\nAnd that's understandable but we are as individuals we have to go through life and we've got to make these mistakes that's how we learn\nAnd hopefully a we can also in part our piece of wisdom whatever that is whether that's in any industry they may be that we're in or or maybe whether it's the coaching a children whatever it may be and you or whatever your passion is\nUm but we want to hopefully allow others to learn from our mistakes as well so when we talk about things on this show if you're a younger individual out there and you're just getting started in your career and starting to try to put money away for your future\n[noise] listen closely to the things that we talk about on this show and listen closely to your elders and your parents and your uncles and you're answering your grandparents and and older friends that you may have why because they've been through things\nUh that you haven't experienced yet now I'm not saying that you will experience everything they have maybe you want but\nHave you gone to a major financial crisis in this economy that we've seen back in two thousand and seven and eight how did that affect\nA certain people versus you who's just now getting started you probably didn't even understand or realize what had happened back then so many people lost their\nTheir livelihoods they lost their jobs they lost their homes they lost investments they lost everything in some cases and had to start over again so we would hope that you wouldn't make that type of mistake and how do you avoid that\nWell number one is is that we have to of course understand whenever we're investing in anything out there we want to understand the risks and that was the big issue that was facing many people back in the last financial crisis\nRight when that market collapsed as it did many people were overextended they had borrowed money\nOr to purchase a maybe a second or third home they took equity from their personal residents\nTo borrow that money to go by another piece of property or to invest it in some other area or to just buy toys with it possibly well hope what we wouldn't make that mistake again as we did see a recovery in the real estate market\nHopefully folks are allowing that equity to build up in their home so that at some point in the future\nYou'll be able to retire and not have a mortgage payment right that's up to a goal for many people and as it should be and ultimately that can really make a big difference in retirement when it um helps you to understand you don't have that mortgage payment\nOr in retirement and there's less uh expense that you have in order to cover those other important needs that you're going to have whether it's higher medical bills\nOr or maybe some additional vacation money you'll have in retirement so there's music got to take a short break right\nNow folks when we come back from the break we're going to continue the conversation of talk a little bit about this week's volatile market as well as some strategies you could be using to secure some money during\nThese volatile I'm drawn to rescue this is the word on well we'll be right back after this [noise]\nLet's face it we love the locks and we love the letter find your favorite radio station this one of course what she couldn't find those easier if we taught

again as always we talk about this uh each and every week of course for those out there who are either retired or approaching retirement\nYou know weeks like last week and this week seemed to ah create a little bit of anxiety for people who are close as I said to retirement or maybe\nYou're already in retirement and that probably is something that's good if if that gets you to really think about things and and how your money's allocated where\nIt's invest it and what these types of\nUh swings of and volatility means to you especially if you're living off of your retirement money or your

you I'm John Dankosky reminding you\nDon't run out of money before you run out of time now back to the show [noise]\n[noise] Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nMm\nYeah All right we're back down to rescue the word I'm well jokes as always if you have an email the Harvard was sent me this email questions today or John ads and the word on well that ... that\nThere John Edward oh well that's why that musicals law there wasn't for a group yes exclusion who I'm Talking with Mark Emmert said one of our advisors here at the farm again Grand Canyon planning and you have questions or concerns you'd like to talk with one of our visor shared are from forty nine nine one ten fifty five is the phone number for you know nine nine one\nTen fifty five mark I want to get to a couple of emails I always encourage folks to send us email questions did you ever done that the word I'm well that counts as dear John at the word I'm about that kind of want to get to one of those emails right now and then I Wanna get into a topic you mark that basically relate to this email that says dear John this from Peter by the way to Peter thanks for this email here John\nI'm close to retirement and considering options for withdrawing from my investments once retired my question is should I draw from my taxable accounts or should I withdraw from my non taxable accounts once I retire\nAnd I would I Would have added to that to Peter by the way or should I Do both right ah but great question because that's something\nThat we always want to understand right and that's what's important about taking into account taxes mark into a financial plan even while you're building value of that financial plan and and growing that plan over the years we should be thinking about taxes long before\nThe distribution face which is where Peter is at this point thinking about retiring shortly a one way have you ah talk a little bit to that market and all that my two cents yeah\nThat was one of those things that uh we always try to look at it like you mentioned\nWhat is the big picture look like and really trying to identify where we're going to get the biggest bang for our buck\nUm play on words bang for your but yeah and and and sometimes ah when you go to retire maybe you're retiring and sixty years of age but you don't plan to trigger a benefits such as Social Security 'til much later and and you're a later years maybe up to sixty five maybe up to Seventy before you turn on\nAnd maybe your incomes going to be nonexistent until then and so maybe it would be more advantageous for Peter to\nTo withdraw funds from his retirement accounts to supplement or replace the income from his regular\nW to employment income if that's the type of um income he receives\nAnd use that now because maybe it's taxable income will be nonexistent exactly and so maybe he won't have such a tax burden now we're in the future we don't know where tax rates are going to be and of course when you start adding additional sources of income such a Social Security or maybe any pension income that you may be entitled to you know that could certainly change\nOr move the needle from a tax basis so we just want to sit down and look at all the moving parts and decide collectively which and maybe it will be a combination of the boats are but you know looking at those those types of accounts and looking at and talking with the CPAs that are the folks work with\nTo make sure we're we're asking all those questions in deciding which is going to be the best avenue to go down\nYou know mark there's something called you know I mean there's all sorts of names you could put to it but bracket creep as it might be in other words uh currently the tax code has a number of different brackets tax brackets\nAnd depending on your income you fall within range in a bracket right so it's very possible that depending on where you're taking money from the um the tax\nA status of that money may create you to creep into the next tax brackets\nTherefore paying a much higher rate of taxes so we want to understand that and if you have the availability to pull money from a non taxable account or to an account that would be taxed at a lower rate maybe a capital gains rate rather than an ordinary income tax rate that might make the difference\nOf saving thousands of dollars a year in taxes\nAnd as you know I Do a lot of planning with veterans litter yeah you know in their seventies and eighties and a lot of times I deal with those that are still married\nAnd a lot of times when one is in in a care situation and the other one is just living independent healthy\nUm a lot of times we can do some planning around that where we can use right the expense of let's say the the the the spouse in this case was in an assisted living type of arrangement ... I'm In large part a lot of that expense can be a tax deduction\nAgainst income and so in many cases is more advantageous to pull money is from a retirement account or has a lot of time a lot of that money could be coming out\nAnd what the CPAs blessing of course of that money could be coming out relatively tax free right so we look at all those options and see if we can't\nFind ways to maximize those distributions here's a here's this story that just occurred to with another client of mine had done are were you every year folks you know we usually do a at a minimum a annual review with the client depending on what their financial situation is but we we pulled the client and then we're talking this week and of course in this particular\nCase the individual turned Seventy this year and will be Seventy and a half as of December ... now that means of course that this individual needs to take a what's called the required minimum distribution from their retirement accounts\nSo what we did is we did a quick analysis of the value of their portfolio and what that minimum required amount would be\nA and we understood what we had to take and we also understood that for for this year mark there's that little caviar for the first year that you would have a required distribution which is that you can take that require distribution in the year following\nThe actual uh require distribution is require right so in this case if that individual had to take the distribution in two thousand sixteen because it's the first one meaning just turned seven and a half they can push that out to next year\nHowever um we want to understand again with the tax ramifications are going to be of this because I was talking to the individual still working age Seventy fantastic [noise] still\nContributing to four one K. a healthy being able to do all that and and and I asked the questions are you planning on retiring what what's going on with your financial life what are you thinking here\nAnd he was saying maybe I might retire next year I said okay well if you're gonna retire next year that means you're going to give up that hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income that you're earning isn't that true and he said well yes I said well what if we waited to take that require distribution until next year\nBecause if you're not going to have that hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income well maybe we'll take that are empty that distribution and we're going to lower your tax a tax rate on that\nUh so that really made a big impact because his distribution was going to be about Fifteen thousand dollars\nSo the difference of maybe a Fifteen Percent tax bracket versus a twenty five percent tax bracket markets thousands of dollars and all that if he took it and this year he probably just put it in the bank because he wouldn't need it they need it he was he had exactly right he didn't need the money\nBut of course we were required to take it even though we don't need it and I remember that folks that's critical and and here's a situation where he has a four O. one K. he still working still contributing to it\nAnd mark as you and I know if if you're still working in a participant in Fort Wayne K plan even if you're Seventy and a half or Seventy two or Seventy five or eighty five\nYou're still participating in that plant you do not need to take required minimum distributions from the plant and again that was something he was not aware of uh so we were able to discuss that as well knowing that that was not going to need to be part of the calculation for the requirement of distribution\nAnd one of the things I like to to our conversation about clients as it I mean you probably have a similar thing a lot of our clients are taking that money out of their retirement accounts like IRAs and ... and such only because they have to ... and they go well gosh I'm doing it because I'm they'll all be penalized otherwise\nI like to have those conversations where we can you know if we're gonna have to do it anyway reallocate him yeah maybe we take those monies and leverage that into something else where it's going to be more impactful tax wise in the future or\nMaybe part of a legacy plan ... to maybe do some sort of planning with maybe use of life insurance if you're healthy enough to make sure we can leave tax free benefit dollars to the next generation of fire tea or whomever yeah um and that's a real a interesting conversation for a lot of folks out there so we love I Love having that conversation\nNow you're talking to mark because right we're taking time after tax dollars now\nAnd we're able to place those are in or I should say before tax dollars when you contributed does now became taxable when you took the distribution but now re allocating those assets into a plan that ultimately would be tax free\nFor your beneficiaries whether that your spouse or whether that's your children your grandchildren are as you mentioned maybe a a charity of your choice\nOr so boy all sorts of options for folks but again until you sit down with an educated and\nExperienced financial advisor folks a lot of those things may not ever come to light for you so I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunity to sit down and talk with us from Grand Canyon planning\nHappy to do that sometimes we're a little busy and may have to wait a week or two to get in front of climate but that's okay yeah yeah I don't buy on her please get on the counter would love to sit down and talk with you to see what you're\nDoing a plan for your financial future hey mark ... is always you being here mark\nAnd then of course he outside is big which can hold a few more thousand\n[noise] and it makes me wonder do the Democrats ever
