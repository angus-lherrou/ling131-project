payer [noise]\nAnd the bullet train to know where we'll talk about that and just a few minutes [noise]\nBut for someone to get back to Hillary Clinton\nRemember this cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\n\n\nWhere do we start with that what about traditional marriage\nAnd his Supreme Court case that alter the marriage laws for every single state when Obama ran he was asked about same sex marriage he posted Hillary posted Obama said and I'm quoting him God is in the mix close quote\nA few years later you posed traditional marriage\nWould you want to talk about your party that is undermining traditional values roe v Wade\nHideous decision Nineteen Seventy three struck down every single anti abortion law in every state and federal as an issue that should be at the state and local level as anti non school earlier so eloquently put it these are the kinds of matters that should be dealt with at the legislative process not\nBefore the courts healthcare\nObamacare one giant leap towards single payer\nAnd of course Obamacare was supposed to solve all our problems with Joe Biden say when Obamacare was assigned quote is a big ... fast forward it's not nearly far enough Obama's already know signed onto single payer knowing full well Obamacare was nothing more than a\nStop towards their eventually goal which is single payer and you want to talk about a party there threatening traditional values and everything we stand for and don't get me started on sports and now they've taken politics to taking a knee\n\nYou're the problem my goodness this phony narrative of\nInstitutional systemic structural anti black police bias not only is it wrong not only do the facts not support the narrative\nBut it's making things worse Rami manual since fear of being accused of racism cause police officers in Chicago to quote roles themselves into a fetal position quote unquote it'd be passive not proactive as a result\nCrimes gone up\nSo I haven't seen the numbers recently but a few months ago year to year police deaths were up fifty percent you think maybe just maybe the anti cup rhetoric has inspired some of these bad people\nOfficers Lou Enron was in New York We're sitting in their squad cars and they were executed by some person who was inspired by this black lives matter movement we can we know that is because he posted on his\nFacebook post\nThe cops in Dallas who were shot it OK an execution style\nShot by a guy who also was motivated by the black lives matter movement because he said so she posted it\n\nYou can't even have dinner now you have people like John limited who's not a lawyer and his colleague it's being at the CNN\nChris Cuomo who is a lawyer both saying that you have a First Amendment right to enter a restaurant a privately owned restaurants and heckle and a fish person provided that person is a public official are you kidding me\n\nAnd you want to talk about a threat to values and tradition\nWhat'd Mexican more to say if you find a cabinet member surround them let them know they're not welcome anywhere anymore and you want to talk about\nAn attack on everything you stand for what incredible chutzpah\nNow Donald Trump is frequently called a liar right let me play this clip from Hillary one more time listen very carefully what you said about the white vote\nRight within an hour and then went for me and [noise] ... white women have than a voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nWell because uh people vote typically the way their spouse votes than if you're married you vote the way your spouse or vote but according to Hillary that means the man is telling them what to do right\nOr the white vote has only been one twice in the lab I'm sixty years uh my husband being one of the two uh Lyndon Johnson being the other\nLet's hear that one more time since Donald Trump of course is a liar and\nHas only been one twice in the last um sixteen years uh my husband being one of the two ah Lyndon Johnson being the other [noise]\nOkay now according to the rubber Center for public opinion which is based in ... a Cornell\nWhen Bill Clinton ran in Nineteen Ninety two\nHe got thirty nine percent of the white vote George Herbert Walker Bush got forty one percent and Ross Perot got Twenty one percent when Bill Clinton ran for reelection in Nineteen Ninety six he got forty four percent of the white vote according to the rubber center Bob Dole got forty six percent\nIn Ross Perot got nine percent so let's let's hear that again and of course the person or two she told us the interview worked either ... or didn't want to correct her\n... has only been one twice\nGo back a little further\nCandidates for decades now or the white vote has only been one twice in the last six years or my husband being one of the two uh Lyndon Johnson being the other [noise]\nWhere do you mean to say\nThe bigger problem of course is the person who she was interviewing with who didn't say jak excuse me ah no your husband didn't not even close thirty thirty nine percent in Nineteen Ninety two forty four percent in Ninety six\n\nNo George Herbert Walker Bush when a greater percentage of the white vote then your husband did in Nineteen Ninety two and Bob Dole won a greater percentage of the wife opened your husband did in Nineteen Ninety six you were wrong and of course you weren't corrected Heidi Heitkamp says she decided to vote against Kavanaugh because of his body language\nAnd you obviously yes vote on on Kavanaugh then switched to your vote to know after your where he watched his testimony understand with the sound off I found that really interesting I'm Wondering can you explain what you saw with the sound off that you change your mind well I\nThink the first off it's important to know that I watched it now in its entirety I watched her testimony I watch their testimony I listened and and I'll be tortured with the sound down\nCouldn't kill that point of this hearing um I was preparing a statement saying I was going to be a yes I watch the hearing and during the process of listening I thought this is a this is um you know we expect someone to have the Koran we expect someone to have a judicial temperament\nAnd what I thought I thought well maybe tainted by what\nI heard and so I turned off the phone and watched it with that found objects is opening comment\n'cause I heard I heard her say I heard her say that and then she made a second point in the second point was false second point was that a two time the last ... years the white vote has gone to the Democrats when in fact it only gone one time and that would limit Johnson in Nineteen sixty four she also said my husband was the second one I play it again\nRight when the when I went for me and [noise] white women had than a voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now or the white vote has only been one twice in\nThe white vote only been one twice\nNow last year last sixty years on my husband being one of the two\nAnd no he was not one of the two Sean so that's all I'm Talking about you were just wrong about that\nAfter all except that except for one thing she did say before or a Republican or a decade I mean again I Would have to earn some white as\nWell Shawn you're being awfully generous I Would like that people give the same kind of flexibility to things that Trump says Trump is a very imprecise speaker she says something he gets pounded and I want people to go well what he meant was is what he meant was that I think it's fair\nHe gets counted for what he said about Charlottesville ... they're good people on both sides he wasn't saying they're good Nazis on both sides good fascist on both side good white supremacist on both sides he was talking about the argument about whether or not the Confederate statues memorials ought to be in the public square\nThere are good people on both sides that argue my mother and father didn't think we should be removed that what you're talking about\nSo we're going to hold 'em a Donald Trump to be very precise and if you said something imprecise and you can interpret it the worst possible way the why can't I Do that with Hillary\nWell here we met was a white woman that's not what she said she was very very specific she said the Democrats have not won the white vote in last sixty or do I need to do that again\nLike when I when I went for me and [noise] white women have been a voting against democratic presidential candidate for a decade south or the white vote has only been one twice in\nThe last ... I'm sixty years my husband being one of the two\nOkay so she just dead wrong\nNow I Want to talk real quickly about Derek Lewis Derek Lewis is that a UFC fighter that won his fight in a thunderous knocked down\nBy Donald Trump called ...\nAnd he sent a few hours before the fight Donald Trump call him and told and now the guy he was fighting is a Russian [noise]\n[noise] see how much the bank and if you're down the stretch [noise]\n\nSorry Donald Trump called and told me that nothing's wrong for making their own homes who [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom calling me and told me no knock this Russian blank blank out I thought Trump Russians we come back Fresno County da and California not happy about the laws that allow bad guys on the streets we need more prisons\nLarry Elder through all the others [noise]\n[noise] well\n[noise] let us read news up\nAfter ... surfing and Michael has slammed into the Florida Panhandle leaving widespread destruction that at least one death before continuing its charge across the U.S southeast authorities reporters at least one death Wednesday of a man killed by falling tree and said search and rescue teams are seeking to hit her stricken humidity's ask conditions allowed\nPresident Trump is boosting Pennsylvania's Republican candidate says he works to rally support ahead of November's midterm elections ... representatives my Kelly and Lou Barletta up on the stage with him Wednesday in Erie and urge to tend to use to vote for them\nThe New York state police superintendent says a limousine service operator is solely responsible for a troubled ... being on the road during a crash that killed twenty people last weekend\nOn Wall street that al ... thirty one points Wednesday and they asked me five hundred dollars for the fifth day in a row\nMore details are news dot com\n\nHey I'll hear\nWhat my [noise]\nYou live bike yeah bite right in the graphic kids left me a while ago you know how long it is being last day after day not being able to prove that reservation pardon me remember when you got me for the kid you told them you know your kids go how fun enjoy the outdoors and be careful [noise] Mm\nYeah I mean it when they protect playing hard at my spouse and I made a really profound the factory um well did you get my tires on little ran off my feet and remind kids how to land very [noise]\nOh you are ...
