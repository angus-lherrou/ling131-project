Indiana you're North Dakota you're Montana you're Missouri well every single one of those Democrats senators said just may not be long for this world electorally speaking\nAnd there may be Republicans were going to take over those seats and maybe even more maybe John James in\nMichigan is he going to be Debbie Stabenow if you guys have your act together he will so building that don't make that happen is going to lose in New Jersey he will if we have our act together so good that don't make that happen make history in the Garden State go do that\nNo matter what exit you live off of in Jersey go do that return Bob Menendez to private life it can happen that\nWill we get seven or eight brand new a Republican senators or or more like four or something in between I dunno but it'll be something that will be a more Republican Senate vanity\nNow and over in the house over in the house let's let's let's go and take a look at the uh at the numbers on this in these midterms\nWhat you've got is obviously a house of representatives that contains four hundred and thirty five people might the margin right now is Republicans to thirty six Democrats one Ninety three and they're sick vacancies right to thirty six one Ninety three so when you've got to have to Eighteen\nAnd it just so happens right now that are about two hundred are solid Democrat or a lean Democrat\nMaybe a little more than two hundred about two hundred are solidly Republican or lean Republican maybe a little less than two hundred maybe two oh five one Ninety five so in the middle there are about thirty some that are toss ups\nThirty some that are toss ups and it's let's say it really is two hundred two hundred that leaves thirty five and all we need is Eighteen of those thirty five now\nI Know yeah

country\nEven more than the politicians the groups I think the progressive agenda\nAbsolutely out of control absolutely disgusting\n\nLike after the shooting in Parkland this slaughter the synagogue they just push their agenda within hours within hours the media are politicizing this mass murder\nOf American Jews by the\nSubhuman cockroach in Pittsburgh shame on a shame on them just when you think the media reached the low point they go lower\n\nWe're brave men and blue police officers who ran out\nOf that certainly got four of them were shot it wasn't that long ago when the media and the left and the prior administration trash and law enforcement left and right\n\nAnd they barely even praise them now but they'll be back to their old routine and a few weeks trashing law enforcement because that's what they do do a ban and there have for the cops for Seventy two hours maybe Ninety six hours but there'll be back don't return\n\nTheir hawking this letter that was sent the New York times magazine ... talking it out there talking it by a group called bend the art\nJewish leaders sorry Jewish leaders these are progressive Caesar activists left wing political action groups\nAs our buddy bench repair points out you know who runs than they are Alexander Soros George Soros son why don't they look into this the media because they don't\nCare meanwhile the rabbi\nAt the synagogue in Pittsburgh he's walking in the president despite the\nThat if CNN host as you'll hear later we're trying to draw the rabbi into a debate into a controversy because that is all the media cares about\n\nNow\nWe're like prior administration that effectively one door with the Jewish state of Israel Obama\nSecretary of State Clinton secretary of State Kerry\n\nKerry and his last big speech openly trashed the Jewish state Obama treated the prime minister of Israel\n\nWas absolute disrespect by contempt David reached into the Israeli electricity trying to feed them\n\nAnd they refused do no way out\n\nWas just a few weeks left the ministry and they refused to defend Israel and the un against her enemies they voted present and yet another hate filled resolution at the United nations\n\nThe American media in this country I said back in may had blood on its hands went on moss backed by the Muslim Brotherhood backed by Iran backed by Hezbollah\nWas riding on the Gaza Strip shooting missiles into Israel Israel defending itself they immediately attacked Israel they immediately attacked a Jewish state\n\nVirtually all of them I spoke about that all month\n\nOne block Obama pushed through the surrender you violated our constitution push through the Iran deal gave him a Hummer again on one point five billion dollars in ransom\nFollowed by facilitating another hundred and fifty billion dollars to that regime which is a terrorist regime which has its own people and it's so journalist by the way media\nWhich has said it intends to destroy all the Jews in Israel and by the way he intends to destroy the United states Obama was celebrated\n\nHe was celebrated\n\nObama literally armed with billions and billions of dollars a grave enemy of ours and the Jewish people\n\nAnd then when ... when the president Donald Trump withdrew from the deal he was attacked\nSome Republicans like Bob Corker it was attacked by the media\n\nYou ask any Jew in Israel the\nPresident may have a fifty percent favorability rating in the United states is a Ninety percent favorability rating in Israel Ninety percent\nNinety percent\nThis president is the best friend the Jewish people in Israel have ever\nBar no other president\nWhich is one of the reasons this mass murder piece of crap went into that said I got one of the reasons he denounced Trump being too many Jews around I mean that\nYou know like a son in law like his daughter like it's three grandchildren I don't know that we've ever had a president certainly not modern history that a Jewish children and grandchildren\n\nAnd despite every presidential election\nPandering\nAbout recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel pandering about moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem this president Europe opposed to the un opposed him even some Jews in our own country opposed to like J Street\nHe's appointed\nA great patriots and the most pro Israel American as a passenger to Israel from the United states David Freeman he's appointed to the United nations Nikki Haley\nWho day in and day\n\nHas been fighting these anti Semitic countries when like wow like his running mate vice president Pence Ala lifelong evangelical Christian and supporter of the state of Israel when it was in Congress when he was governor now is vice president\n\nAnd the media wants you to believe that somehow a lot of beautiful pressure as human beings American Jews in the synagogue because Trump and then when you call on my way not really saying that they may get a massage or their mouse\n\nBoth sides of their mouth\n\nMeanwhile\nWhen's the last time Jake Tapper\n\nToday a story not a short segment not three met a story on Louis Farrakhan and the Democrats won so last time Don Lemon Chris
