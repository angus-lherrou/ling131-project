{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "It was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not a good idea that it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five\nThousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one and a non combat reason that people died in the navy was due to the melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck some shifts\nIn the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful you know you're young\nRaise and and they're developing skin cancer but then I read on and I said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went home it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength ... three formula help with that\nCritical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body starting to slow down for us it's kind of a horrible thing that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then at the lack of flexibility you start to stiffen up and you feel\nAt night especially here in bad role in from side to side you wake up with your knees are hurting your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat said this in a setting in the ... with a lack of vitamin D three my formula so here's someone listening\nRight now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball and pain muscle pain fibromyalgia I Would say on my formula like immediately and start thinking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that the theme good you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin whack a mind thing it's not what you can talk to your body absorb when\nI Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy your sleep your outlook your mood\nAnd then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like a little bit younger crashed\nAnd who wouldn't want that way and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results to be seen\nWell one of the surprising one would I gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and his blood profile is perfectly\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid result\nIn by getting Dr ... three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offered this only available to you listeners today so when you do call pleased to be sure to mention this program and you're going to get a risk free trial\nOf Dr paying gives his vitamin D three again this was only available to your listeners\nAnd only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nPlus if you call right now you also qualified to receive an extra free supply with your order today to

back\nAnd when you do call and order you're not going to be enrolled in one of those automatic monthly subscription programs this was a one time order so I encourage you the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three so\nHow about if folks to me what it really comes down to here as we're not getting the right form or enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr\nBecause I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D to vitamin D three and the two is the title of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body so has to be converted into vitamins the\n... three is the activators form so it's ready to go to work now in the street that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof or shouldn't be wow\nSo Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ... people in their\nForties so I you know you start taking more of those aches and pains like never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start telling her you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on a formula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done areas\nOf clarity you know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr ... such that your fast melt the three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath all in the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of this vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like this and\nThe sooner you can get on my formula better I mean you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high mobility life from here on out\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and documenting just working someone expect when they start taking your fast melt the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first survivor oh is that something is changing in your body because the chicks dark so many different cycles when your body that you'll start having less Shane having more energy and\nHaving a better mental clarity better sleep your mood can be affected by this vitamin D three is necessary to get these things running\nWell Dr ... unfortunately we only have a few minutes left anything else you want to share with her audience here in our final minutes\nFor those of you listening covered a lot of our own work in the body is tricky as you know and we're talking to your listeners have your show\nYou know there are all walks of life but all various conditions and so I'm trying to get some good health advice here for some pointed and get yourself out of it get yourself on a formula and see for yourself against the law for\nYou to try something to see if it works\nBut it's an interesting way of\nTalking about nutrition we're not talking about rocket science fair right a lot of science behind what I'm Talking about the key is to get on a formula and give it a month or two\nEvery day take one of the Senate and start the improvements in your pain your blood pressure your blood sugar energy or sleep habits this is my appeal to your listeners\nOf the final quarter of this year two thousand and Eighteen and first trading day in October\nAnd boy we got off to a great start didn't wait the Dow has been really a rocking it and we're seeing a lot of these blue chip companies doing very well right now we did see also interest rates spiking\nAre hitting some\nHigh is that we haven't seen since two thousand and eleven on that ten year and some highs\nThat we haven't seen since two thousand and fourteen on the thirty year and what does that mean well that means for those adjustable rate mortgages out there the interest rates are going up for those longer term thirty year Fifteen and thirty year mortgages rates are going to be going up so again you if you're in the process of\nA refinancing or possibly purchasing a new home and you were contemplating should I be locking in my interest rate\nYou probably have to have a serious discussion with your loan professional to understand what's happening and to see what your options are because yes interest rates have gone up things are changing that's affecting\nSome of these uh\nFinancial stocks out their bank stocks and financial stocks are doing well because of this they they will profit as interest rates go up\nAlso money will flow into the banks right as we start to see\nPossibly I should say the interest rates higher with CDs that haven't been for quite some time they've been depressed often times many people now can be looking at putting money into CDs if they're looking for a safe place for that money\nOr or for some type of short term dollars you might be getting some rate of return on your money right now\nAs we start to see interest rates rise we had strong economic data we saw a new a private sector jobs a blowout on private sector jobs\nTwo hundred and thirty thousand this\nPast month versus a hundred and eighty five thousand expected great news great news or all of these things are reasons why we're seeing again interest rates going up\nWe saw a Amazon this past week announcing they're going to be increasing their minimum wage for their employees up to Fifteen dollars\nA for us employees whether they're part time or full time employees is is a minimum wage for the company Amazon of course this is a each company has their own rules that they can set when it comes to minimum wage as long as they comply with\nLocal or state and federal laws are but in this case Amazon is taking the step to increase it above and beyond\nWhat are those averages are and I you know if we think about it I it was Bernie Sanders who is calling Amazon out\nA stating that they were paying well below what they should be for their employees so I don't know what what the reason was why they decided to do that the stock took a little bit of a hit because of it why well obviously payroll and most companies is one of the largest internal expenses\nWhich means that does take away from profits but\nYou know in this economy today we've got a very very low unemployment and very high employment right now and we're basically looking for a good employees in our companies and so in order to keep these people\nAre you may have to pay a little bit more and maybe that's what Amazon is thinking and maybe there are a little ahead of the curve on this but it's going to be interesting to see what\nOther companies will do as we move forward or will other corporations follow suit alright folks I Do want to take care of a couple of housekeeping things as I Do each and every week here on the word on wealth as always a check out our website\nGrand Canyon planning each week we do send out a weekly economic update\nAnd that's at Grand canyon planning dot com you slow down to the bottom of our website and there's a spot you can enter your email

actually get transferred from maybe uh the person I'm inheriting it from into my own name well I oftentimes in order to do that a deed needs to be prepared\nAnd um if there's an outstanding mortgage on that that's going to certainly put a different level of complexity into that as well so these are things that you need to be talking to\nA depending on the individual who's handling the state that you're inheriting this from either the trustee or the executor of the state to make sure that they're doing everything correctly in order to transition that property over to you if you're inheriting a piece of real estate now I oftentimes would suggest that you talk\nTo your CPA if you've got a CPA and or maybe a real estate professional to make\nSure that you're getting the good real estate advice

look forward to catching on the other side of this break stay right here with us folks this is the word on wealth and I'm John Donne bras game\n\n\nBut Seth leaps and show where the most important voices speak\nFor a good friend William J Bennett graduation over for the coming on again friends and scholar Heather Mac Donald thinking it's always romantic thing here at the right John hinder off her from the power lines laws to do with it is that\nTo me to find a man in public service bill Montgomery thanks very much a factual conversation professor Alan Dershowitz anytime you want to do is tough weekdays from free to fix on nine sixty the patriots\nAre the boys aren't married yet and don't have kids they're girl is married and she has two kids All right so we say that if the girl is deceased her share we'll go to her children right and then typically with the boys we would say well one of them is deceased the share we'll go\nEqually took his his his surviving siblings right and the other ... beneficiaries right but in this case we might say well if he has children not to have his share go to his children to 'cause we're thinking way in the future right right we're not planning ahead mhm even though maybe he's never going to have children\nBut it wouldn't matter because if he doesn't have children or go to another two siblings right so we might that might be what we want to do and we would do the same thing for the other brother now\nSome sometimes the question as well um well the spouses are part of the families want to leave something for the spouses well then we would need to purposely do that we would want to list them right and that's something you could do or you could say look I'm not leaving anything any grandchildren I don't care it just goes to my three children and if one of them is deceased the survivors of the three and so on and then if\nIf my three children are deceased then I Want it to go equally to whoever my grandchildren are at that point right but you do something like ... or you could say look\nUpon my passing I Want everything to go to the society of St Paul ... and if by chance of society of St Vincent DePaul has not been in existence then I Want my share to go to the wounded warrior foundation right right so you could do something like that and you can mix it you could say look\nUpon my passing 'em my state goes to my three children equally and then if one of my children is deceased fifty percent of their share we'll go to this charity and fifty percent goes to their children you know what I mean right I I probably wouldn't advocate that but you could\nSo there's really no limit here but we want to carry it out we want to at least to go to the beneficiaries children and then to wrap it around to the beneficiaries\nNow sometimes we might have other family members of the question is if you don't have kids who do I leave your ... leave your state too sometimes could be your siblings right could be your nieces and nephews or could be a really good friends could be a charity could be the church you go to\nI mean there's the idea is to think about this while I don't care who gets my stuff I'll be that I don't care where it goes okay but maybe there's a relatively good use it or maybe there's a charity that's really impacted your life or maybe your church means a lot to you or you know\nI think to Jonathan oftentimes to uh we find that it may change over time in other words if you're married and you have a spouse and you create some type of an estate planning some type of uh beneficiary designation if maybe you don't have children you're thinking about maybe charities or maybe\nFriends or family or people that have touched you in a certain way throughout your lifetime that are important to you that have made an impact on you [noise]\nUm but then maybe something happens to your spouse where they have an issue whether it's Alzheimer's or whether it's cancer or whatever the illness maybe and all of a sudden you see a new experience that type of situation and now all of a sudden\nYou feel compelled to maybe make a change or to maybe have a charity that you've ultimately seeing\nThat would be in that and that's that frightening fall and that's important and and those types of gifts I mean\nIt it was really this past couple of weeks Jonathan we've had a number of clients that have been affected deeply by Alzheimer's where a spouse\nHas had all timers in a couple of ... instances other spouse finally had um passed on but uh others are still dealing with this and it's getting to a point to where it gets worse and so as an example Jonathan if we think about this if you've got us\nA spouse right now that you're I'm dealing with who has a an issue such as Alzheimer's\nIt is critical Jonathan that you have documents in place I Would imagine so that you could ... business whether it's health decisions in financial decisions in making sure that there's a there's a plan in place in the event of a well this is the worse eye so\nThis is the worry this is why you do stay planning documents that this is the worst case scenario right because of vets discuss what happens if you don't have a state planning documents in this situation if you don't have estate planning documents in this situation you may or may not be able to do anything on your spouse's behalf and you may be forced to go to court and become a conservative\nYeah not not a good position to be in John thing we need to talk about this and another segment coming to the end of the segment

for eight or nine nine one ten fifty five for eight or nine nine one ten fifty five I look forward to meeting with you I'm John Dankosky\nReminding you don't run out of money before you run out of time now back to the show\n[noise]\nAll right John to rescue the word on wealth as always going to be with you here for the full hour today we're talking some\nFinancial talk stay planning soft tax dollars [noise] and I were going to be bringing a on a Darren ... hotter and hotter we're going to be talking\nAbout a couple of uh issues facing a people out there with businesses but also a this is an issue that I find happens often is um\nMaybe you own a piece of real estate and you want to get that piece of property to a family member and you're wondering what's the best way for me to do this in the most tax efficient way to where I can take advantage of either attacks gainer attacks loss or whatever it might be\nA and then also have it be beneficial to the next in line that I'm transferring it to\nAnd this is a real challenge because IRS his onto it iris is wise to these things someone to bring on a Darren Darren how you doing I'm doing great of course that they aren't cigarettes cigarettes cheap Potter and high sort of course down to a CPA we have them on the show is a regular and we appreciate and being here as always\nAnd we're going to talk a little bit about this idea Darren of I own a piece of property\nOr whether I've had it for a short period of time a long period of time that doesn't matter but what really does matter is is what the true value of that property because if I'm going to transfer that property to a loved one whether it's one of my children or a parent or brother or sister or whoever\nBut I'm going to give it to them or sell it to them at what maybe we would consider to be at discount right is that the right word right now you lesson appraised value right\nAnd and so what is the let's talk about the idea that OK I own the property I don't need it anymore and I need my parents need a place to live so I'm just gonna it's two hundred thousand but I'm In the south to my parents for one fifty how's that sound\nNow I paid two hundred and four it can take a fifty thousand dollar loss and on my taxes because of that\nIt'd be nice but uh they're not on my you know you're not going to be able to do that and\nReally if you think about it you know real estate transactions that very well documented bright right\nBut there are a couple of you know I don't know who seek to see parts of uh of any real estate transactions number one cause base will sometimes becomes an issue mhm and the IRS understands these things I'm ... and so\nIf you bought it for you know let's say you did buy for one fifty and you put fifty thousand dollars of improvements on that right\nWell you you can fudge the numbers are up for it to the number down on them so at a at a lesser amount on the ... than the appraised value because of those are related party you can play games with a higher risk throw those games will just say you can't so a property for last related party\nGot it except if you can prove that you're selling it for market value then you've got you can take the loss alright and so we've we've had different situations over the last even ten years sure it ... you may have had\nA significant loss and you are selling the property to a family member but you bought it for six hundred thousand dollars and you're selling it to him for five hundred thousand dollars\nBecause after your market value if you've ... you've got to be able to prove that right even if it is a mom or dad and they're buying it for market value that that doesn't preclude you for taking walks but you know the burden of proof is going to be on the individual to prove that you're not so you know there's a discount\nRight and one of the things I and I am a real estate broker but I don't um I don't you know I represent clients in real estate transactions they aren't\nUm but I Would say this is that whenever a real estate transactions ... most people a sign their name a bunch of times and the transaction ready to go to the quote to closing and they have all the papers and there's a you know half a century inch stack of papers\nThat you go through and you sign your name and you sign your name and loan documents and the cell documents and the recording documents in this document and the escrow fees that are that goes on and on all the documents that you're signing\nOne of those documents that you usually sign is called an affidavit of property value are up in the affidavit of real value I think it is and you basically stating this is what the property is the value of it\nThat I'm buying it for so there's a way the county has records right they arrive value if they want to know what the new property so what the property so for the new value they want to know um you know anytime why do we have to have permits when we\nUm you know try to do any changes to our homes well two reasons one of safety reasons right they want to come out in spec make sure you're doing everything correctly you're not going to no one's going to get hurt or killed on the property because you did something stupid\nOr but too is is if you put a new bathroom in or if you put an addition on your house guest what your property taxes are going up folks right because the value of the property went up there is going to be a up you're going to pay for that\nAnd so there's this affidavit of real property that you execute as well and that's basically you're you're now that's going to be recorded there's a lot of things that go into a sale but if you do a quick to slide under the under the you know kinda door sale to mom or dad or to sister brother son or daughter\nSometimes a lot of these pieces don't properly get done right and you don't necessarily have a clear title either in many cases people do what's called the quick claim deed\nA and often times are quick claim they just basically it there could be loans on the property that could be um clouds on the title but I'm quick claiming it to you I don't have the problem anymore now you take you inherit the problem right so you might get a property for less than what you perceive the true market value is but there could be some other headaches that come with that so\nUsually it makes sense for you to use the title company even in a situation when it's a closely related party they are selling it to the ... a lot cleaner yeah it's kinda like buying a used\nCar right and you might use curry Europe there you're buying and they also like\nYou know saying rather than you got to be careful on those yeah so again so when we come to this point of okay I sold it for less than they aren't too a related party now all of a sudden I Can't take that did that and I can't take a lower price you still have to report\nIt on your tax return so you're going to show with the title company though though was shoe a a ten Ninety nine a sort of government knows what you sold it for ... if you don't report anything you've got a problem because on the higher ups doesn't understand what the basis wants to begin with right\nBut the problem is you can't record again so again in that situation your tax return actually shows\nTwo hundred thousand dollars of cost sold it for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a chosen fifty thousand dollar loss\nBut you gotta make sure that you identify as a reward later party seal so to that last has not you know through your return\nRight and now and the other side of the coin there and you've got the person who bought it\nAnd now the person who bought it for fifty thousand dollars say less than what the market value as\nA ... immediately they've got a fifty thousand dollar appreciable gain there\nAnd if they're going to be using it for personal residents I guess there's a benefit versus if they're going to be using it for an investment property there could be some potential additional tax obligations that the buyer may have in the future as well because it costs basis sell though is that correct that's correct so again folks\nBefore you do something like this just like anything when you have a financial transaction make sure you talk to a professional\nYou should probably be talking to your CPA about this you should be talking to your\nReal estate professional or maybe a title company as I mentioned how do you transfer this property and there are some legal issues when it comes to this is well you don't want to touch base with a a a real estate attorney as well just to make sure that\nYour idea maybe sounded maybe find that may be perfectly fine but just understand all of the ramifications of what you're trying to accomplish and make sure that you're not going to have any surprises you know a year from now two years from now three years from now if the IRS comes knocking on your\nDoor because they're looking at a tax return from three years ago\nA and they're saying well wait a minute you owe us you know Seventeen thousand dollars or whatever the number\nIs ... and you can also have some ... some challenges there might be some better ways of doing it from an estate planning same point yes rather than selling it or gifting you'd over the parents so exactly right there were a lot of issues to look at but just be careful that just be careful but you're right there are some ways to do it to a state planning as well\nAh Darren I'm just real quickly got a a short period of time left in the segment\nAny other thoughts on maybe a business owner is out there because this is a big one business owners have some uh a little extra flexibility when it comes to the actions versus just the

space we\nCan send the Democrats there and save this country for us say this world for us what do you think any ways we have several stories to go through but I Want\nTo start with we have an election in thirty one days folks it is the most important election of our lifetimes it is a\nMid term and normally what happens in the mid term is they the voters vote more of the opposite party into power than was there with the Republican or with the ah\n\nWith the president [noise] that was elected\nThat's in twenty ten is\nObama was voted into office in two thousand and eight we're both a ... a Democrat Senate and the Democrat house and he lost both or he lost the house\nIn two thousand and ten two years later folks we cannot let that happen because let's say when\nAnd both the house and the Senate they will take America into Venezuela territory\nNow we must vote and keep the Congress Republican if we do not keep Congress Republican the FBI de OJ will overthrow our president\nAnd destroy our nation as we know what Obama has politicized the FBI de OJ IRS B. L. M. national park system and every other federal agency we have Trump is doing what he can to restore sense to our government\nBut the Democrats are putting all pulling out all the stops to destroy Trump folks we can't let that happen we must remember that our forefathers have done for us and now we must do the same for our children our grandchildren and their children\nAnd if we do not no one else will vote in November for Republicans if Democrats win they will impeach gambling on even if he is concerned and he is confirmed now\nBut it has never been done before but if they win in November they will impeach not only cabinet all Trump and Pence\nAnd if we allow the Democrats the takeover Congress and the Senate they will impeach them and then they will install Nancy Pelosi is our president and Maxine Waters is our vice president\nDo you want that do you want them\nPlease vote this November to keep our house for representatives and our US Senate Republican please tell your friends what is daycare\nOur republic is at stake here our country is at stake here the health him happiness of our children are at stake here in this election pleased exercise you're right and do your duty to vote that choice is yours and I want you to vote no on one twenty seven\nAnd I want you to vote yes on one twenty six\n[noise]\nThis is serious folks now will be a leaving here and we have a caller we're going to get back to that caller get\nAnd it just compelled me to put together my opinion on this you know new and ... and big war that that I hear coming out of the Democratic party\nAre you referring to the big the leader there which is Chuck Schumer\nAnd uh uh and um what's her name from California that are thought the Camelot have an aunt who is a white guy\nShould be beaten up and destroyed\n\nWell that was one of many things that I actually heard them say more on white men so it brought me back to ah you remember in the ... election so we had the war on women\nAnd I don't know if I miss something but the only message I got the only war I got out of that was not not providing free birth control on abortions for women was interpreted as war and many people bought into it\nWho was the person that was the uh person that I really enjoyed that and brought that to our attention her name was miss\nSandra flak [laughter] the way they keynote speaker and the face of the Democratic party she was a headliner at the Democratic national convention\nThere we had a young white woman a privilege in Georgetown University student speaking out to America about her sex life and the cost of maintaining it\nTo her free sex didn't mean whomever whenever but free sex also meant American taxpayers should fit the bill for her costs associated with their choices that was the Democratic message\nThe war on women did get more traction and lasted longer than I expected at that time the war on women was only intended to get voters to vote Democrat to stop the war on women\nAnd here we are coming up on the twenty Eighteen elections and what are the chances we have a war on white man this war again is being shouted out to voters to vote Democrat if you're sick of white men\nThey'll chunky Schumer Chuck E. cheese is a white guy\nUm and\nI don't hear anybody running a war against him\nWell maybe it's the only Republican white guys I Would\nGo along with that statement quite well\nBut they are just saying white guys so white men so I don't know if that does include Democrats I Would think that it was it would because if it if it doesn't now it will eventually I Would\nBelieve it ... it include any Democrat who doesn't agree with the party\nLine I'd I'd agree with you there and when we come back we'll examine what the white men have done for America\nAnd we have how much more time twenty seconds oh a minute and twenty seconds oh I got a um a ... um\n[noise] uh\nYeah Scott what do you think so far her\nHey I I I'm right with are a lot and she can you know they're using women as a weapon\nThe weaponized with women and all these women you ... on the Internet you're seeing that are doing all this ...\nIt's all being paid for it's all being orchestrated and that right now as they call them all in one little area or Trump is filled up a place for Ken Ken eleven twelve thousand go get be lucky to get like maybe ...\nYou're probably

I Hope that for her messages\nThat she has been talked to buy the a ... a\nCommittee sent told people [laughter] yeah um by the secret service\nBecause she was making threats against every buddy values have any power in lately she's making threats against all of a White House staff and all of the cabinet members\nThis girl needs to get a lesson in humility and also the lesson and smart as she doesn't have one\nWell maybe a lesson in her job description that doesn't include inciting violence in America [laughter] that's a good point well I don't want a war on white men or women I don't want a war on black lives or Hispanic lives no war on police ice politicians\nKnow in in this younger generation can even imagine a war saying nothing about fighting in what they can't even handle the truth without a safe place to hide ...\nAre you talking about this ...\nThat is the younger generation citizens from every country in this world want to come to America whether they came in legally swam\nWalked across the desert stayed on a visa overstay their visa came through relative or refugee status the American dream of freedom and equality is why they're here\nIt's our duty and obligation as Americans to vote in November and vote for freedoms and respect for our constitution ... rule of law because if the Democrats take the helm America will resemble the country\nWhose citizens fled and are fleeing the Democrat Party message is very clear a war on white men\nWell not only that they're very clear on wanting illegals I have a very close friend\nWho had to wait twelve years before she could be even apply for citizenship now she is a citizen and yes she has voted\nThis year in their very first\nAh a\nPrimary and she's going to vote in next week or next few weeks next\nOr by November six she is going to have voted in her very first national election\nWhich is as I Know that she is going to be voting who she's going to be voting for she's looking at me for a guidance\nThough and I give ... not only do I give her the the guidance but he also tell her why I like these certain people and a voting yes or no on certain propositions and\nThe [noise]\nBut I gave her the reasoning behind it and I let her think of that reasoning or she came she was raised in the former Soviet Union and she has some stories about\nThat I uh uh some are good summer math\nAnd maybe someday I Will talk her into coming in but so far she doesn't want to talk about it than I Am I won't argue with that [noise] but anyways continue on and\nWell John I'm sure you've told her the Democrat Party stands for open borders eliminating ice free abortion and birth control at taxpayer expense liberal judges\nMore taxes for all gay and impeaching Trump who's done more for our country than any president we can remember since Reagan\nYou know it's funny you mention that because she has been asking many questions that she's listening\nTo what's going on against Brett Kavanaugh how they have a tactic him and how even the New York times\nPut out a cartoon sing that ten year old daughter of Brett Kavanaugh please God help him to help my daddy not attacking him more women\nAt such a joke [laughter]\n[laughter] that was my uh my big thing last week they had me so sad\nBut I Will end is just by saying race and gender mean everything in the land of the free according to the Democrat Party white men are just their latest target they're hoping for a hate wave to sweep our country\nThis is not your dad's Democrat Party in fact your dad has just had more waged on him\nYou know it's funny you say that because\nThat John Kennedy John Fitzgerald Kennedy was a Democrat\nUm and he did many things that a Democrat would have he lowered taxes\nHe lowered taxes on the rich from Ninety percent down to Seventy percent and then Reagan took it from Seventy down to thirty five percent and look what the economy did after that then of course Lyndon\nBaines Johnson needed a needed more money so he stole from Social Security installed and raise taxes on air every money and uh just did a lot of things\nNow yeah anyway sit at that I find that\nVery interesting and some of the things I Want to mention that have happened to me as a white man\n... we only have the Democrats doing it but we have other movements in here that are doing things against white men number one only white men can be racist\nOnly number two only white men can be sexist the er and to accuse\nA person of being sex is all you have to do is be a woman\nAnd say well he did it he uh he was a harassing me what do you do oh I don't know I and we can't tell but I don't want to know what he did but I Know we sexist oh therefore\nWe got to put in his employment record that he was sexist and then he can't get a raise for more for any more simply because I accused him of being sexist\nWhat do you do not I don't know\nMaybe he liked her dress\nThat could be her hair and I got a question for you up there because in one case I was accused of being sexist\nThis happened to me and I said now here's a woman those walking into a group she was dressed to the nines hair cough forward\nBeautifully and I said to another woman she's beautiful\nAnd this woman just lead into me about how that was so sexist or so and I would be destroyed because that was so sexist and I was being so sexist however\nNobody ever accused her of sexism when she was constantly in front of groups saying how she was waiting for hurts that muffin\nTo come through wouldn't you think that sex says she didn't\nWell it's kinda like women can't be sex is kind of like you said earlier about the only Republican men are included in the war on white men so there you go it's not a very fair\nYeah I'm\nSure meetings for a few hours take down a bunch of notes a bunch of ideas for the show and start talking about it start talking about it yeah I I Want to talk about\nTensions more investigation day I Want to talk about how ... is treated in you and\nResolutions with them\nI Want to talk about a bunch of things I Want to talk about non government officials\nOn the state level prosecuting people\nYeah you've heard me\nBut first first\nI Want to raise a glass of pills and you're a beer okay\nI still drink beer on occasion folks and you know what I drank quite a bit of it when I was in college how 'bout that\nYes hey I Need and looked at a keg over my head once an empty one [laughter] when I was a bigger boy I could show them on my shoulders when they were full but but not now not going to try that now now also want to be interaction\nBut here's the number\nNumber is fifty one fifty one is the number [noise] no I'm not talking about\n... bucks not talking about Ichiro Suzuki no\nI'm not even talking about President Trump's approval rating numbers\nI'm Talking about the number of votes\nIt takes and\nTalk to move\nThis forward the geo Peter\nFeed of the Democratic filibuster and are keeping Kavanaugh on track\nLook forward to raising\nA beer and the confirmation is done to him to throw Sam\nTalked about it enough we've talked about it a lot in the past few\nWeeks this confirmation hearing\nThe confirmation hearing where this man's name has been dragged through the mud\nIt's not that it's been dragged it how it's been dragged would no dignity obviously\nYou're going to be thrown out there and when you're running for an office I get it I ran for an office but when you're running for a position as the Supreme Court justice they are going to dig and they are going to look for details they're going to get in there they're going to find out everything they can about you they're going to see hey is this the right kind of person with the right kind of temperament\nPresumed innocent right presumed innocent right rule of law right didn't seem it in this year seems a little bit like a witch hunt\nI forget which one of my fellow casters set it on the year the other day when I was thinking it all along seemed like McCarthyism\nDon't you trust the FBI Senator Feinstein to do their job\nDo you do you not I'm not sure that I always do but they've investigated the man six times now it's been seven they didn't have much more than look at him with the evidence they were Jim and if you want to call the evidence\nThey took that to\nWhat I Would like the FBI to do is to look into Feinstein right now you see what she cooperate and what she put together to try to destroy this man without any real evidence\nHere's a woman that talks about the dogma of people's religious beliefs the dogma regardless of their religious beliefs and that you're not allowed to have\nIn any kind of a discussion when you're going towards the Supreme Court justice you're not really allowed to talk about that that cannot be a basis for deciding if somebody can hold a position or not that's something that's protected for us under our constitution you\nCan't stop my religious beliefs ideologies short go there globally everyone we talked about that on the show ... somebody's religion you\nKnow there is ideology that is politically oriented\n\nNow they're in Christianity or Judaism but I Know of\nIslam yes so they drag it there they drag it here you had news reporters putting false opinions stories out there on the judge you had cartoon is attacking making fun of his daughter for prayer\nWhy why what is wrong with these sick of\nWhat's wrong with these signals\n\nI I don't stand for it I don't stand for it and we don't stand together we we we we fall\nWe all fall I for one would love to have a\nMember of the Supreme Court of the United states of America a nominee\nWho\nLoves our constitution who believes in holding to our constitution not being someone that will create\nNew rules and orders but will that will just in trumpet while based upon our constitution\nNot make law not twisted\nBut to interpret law using our beautiful wonderfully written well well thought out by much wiser men and women that exist\nToday in government and decide it it is legitimate or not under\nThe rule of law I'll tell you what you want to know how a lot of liberal America feels\nWell here's a video I'm going to play for from some prayer interviews out there and this is in Colombia in New York City is this how informed her uninformed\nSome of these kids maybe and you know what no they're not kids they're adults so that makes it even more frightening\nI Lonnie Horowitz and we shot outside of some of the New York city's college campuses to get a sense of what they saw the Brett Kavanaugh him they all seem to have an opinion so we asked these constitutional scholars for some of their thoughts\nWhat do you think I'm from South Supreme Court pick up I don't like it hot like uh [noise]\nSome of them for life and\nCertainly I think our White House is taking ...\nOkay I think it's pretty clear they\nAnd it seems like he's pretty demonize down there but what absurd ideas or the willing to believe just further vilify\nKavanaugh said that he doesn't want me to go to back to a black person thinks we step out on my\nWay to think about he said that\n\nWas oh my God okay now by\nThe people should be in office she knows her fetch awaiting racist idea of the SARS thing that's\nHow I have four or five ...\nBelieve it or not not a single person challenge me on this absurdity plus the Amish father we could go\nOn one thing about the whole family move\nWhen did not have the right to vote right and there was a hostage as you want to say also wants to go back to that and whether or not have known about this he says for what is\nThe king\nOf horrible at each other I suppose really surprised by these\nThings that documentary The Handmaid's tale yeah\nSo I Wonder what are the priorities for choosing a Supreme Court just\nThink that the the role of the Supreme Court today should be more a promotion of social justice as opposed to the interpretation of the competition [noise]\nWe'd be better off if we have a Supreme Court's role what's the amount of social justice and\n[noise]\nI I think sometimes some of the fact that [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] just to\nHave any real relevant to you personally\nUm [noise] no not necessarily\nYou can have made it a little more so than just lost houses\nI don't I honestly suddenly value I can honestly\nReally really\nUm\nHey butter [laughter] that is simply frightening tell you what\nSocial justice that you know what to tell you what we don't like you going to school there were you think
