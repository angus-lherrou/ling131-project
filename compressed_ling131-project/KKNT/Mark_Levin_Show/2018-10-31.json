seven one eight GE AAA mentioned in one seven\nTo ... for three but first please welcome back in the program\nJohn former dean at Chapman University\nThat's what makes you very much taking the time I really do appreciate it\nLarry ... is always a pleasure to be on with the great page in South central\nThank you I Want to talk to you first about uh the caravan then I Want to talk to you about President Trump's assertion that he can change the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment which has been interpreted to allow an illegal alien to come to this country have a child on American soil and that child automatically become an American citizen but first let's talk about the care of and\nTell me what legal authority he has to put troops on the border\nAbout stopping in a date and in the United states has one of the primary reason we have troops\nA dating back to the civil war there's a federal law called the ... in comic heart attack that has the U.S military can be used in the interior of the United states for regular police activity but that's not what President Trump is proposing to do is proposing to put him on the border to stop folks from illegally invading our country\nProfessor how come previous president having done this I mean there's just so called invasion as you put it has happened year after year after year not quite as large but why have another president's done that\nWell because they don't like our immigration laws or they're not willing to enforce them and they don't they don't think about the consequences of what this lawlessness is doing to our society\nLet's talk about consequences professor what happens if somebody gets shot\nWell that's a terrible thing and you know uh uh I'm hoping that that doesn't happen that's clearly what the laughter is funding this caravan is hoping will happen or even better in their view would be that it were a child so we can get the nightly news running confidently then tell them that we now and election day\nBut the fact of the matter is these people are putting themselves and their children in harm's way abide violating the laws in this country they claim that they are refugees and we have an international law obligation to consider their claims for asylum\nBut as far as I've been able to tell them not one of them is making claims that actually fit the definition the legal definition of refugee they're not fleeing their countries because they are being persecuted because of their political or religious\nOr race or ethnic views\nThey're fleeing their country because they want to go to a place that has a better economy that's not one of the ground for refugee status\nWhy hasn't Mexico stop them even after Donald Trump has told them to even after Donald Trump has said he's going to withhold aid from Guatemala and Honduras my resume I have some sort of economic punishment to Mexico Hochul Mexico hasn't stopped them\nWell in the same international law that were require us to consider their claims for asylum required Mexico they consider their claim for asylum as well and that should be stopping now because I was the first country that they entered into really really does make these refugee claim\nUm but but some of them have and I think Mexico with profits profits knows but we don't want to stop and Mexico we want to get all the way the United states which are just further proof that this was an concern about persecution in their home countries that they want a different economy to live and and that's not a ground for refugee status\n[noise] what would happen professor if we allow fourteen or seven thousand so call migrants to to transport themselves through our country going way up to Canada\nWell candidate would stop 'em as well same arena\nYou know there there are legal processes in place here and countries have the ability to define a you know what their immigration and naturalization policies are if if you don't allow that then they're ... you have no such thing as a nation you have no such thing as sovereignty President Trump is absolutely correct on that Without Borders you have no nation\nExplained the grounds for which people can apply for asylum\nWell you've got to have a credible claim of that you are being persecuted under threat of persecution based on your political views your religion you are I'm your race\nYour ethnic background those sorts of things just being poor and wanting a better life exotic ground for refugee status for asylum under international law and certainly not under any other law the United states\nThe president a professor has said that there may be some bad guys there including maybe people from ISIS or even al ... is there any basis to believe that\nWell we we've seen some reports of that I I'm not privy to the intelligence but it wouldn't surprise me\nWhat that border it's porous and if you're stopping people at the port of entry on the east coast in New York or what have you and vetting them properly\nOr than than folks that are in aiming to come here to the United states to do with terrorist harm would see a more poor entry and Mexican border is right now the court entry wouldn't surprise me to find\nA significant number of potential terrorists in this group\nI guess the professor John ... Chapman University school of law professor what about funding you mentioned that this migrant a Caribbean as being funded by the last what do you mean\nAbout you know it made it takes a lot of money to transport seven thousand people to feed them every day uh you know over the span of space that they've gone and it's ... I Want to know who funding it and if they were so poor in their country that they couldn't you know you gotta living who's paying for them\nTo eat on the ... along the way somebody must be doing it and quite frankly it's most likely you know you you just kind of go to the explanation that makes ... that it's most likely somebody that is trying to interfere\nWith the U.S election by setting up a confrontation that doesn't need new media can turn a contrary to President Trump and his supporters\nLet's turn to the fourteenth amendment here's what President Trump said\nRations some legal scholars believe he's getting rid of a scientist and ship without tension between ... and water ... have you thought about the U.S telling all it was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment that\nEven the number one number one you don't need that connection you know very much into well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has it made me and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to end you talked about\nThat with counsel wearing the process in the process it will happen when an executive order that's what you're talking about things but I didn't think anybody who knew that but me I thought it was the only one China as\nAn issue in any do this with an executive order\nWidely ... what's your your first principles the president cannot amend the constitution by an executive order\nCongress can amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court\nIsn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling in a cave I bet that's not what the president is talking about here\nThe constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship\nIt says anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are sort of an all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction Maine\nAnd it doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete that mad or when the lead into the country being part of the body politic and that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear\nThat's what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear\nAnd the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nAre we now so so that would mean that the children of medicine\nOr the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment\nBut the children of temporary visit or whether it's a tourist visa or student visa or um or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution and the president if you're trying to faithfully apply\nThat clause was drafted in ratified and an avid meant to the people that path\nThat forty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties have some sort of footnote which people I'll point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to step rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nAnd it and it takes off a long time\nProfessor my next question was going to be why aren't Californians outrage and I recall studying economics in college ah and and recognizing that the price of these regulations to accept that the price of a of housing but I didn't realize it was at that high fifty percent and if I didn't realize that I think a lot of people are unaware of it as well\n[noise] yes um I think people are becoming more aware of that now given just how rapidly prices are rising I'm only about twenty six percent of California households and this includes households with multiple wage earners\nOnly about twenty six percent of households can afford the median price Tom in California\nAnd people often think about what about all those people that make those high salaries up in Silicon valley\nOr forty two is even worse they're only about Fifteen Percent of households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median price tell them in that location\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's there there's there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about the ... and they're looking for government to to put in place policies that will make it easier and less costly to build a increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I got a fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ah oh lord of the high cost of a of of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things the government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I got a phone call from from some fact checker\nAnd they said how you know the cost of regulation is what you say it is\nA and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people and I recall you telling me that if anything I'd probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefits and and you're not taking them because the racing the benefits that these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection is supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market [noise] when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers I'm most take California's\nLatest folly which is to require by two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required to have solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home by about thirty thousand dollars [noise]\nAll for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to kick solar power offer hand around around noon and one PM [noise] um that type of regulation feeds into [noise]\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun to be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the\nResidential housing market California's not placed regulations really benefiting the consumers\nI'm Talking to UCLA professor ... teaches economics is peace he co wrote is called California housing policy reformers up on Larry Elder dot com professor going to have a few more minutes left more seconds then this break we come back I Want to talk to you about\nA why things substantially changed in California in Nineteen eighty what happened in Nineteen eighty or so and I want to ask you if you have time about the Trump tariffs that the caller was talking about\nAnd what the greed as Obama deserve any credit for this economic boom that we're seeing right now my guess is professor ...
