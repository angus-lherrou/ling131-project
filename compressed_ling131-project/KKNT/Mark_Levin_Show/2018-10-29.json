athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles and real relaxed shape\nThe really wouldn't think that to such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition it's greatly changed and add to that the medication as\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium museum in the system well the very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because his decision and many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's so it's really it's

with Dr Michael ... about stress and the negative effects that everyday stress has on your body whether it's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how your ... formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress and I guess this is something\nEveryone should be aware of whether you're twenty four or Ninety four\nI've used it for many many years as as a younger person and I'm Eighteen [laughter] I use it then it definitely helps me sleep better it helps control the stresses that work in the world and many people will just be amazed how this actually works\nBecause our formula had a chemical reaction occurred before you actually ingested mhm Mac is treated off it doesn't get lodged in your system\nAnd so what happened is that when people drink the ... it's like an infusion into your body is like like compress it and so people who are paying they take the ... the calcium and he didn't get into the muscles and it starts to relax it\nDr figures you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you are to elaborate a little bit more on that subject if you would I mean the stress really affect our energy level\nGood question because energy like the biggest thing right now like people chronic fatigue syndrome PMS fiber my wife and people out and that's the key low energy is a lot of it's caught by paying\nFeeling old your joints don't move well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then they never get tired and you go to sleep you got for it you don't\nKnow I'm telling you like common scenarios total lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the comics and the first thing that happened you take it twenty minutes before you go to bed ... good night sleep and wake up feeling refreshed energy comes back\nIs killing me safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\nComics is never ever been shown to interact with any medication okay it's a hundred percent natural state and you know formula doesn't contain sugar\nWhich isn't a lot of Calvin product wheat gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid doesn't have any of that but you see the point is is that if you're a person has a diabetic and high blood pressure you had bypass surgery guess what\nYou are deficient you are deficient in the calcium and magnesium\nFactor Pincus unfortunately we're about out of time or any any parting thoughts I mean who who can really benefit from this\n[laughter] I Wish we had more time because this this product I'll tell you if you're over the age of thirty five [laughter] definitely be taking the count max formula\nJust daily preventative basis yeah but if you're someone who's more of a senior citizen or if you're someone who can't sleep well or you experienced a lot of muscle cramps a lot of akin in your body this is an absolute it's so simple but it controls most every function and your whole body you're someone\nBut failed all summer seeking asylum in Mexico most of them appear to be continuing the difficult track toward our borders\nSo what happens when and if they reach the U.S that's anybody's guess President Trump is promising to protect citizens from what some describe as an invasion\nJohnson Iraq is senior editor of the stream he's been monitoring the migration and he spoke with say will host Dennis prayer\nYou makes a point there are given that they're fleeing theoretically the persecution this may be a first in history where the country are fleeing persecution from you march with their flag\nRight right I I said I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt to gracefully turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist songs and talking about how they were going to transform or England the U.S in the U.S in Germany the image I mean\nThat the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees from Germany with the German American button you know these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're\nThey're just living in kinda crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason uh for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad to tour a political culture from Spain whereas we inherited a kind of an\nAnti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and\nAs a result they have more government than worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great\nLatin American economists her ... her and I think his name is turn on the court or a ... I think it's ...\nSoto\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from ... from drug lords\nLatin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it\nThey were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people even if they they come in and start working their kids will grow up probably at public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a whole honey pot full of benefits from the government\nSo why don't you think is going to happen when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump should to ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using a defensive funds\nTo start constructing the wall\nYou ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall let Congress scream and yell blood judges scream and yell he should for their court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and you and take money away from gardening Afghanistan's border if necessary to guard at the United states is border\nThat's what we elected him for we didn't like Jeb Bush we didn't elect Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First before him he global policemen you know charity begins at home and is a crucial point I think\nBecause people feel a sense of mall moral ambivalence all\nThese people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world\nIf you are going to say that you if you pick up and Honduras and say this sucks I'm outta here I'm going to the U. S. um if that is enough to get you went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to virtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could see the world in the United states and\nOur welfare system will be bankrupt within you know\nThirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves as we you know starved to death and watch the civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into it what I call Akaka Stan like so many other parts of the world but what about the mall argument\nI think we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes if ... if somebody bags on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room you have the right to shut the door and use whatever forces required\nTo stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country he's our country a common home that we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept new commerce or something to offer\nOr are we just on a giant refugee camp like the ones we see you know in Turkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him in and you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash is you know trash\nCans with a fire is that the future of America\nTo me politically gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important Russia will look right and I I I I worry given the owner bias of\nThe media that we will just have a video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice personal border guard up pushing some mom with the baby\nAnd then uh it's it's it seems to me the when the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets a George Soros funded attorney\nYou know that's not to forgive me job that's not the propaganda war that swimming the war I agree but the propaganda war you know me I I think one of those ... let me let me just breaking point it seems to me that\nThey win if they get in and the women so you don't get it and I don't know because if they are good I Hope you're right I Know a little toys I you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness if he came and then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying we realized the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIt even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turn\nOut I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I'm I think\nIf she's not dance term it's\nEasier to learn that that will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out\nFor its war and otherwise going to turn out to the national impeachment referendum the less space has already fanatical they've got their their anti hurts ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote does not left his all ready at its maximum frenzy\nAnd hysteria they've maxed out what the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base and wake up the patriotic Americans who say wait a minute they're just they're threatening our system of government the destroying an orange that justice oh and now they're bringing in case the doors to transform country demographically by the thousands\nAnd thousands and thousands of no\nNew to John already dot com for the rest of that interview and sign up for the pond cast messed up talk radio every day\nMid week a cluster of bomb scares were reporting to the offices in the homes of a number of Democrats among them George Soros Hillary Clinton and president bronco on you and disgusted with Texas Senator Ted Cruz as you hear in the interview he was learning when we're in China's which is why I'm here today but enough about that enjoy the segment\nWith a Senator Cruz talk to me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages which was a real bomb the president's condemned the vice presidents that Rod Rosenstein I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either some not in a basement or it's a hostile power messing with our election\nBut what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI look at it the media dealing with the media does which which is any any narrative that they can twist against Trump will do so and this is terrible I mean this is terrorism and whoever the terrorist is ... needs to be cost you need to prosecute a nice to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd a and stuff but if that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember some months ago uh we we had the bomber in Austin\nA that was set off bombs throughout all stood and and I met with the the ATF both the FBI or leading the task force at the end of the federal law enforcement had tremendous resources to put\nA to bear it to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I Know there I'm sure they're analyzing all of those now would catch this guy behind bars but but it is long violence is always role\nOr wherever it occurs on the political spectrum light you know we saw tragically a year ago a phrase gunman coming to Washington DC\nDoesn't mean that the voter ID laws weren't racists

one year anniversary is November eleventh\nAnd what advantages do you see now the chair and non smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of or go to want to buy because\nIn some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I wrote almost all my book I all the time and I I Can't although in retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes and the novels that are about getting caught I think there'll be fewer of those but you know it it it helped me come up with certain flights fancy indecent jokes\nAnd they were the creative stimulant in some ways\nBut uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative\nSince I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't it's not as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat it's happening when I was using marijuana so I'm not having the melt down that would characterize sort of my my addiction cycle\n[noise] yeah one thing you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years does your wife ever share your enthusiasm for ah read\nNo and in fact she says the opposite now she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive in some ways it's considered a health food um and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism in my family\nUm and obviously have the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me um maybe it should have you know they've always ducking behind the dumpster

Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers\nDid you first used to wait as a teenager\nWhen I was a teenager let's just you know the Nineteen eighties I was I was sort of a a\nGo getter do

better that the room and stuffy then you end up with something I mean even if it's not a ghost raccoons pretty scary guys so I'm going to that's how we're going to close our vacation vault for this this week but uh I just wanted to share that funny little story with you because\nBoy these things can happen while you're traveling so\nThose are all things that really help you get over the hump of getting started get over your excuses of getting started because it's the first Fifteen minutes that's the hardest\nSo I just want to make sure everybody has these tools so that they don't say oh I Can't go it's too dark I Can't go and scared I Can't go the neighbor's dog about again no [laughter] you get out there All right so now let's talk about reasons you should plan a rest day on your next vacation\nWhether you're planning to travel to haunted house in Arizona or out of state or you're planning another type of vacation if you're going for more than just a few days it's important to have a day where you do nothing\nLike Winnie the Pooh says I Do nothing all the time\nAnd it's the calculator [noise] All right so your body needs rest you\nYou're totally exhausted many times from work and you don't usually want to go hiking for six days straight you know or running you know or\nKayaking or whatever you're doing and venturing you know you need to have a built in day to relax and we often forget that it's okay to cut ourselves some slack and take a vacation that actually involves arrest\nRather than forcing a bunch of activities into a short period of time yes your time is expensive but your health\nAnd not having it can be extremely expensive too\n[noise] so when you finally have an opportunity to take a vacation it can be almost impossible to get off the treadmill you know if you if you will so giving yourself a day to relax it's critical and rejuvenate and revitalize your body in doing so you'll actually be able to appreciate and enjoy the experience a lot more\nSo traveling is not easy as well and it's easy to appreciate vacation when you're looking at beautiful pictures of paradise on line however what most people don't talk about is how hard it can be to plan one\nYes it is if you are the two are director of your family or friends it is very difficult at times to keep everybody on track and moving and picking dates and times and All right so but picking a date and making sure it works with your schedule and finding all these destinations to go to in budgeting for the trip\nLooking for lodging rental car buying plane tickets so the list goes on and on and on\nAnd then once you've actually put the effort into planning a trip you have to actually travel [laughter]\nCramming yourself into the middle seat of an airplane on a long flight or traveling through various time zones driving several hundred miles especially when it's unexpected in your flight gets canceled um can take a toll on your body\n[noise] allow and allowing yourself at least a day to adjust\nTo the changing pace and environment will refresher mindset and give your body a much needed break so kick your feet up hanged by the pool read a book or check out a local cafe keep it low key and relax at least for one day you're like my rhyme [laughter]\nAll right now you won't miss out on anything when taking a day to relax to try to stay away from social media so I have\nAn idea andme our family that's called fun not phones and it's basically extends to the eye pad as well it's easy to get caught up in what other people are doing and have a burning desire to experience what they did\nKeep in mind social media is just a snapshot of someone's life or experience you may think you're getting the full picture\nBut what you're actually seeing is a glimpse of a fragment of reality the person you're living vicariously through probably took more time to relax and you think but it's only sharing daily cliff diving excursions because there are a lot more interesting than a photo them reading a book\n[laughter] although you do see some photos on the beach with a little bit of a book so you need to actively\nYou know light of I'm Sorry\nNot worry about uh the fear of missing out I guess that's called ... for the young people\nYou may think that you're going to miss out on something lights changing by taking a day off from your adventure when in fact you have something to gain an authentic experience to exploring a local coffee shop or getting familiar with your hotel pool\nAre just as valid of travel experiences hiking around the city and touring every\nAnd mark and museum I Know there is somebody in your family that does that it's like no no no we have\nFifteen more things to see let's move let's move people so uh that tends to be me and I do have to be told we have to slow down we need a little break and frankly that is one of the reasons on that show that I have incorporated a lot of coffee shops and bookstores used bookstores because you know buying\nRetail is against by religion by getting into the used book store and get a cup of coffee and the kids the juice and everybody just takes them time to reconnect and read it's awesome and if it's time for the pool that's awesome to okay\nSo an authentic experience means truly immersing yourself in an experience\nLet's say it's your first time traveling to the destination and you spent months scouring the Web to find all of the must see locations pretty soon you're less climbs to twenty must see things now you're up against the deadline stressful\nThat's not really vacationing that's working chances are you are decided you decided to travel to experience something new and live on a new schedule\nSo be free from time constraints don't send your vacation Boston yourself around again I'm guilty of this\nRather than creating a list of twenty must do adventures narrow it down and you know experience each moment slow down you know save or to the lemonade and or the coffee and allow your self to take it all in so All right\nLet's see here now we're gonna talk about one thing that is super important that most people forget\nThis shall we talk a lot about going to places that you can reach by car and there is a reason for that number one spend American number two\nYou know white family time in the car is really really nice bonding time nobody spent time around the fireplace anymore even lock your family and friends and a car and get to know them for real\nBut you know travel pillows are super important as well because again if you're not getting sleep and utilizing that time pretty well\nUh you know you can be tired and grouchy and it won't be as fond of a family experience so whether it's on a plane bus boat ride or a road trip in a car if the conditions are right you might want to get comfortable and snooze through the trip\nSo cozying up in a cramped you know economy the are up against another traveler on a train or bus\nCould leave you feeling that a nap or even a cat naps impossible however with the night the write travel pillow you might change your mind [noise]\nThe market for travel pillows has expanded in innovation presenting
