yourself how it works\nBut it's also going to talk about some things that are upcoming like last week would've talked about well earnings report\nAre reporting is happening you know coming up and that's been happening this past week as we saw a substantial amount of companies reporting and we've got some good earnings out their folks so and we had all this volatility we we just it's it's a\nAn anomaly here right we've got companies that are reporting great earnings we've got good forecasts from the a conference calls from these reports\nUh and yet the markets were having some real challenges it was it was breaking down and we'll talk a little bit about that also though a when you go to the website right on the front pages that website there's a little entry\nOr introductory video that I encourage folks to\nTake a look at and give you a little insight as to who we are so financial planning from\nSome of the services that we provide\n\nAnd just some are good information or on the website when it comes to upcoming workshops and other types of information that can help you plan to be successful in retirement\nOr one of the things are also on the economic update in the weekly communication that you'll get from us talks a little bit about weekly tips or riddles that we have each week just for fun some upcoming events\nAnd I'm One of the things is what's the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of autumn and fall\nAnd if you thought pumpkins and hopefully you celebrated pumpkin day\nWhich was on friday October twenty six just yesterday or not only are pumpkins delicious you know we had uh my wife Tracey brought in some pumpkin muffins for everybody and that was on Thursday we all enjoy those\nUm but pumpkins are out one of the main symbol of Halloween right because we've got Halloween right around the corner as well\nUh coming up on Wednesday or some fun facts about pumpkins the largest pumpkin in the world weighed in about one thousand one hundred and forty pounds wow can you imagine that\nEleven hundred and forty pounds a pumpkin how many pies do you think that would have made I Wonder if the pumpkin or would taste as good right a lot of times the larger\nA pumpkin I Wonder if it would have the same flavor as maybe some of the medium to smaller size pumpkins anyway I don't know I'm not I'm not necessarily be big pumpkin pie kind of a guy but ah I Know a lot of people do like pumpkin pie\nBut he put a little uh whipped cream on anything or ice cream and it tastes good [laughter]\nAll right um you know one of the things we talk about uh each week is a weak little weekly tipped just out there and and and it's interesting because if you think about small business owners I come across this a lot with a small business owners as your business grows\nOftentimes you're so busy working within the business that you don't take the time to really look at some of the tax implications that may be affecting you in some ways that you could be\nHandling that business a ... some type of an entity for your business and utilizing a certain tax strategy to really be tax efficient within your business so having a good relationship with attack professional becomes vital to any small business\nAnd a federal tax professional can help you file correctly to make sure that you're not I'm missing any of the important deadlines to take advantage of certain deductions that you're legally entitled to sew a variety of benefits I Believe can come out of working with a skilled\nA tax professional and in most cases folks just because someone is a CPA doesn't necessarily mean that they work\nOut with business owners maybe they're a CPA that really just works with individuals so you need to seek out a a good affirmed to be able to make sure that you're getting the proper advice and I believe a long term that the cost that you may curve for that advice\nOr will the benefits far outweigh the cost is what I'm saying so I Know for myself I rely heavily on a sheep a CPA for our firm and he's on my show regularly he'll be on the show later today Darren cigarettes\nYou hear him all the time on the show\nA there for him as a nice medium sized firms that can handle a just about any type of\nA tax need whether it's individual or a small business medium size or even large businesses\nAre to be able to help you uh work through the the details and the intricacies of the tax laws that we all face out there things are constantly changing when it comes to taxes and want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of what's available and that we're not\nUh trying to take advantage of something maybe that is no longer available and then we don't want to ever get that letter in the mail about a you know from the IRS saying uh you know we found a discrepancy on your tax return okay so that's just my weekly tip\nOr we also talked about the real each week let me get through this real quick we talked last week's rental recap was what is the longest word in the dictionary\nAnd the answer is smiles because there is a mile in between it [laughter]\nOh well that's a cute one but this week thread oh what is seen in the middle of march and April that can't be seen at the beginning of either month what a scene in the middle of march and April that can't be seen at the beginning of either month\nSo hopefully you guys or work on that that's a tough one I don't know about that I don't have to look that one up myself art of ants this week of course we had some big big things happened this week how many have you bought a lottery ticket\nAnybody I Know I bought some I don't buy them every week but I did I bought a lottery ticket or and ah unfortunately didn't win even if I Won though I Would have still been on the show today so [laughter] just to let you guys know how dedicated I Am um [noise] but one person one\nThe one point six billion I think it was or close to two billion dollar a mega million jackpot or someone in South Carolina so if you've got any relatives in South Carolina that have gone dark you'll understand why because they probably are the one that one or the or\nThe mega million jackpot wow that's that's amazing what would you do if you one after taxes it was just a little under a billion dollars and that's amazing isn't it it'd be hard to understand what to do at that point but it'd be fun trying to understand what to do I would I Would love that opportunity as I'm sure many of you would have as well [noise]\nAh on another note which is a horrible thing explosives apparently were sent to a variety of\nUh individuals Hillary Clinton Obama Joe Biden CNN investor George Soros a Robert De Niro I'm you know obviously these are all a very active individuals uh in the Democratic party\nA but boy this is a horrible thing I Know the president did come out and and now these things as he should have\nAnd all of a talk radio has done it as well\nUh ... obviously this is not something that anyone wishes or any type of harm to come to anyone like this and and and we hope that they find the individuals who have done this and can make them a you know\nOr go to the court system and hopefully put them in jail for for this this is certainly something that should never happen and hopefully it never will again but unfortunately a lot of people out there that do things like this\nUm but anyway a showcase folks are going to take a short break and we come back to the break we're going to get into the meat and potatoes of some of the volatility that had occurred this past week I'm sure\nA year a little bit nervous about that wondering is the um is this correction over or are we still in the middle of it is it going to get better is it going to get worse what

his Bible museums or giant it's a giant big thing that probably a lot of people haven't heard about ... published but it's a big museum with a lot of\nAntiquities or supposedly antiquities and it's

show\n[noise]\n\nAll right John John brush to hear the word on well going to be with you here for one more segment and I'd like to talk a little bit about\nOftentimes I get questions about what else can I be doing to put money away from my retirement and this this question comes up a lot with with individuals or I Will actually proposed the question to new ah clients of mine or existing clients or when I asked them well how much are you\nContributing to your current retirement accounts and are based on their income based on their cash flow ah it's going to determine whether or not they can contribute more maybe they shouldn't even contribute as much as they are oftentimes I find they're asking what else can I be doing which is a great question for you to ask when it comes to\nReally uh pushing your a retirement accounts and building up the value of those accounts as quick and as fast as you can't\nBring on I'm a CPA with us here as many of you know down cigarette as a secular strict Potter and high salaries a CPA here in Scottsdale\nAnd want to talk a little bit about uh what else folks can be doing Darren tax wise or to contribute to their retirement account if they're already participating in what what we would call an employer sponsored plan such as four one K. for all three B a four fifty seven plan those types of plants\nSo what I like to propose to you is I've got an email question here I'm going to paraphrase that and folks sent me this email questions did dear John at the word on wealth dot com that year John at the word I'm well that kind of we'll get to some of those emails throughout the shows\nAll right there and so this particular uh email talks about that I'm already contributing to my four one\nK. about eight percent of my income great um I don't know what your income is didn't stayed here but that's OK percent of the income oftentimes people will do a certain percentage of their income down because the company match is a certain right All right so they say okay well since you're going to match up to this point that's what I'm going to contribute\nSo that happens All right okay so now they're asking about what else can I be contributing to uh to build my net worth okay great question so\nIt was a great question yeah and and again one of the interesting parts of it is\nThe IRS has some ... maximum contribution levels Eighteen thousand five hundred dollars is the maximum if you're over fifty\nThey would they have what's called the catch a contribution of another six thousand dollars that's a big number big numbers yeah you can do up to twenty four thousand five hundred dollars into your for when the plant and then a calendar year with ... right\nAnd but but it's a confusing topic because a lot of people confuse\nThe maximum contribution with the amount that the company's matching as you mentioned correct so maybe they match up to four percent maybe right match up to six percent that's not the maximum the Irish fallout it's okay to make contributions even though your employers a magic pill range of all the mansion you can\nBut you can keep contributing and it it's always surprising to me how many people asked me the question\nHey I'm contributing and my four one too but I'd like to contribute to my eye or a town or an Irish John I Want to put her with an additional sixty five hundred dollars and then I look at their W too and see the you know they only put six thousand or a thousand dollars into into their four one K. right right well the quickest way for them to remedy that is\nGo ahead and start putting another sixty five hundred dollars into your ... to ... or if you care more yeah or whatever you're you're you can budget I'm yeah I'm In and that is\nThe first thing but if you're fully contributing to your four one K. ... four thousand five hundred dollars you're over fifty years old\nThen it becomes a little more difficult because uh depending on what your income level is and probably if your income level is high enough to be that big of a contribution\nYou very well may be ... if you're a purchase went on a plan many times you can contribute to an irony right under the cause of your income and because of your income rivals right um so in that situation\nAgain you you can certainly do what's called a backdoor off among contribution what that means you're making ... traditional Irish contribution um so it doesn't reduce your taxable income right and you turn around and you can work that now the ... contribution to raw fire right right\nBut now there are rules that apply to that restrictions of course if you got additional IRAs out there there's there's a lot of this is not just a simple thing not a sample cases by some cases it could be\nBut um you know for those out there who have IRAs if you've got a substantial IRA as well as your four one K. and things can get a little bit more complicated but working with a good CPA folks and a good financial planner you can get these uh additional contributions done little extra work but it can be done\nA little extra work and if you don't have much in your and other traditional area down to a great strategy write something to consider it's not necessarily something to do\nRight exactly right so just you want to understand it before you make that decision ins by talking to the right people All right so appreciate that you know get folks if you have questions anything financially could send us email questions to me at dear John at\nThe word on wealth that calm but I tell you sometimes have to take my glasses off three down you're not wearing glasses we have contacts now actually I don't know so you don't wear contacts are glasses I Donald booth who do you do for a well give it a few more years anyway [laughter]\nThat's what I've been hearing for years so [laughter] they're starting to go to service you feel better yeah that makes me feel much better fires and get fined print can be tough yes uh against upset me this email questions severe John at the word I'm up that come right there so let's just kind of generally talk here we're coming up to the year end really were were you know we're almost now\nI Will we are in the fourth quarter right and we've got 'em all sorts of uh corporations right now are reporting\nEarnings out there and it's been a a an additional a bit of volatility out there uh there is always opportunity for folks out there if they're working closely with their advisor or during periods of volatility possibly either to take some profits off the table\nOr depending on your length of time that you have to invest\nOr maybe even buying more uh uh some of the holdings that you have to take advantage of these little ... if you've got the cash available\nAnd that's a difficult thing right for a lot of people are because markets going down and and it it's almost like if you're in Vegas and they're banning and you're losing and losing and losing and you go well I gotta when so many more right ah but it's a little different in the stock market right because\nYou're investing for the long term whereas in Vegas you're going for the quick hit here just friend trying to make the quick you know profit and hopefully leave the table if if you do hit it big\nAh which most people do write write some underlying value who supposedly the equities [laughter] exactly right but but my point was Darren is is for those out there maybe who um do you do get a little nervous or did get a little nervous during this period of volatility\nThere are options for them because most often times your portfolio may have some winners and you may have some losers within the portfolio so if you're thinking about making some type of a change or we balance of the portfolio you might be able to take advantage of some of the winners\nAnd off so offset some of those gains by selling some of the losers\nRight right and a lot of situations we talked about a ... year end starts getting closer and closer harvesting your losses right and what we mean by that is just you can offset capital loss was against the capital gains right oh if you do have a lot of games when your portfolio if you have a even if you think you've got some mutual funds that are going to throw off\nSome capital gains ride distributions um it's it's not a bad time to start thinking about re allocating your portfolio and offsetting taking some of the ... the waffles off the table and maybe re allocating that\nPortfolio is kind of counterintuitive when you think about it down on your saying take some of the harvest some of the law says 'cause most people want to harvest the gains they want to see the right off it in a lock and again remember folks if you've got some holdings at you you you have in your portfolio that you really love and you've got some games and those\nUh yeah you can sell them and you can you can lock in the game but there's a rule out there that says you can't go right away and buy back into that that holding and just to take advantage of those gains and and uh you know at as a short or long term\nGame right that right yeah well ... and so what you can do you watch the altar or a big deal right you can you know so a sizable off and then by ... and\nSo there are some rules that you have to worry about 'em you know what what I see a lot of clients doing is managing through their portfolio working at the games if they've got a lot of loss of those they sell those positions\nRight so and and that just a simple way to do it while you're not going to go right back in ... next week but it thirty days as it is that the the it's the ... yeah the wash last roll right show folks if you did do something like that you can thirty days later if you like that position you want to buy back and again you feel it's the right time now you can show that the strategy that oftentimes\nIt's an anti freedom movement it's really not about guns it's about freedom whether or not you're free to keep and bear arms or somebody's in control of you\nAnd how much concealed carry well that sounds like you're hiding something I'd prefer to think of it there's discreet carry because in modern times discretion is the better part of valor [noise] I\nDo agree with that ... a lot um guns kill\nNo criminals kill\nGuns protect guns or tools to the left would vilified the things that keep\nUs free and they distort the entire picture the media has picked that up right now we're hearing a lot about shooting\nShooting is a very honorable and noble pursuit\nAnd they should be talking about murder which is a crime and horrific and if they did we'd all be up in arms up in arms against murder\nShooting happens to be the number two participant sport in America but you wouldn't know that it's it's more popular than Gulf\nBut really who knows yeah golf is number three the shooting sports is number two and number one is exercise but you see what a distorted picture you get\nFrom the media and they talk about the shooter and shooting and all good Americans or shooters and go shooting and we all should\nIt's a birthright it keeps America free it's a decent sport we do it in the Olympics it like I said it's the number two participants sport in America but if you follow the news you would never know that\n[noise] uh guns are bad [noise]\n[noise] no they're not guns are fun [laughter] criminals are bad\nAnd guns are I'll add to what you just said guns or why America is still free let's look at and moral ... told\nOh right go ahead way me story\nYeah he said the only reason Japan did not attack America was because there's a bullet behind every blade of grass yeah that is true yes\nYes it is true and we are free because we still have guns and we have a little thing in a Second Amendment says a ... a ... that says shall not be infringed\nWe're working on a bill on that but getting back to the blade of grass I just put out an essay gun laws dot com which is where you can reach me\nAbout Amnesty International they're talking about these horrible abuses and they've got a list of about a dozen countries where these abuses are going on human rights violations murder torture assassinations rape pillage\nOf entire populations and the only reason that happens\nIs because the populations are unarmed\nThey couldn't do it if the populations were armed but their own armed so these desperate some tyrants do whatever they want and there's no resistance\nNow are you saying that since Hitler took away guns in Nineteen thirty two with his Nineteen thirty to bill\nTo take away guns I use saying that he caused that cause the murder of six million Jews in six million other undesirable\nA deplorable ... know undesirable Z um it's it's much more complex than that but you can persecute unarmed populations in a way that you can't\nIf the population is armed and this is a debate that's gone on for a long time or Stephen Halbert just wrote a book where he tied to disarm 'em into the Jews and the Holocaust what really gets me is the Jews and progressive and liberals right now I\nFeel like the government is run by a neo Nazi\nAnd they want to turn their guns into the government\nThat is so irrational it's hard to believe\nGive up your guns guns are unsafe turn your guns in we don't want guns they're too dangerous and they want to turn them into the government yet they believe the government is totalitarian\nIts its insanity its ... phobic it's a morbid fear of weapons couple of phobia and its irrational a there's a problem that just broke out in Pittsburgh same problem nobody there who could defend themselves\nIt was a person goes crazy and you have to wait for guns to arrive to stop the problem of unarmed mad man\nIt sounds like something like a dial nine one one and die\nThat's a book that a J. P. F. O. published choose for the preservation of firearms ownership that was written by its founder now deceased errands Oldman and his co author or a lawyer who's actually here in Phoenix or Richard Stevens\nDial nine one one and die documents the laws in all fifty states showing that none of them require the police to defend or protect you the police have a general obligation to the public but\nNot to any individual sort of your counting on them to protect you it's a false premise there is no protect and serve as a matter of law and dial nine one one and die by J. P. F. O. dot org has the documentation and the statutes spelled out\nAnd we have a Supreme Court case it says exactly what you just said we have many yeah it was the one I'm thinking of was a\nWho is in the second district a second district went to the Supreme Court three girls were a couple of guys broke into their house three women one ... one was a mother with her daughter\nAnd the three women were cap for a total of about twenty four hours and raped repeated repeatedly by this guy\nHe went or after that to was taking care of\nThe girls sued the city of Washington DC for not protecting them because eight or ...\nAn officer did drive by when she called she called and said we need to have the uh please share because my friend downstairs being raped\nThey drove by the house slowly didn't see anything in ... and going each\nThen when they were done things were quiet downstairs or done all the first woman they said\nHow are you a ... ... talk downstairs said how are you can guess what both guys came upstairs and had their way with the other two women for another nine hours\nAnd the next case went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court in the majority opinion said I Wish I had it right here I'd read it to you but that it said and I'm paraphrasing that the police have no obligation to protest too you\nKnow that's true of the most recent case I'm aware of is um [noise]\nCastle rock Gonzalez similar case a woman\nColds on her estranged husband who's holding their children on stage\nAnd she pleads with the police to send help ah the dispatcher ignores it goes to lunch and the strange has been kills the children\nAre there's another case the Winnebago case where the the Supreme Court finds that there's no responsibility of the police to protect any individual some of these cases are heartbreaking but there's\n... ... you're responsible for yourself in the Bible you're responsible for yourself and reality and as a practical matter when seconds count the police are just minutes away\nThat's right and in some cases like Graham county there Fifteen to thirty minutes away\nOr the average response time there are studies on this is ten minutes thirty minutes depends on where you are the first responder is always you\nAnd yes Elise or second responders at best yes but the media will tell you the first responders and you see the marching around looking like space minute gigantic outfits and they get their afterwards and they strained yellow tape\nAnd they don't draw their guns they draw truck lines when you're gone\nYes absolutely [noise] um we've got one minute left and I want to mention today in history the federalist papers at first so the federalist papers were were\nPeople think the Supreme Court's been quiet on guns or that the Heller case or the McDonald's case both of which I was invited to observe that the Supreme Court that those are the definitive cases they're not all Ninety two cases are consistent\nWith an individual rights reading of the second amendment\nYou have a right to keep and bear arms and it's not\nYou know they just had this is a lower court case that found a the A R Fifteen is not a weapon of war so you can have it you can have weapons of war what did they expect you to have tyrants who go to come at you with weapons of duck hunting\nYou supposed to be able to resist tyranny with the most horrific weapons imaginable so you can stop tyrants who were trying to do harm you're not supposed to have peace shooters\nThat just infuriated me\nBeing the interpretations and understanding in the media and enhancing the public or not where they should be there not accurate than a historical they don't reflect reality and nobody stands up and questions it except on the show like yours Jon or gun laws dot com where I Do my work\nWhen when do you suppose that America lost its values in the press\nOh there's a great question well if you go back historically people have complained about the ... press since the very beginning in the early Eighteen hundreds of politicians complained the uh uh ... made it illegal to challenge the government uh when did we get to the point where now\nThey may be the fifth Nineteen fifties in Nineteen sixties um but they have been some place like this all the time the horrific left wing slant and the media than we now face is relatively new I could probably write a couple of books on that\nVery subject and there are some out there I did do one call bomb jokes at airports [noise]\nYes I read that too\nTo a document all the things you're no longer allowed to say and this business about racism everything is now racist I decided everybody's racist because everybody likes to hang out with their own kind\nI'm I'm going to argue with you on that one because the only people that are racist are white white people specifically white men\nIt's not true they want you to think that but women or racist against men men are racist against women everybody's racist against everybody else there are now\nPeople who look completely white who were black there are people who claimed to be black who aren't black and now you have this people of color but you can see colored people colored people is racist but people of color is not racist but then the same thing\nYou're not talking about you I noticed you haven't mentioned focus Hamas\nFolk heart this that's kinda cool I heard that when Trump was a waiter at a restaurant and wouldn't serve her because she didn't have a reservation\n[laughter] it was as bad I saw that somewhere I I like it

to be secure in their persons houses papers\nAnd the facts against unreasonable searches and seizures and that's not what I wanted to read [noise] [laughter] that's a good one but it is a good one because it's been violated destroyed\nAnd that's the fundamental flaw in the U.S constitution\nThere are no penalties attach for violating the terms\nSo shall not be violated and know Warren show issue but upon probable cause supported by oath of reformation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons of things to be seized so if the officials come in\nAnd take your stuff without a warrant without particularly describing the things to be seized all without an oath\nWhat happens nothing so there's no punishment in this constitution for people who infringe on your rights so Arizona has introduced twice and will again the Arizona protection of arms act which defines infringement\nIf you take a gun that's legal\nAnd you declare it illegal fats infringement so let's say John overhear owns and they are Fifteen\nPerfectly legal and the governor the governor and the government suddenly declares they are Fifteen so now contraband by definition that would be infringement\nShall not be infringed rely on it it's my legal property the Fourth Amendment protects it the second amendment protects it than ninth and tenth amendment protected I own it you can't take it that's banned and so now it will be infringement by definition under this statute we've\nIt's illegal to infringe on firearms it's as though right in what you read and let's define it so now which define debts infringement it's banned for what happens if you act against then infringed item\nThat's aggravated infringement it's a crime and now the officials face punishment\nThat's what we want to see felony punishment for violating our constitutional rights since the constitution has this tragic for like a Greek tragedy there's no punishment\nThey have to suffer punishment for violating the terms of our basic shorter and you can't infringe on the right to keep and bear arms we have to spell it out\nSpell out the punishment that's the purpose of law if you read my book my very first book the Arizona gun owners guide it starts out with a list of reasons for law which are in the law and one of them is to spell out what's allowed what's not allowed and what the penalties are\nAnd the constitution doesn't do that so we'll do it in statute you can't take away people's guns because that's banned and if you try to you go to jail\nBut I'm just a moderate as you can tell\nYou I can tell that the problem is is you're a moderate in my book I Am a little bit more to the writer that anyway\nI'm a moderate in any book or a low taxation individual responsibility capitalism free markets delegated powers due process rule of law\nThat's the fundamental set of values religion morality ethics this is what the constitution the United states is about this ... this is moderate this is not right wing ownership of guns\nDelegated powers only this is what America is about that's moderate the left with cast you as a wild ride radical but they're the wild eyed radicals his like racism the person who charges racism\nTypically is the racist\nAnd that's what we have to stop we're losing our way our moral compass has been affected that is why J. P. F. O. was such a valuable group they set their moral compass to do north and they stay focused\nMhm [noise] I'd like to read to you another part of the constitution and then I'll give you my question sure the section for of article for\nThe United states shelled guaranteed to every state in the union a Republican form of government and shell pro packed each of them against invasion\nAnd on the application of the legislature or of ... when the legislature cannot be convene against domestic violence now we have a\n... a\nPosse common Tavis law that will not allow the federal government to do domestic inspiration insurrection a or put it down they it has to be called up by the governor and they have to ah [noise] ah [noise] mobilize the\nUh the what started out as a militia but became the national guard\n... don't exactly agree with that but I Know where you're going\nYeah but what's the question the question is\nThe last couple of Democrats have come out and said that Trump cannot\nGo to the border with a military troops to stop the invasion of seven thousand and I heard even won a journalist say fourteen thousand uh what's the number who knows but\nThere is one Democrat and I think it was ... cheese Schumer that said and I have no respect to that guy 'cause in his he's an idiot I is the cause\nThis he said that Trump does not have so we just gotta let them in\nSo the question is can we prevent an invasion across our border yes\nI think the answer's yes and the Democrats by and large have been arguing that our borders don't matter and that's very upsetting to many people um ... what's the actual answer\nIt's really a ... valley in power politic\nIssue if you put troops and you stop an invasion than you stop the invasion if you don't stop the invasion than people come in and they assimilate or not they vote or not to use your services or not and it is really power politic\nOr what is the last say\nIt'll go through the courts you'll have people arguing it's it's gray it's whatever you want it to be what's the old joke about the umpire or\nThe pitches a I call them as I see them or they would this three in the last one is the ain't nothing until I call them [noise]\nSo what is it really Chuck Schumer would like to be what he thinks it is but his team\nAnd Trump wants to be what he thinks his team the teams don't agree and the legal precedent doesn't even matter you can make a case either way but here's here's the correct joke for this the defense gets up makes its case and the judge says you are right\nThen the prosecution gets up and makes its case and the judge says your right so the bailiff gets up and says but your honor they can't both be right then the judge says your right to\nSue can we use troops you mentioned posse coma taught us that's a little different the passing coma Titus law says you can't use the military to enforce civilian all so\nShort of insurrection or riot you can't bring out military troops like they do in a banana republic and enforce a shoplifting and and robbery you can't do that and in fact when the FBI was called in\nBecause of a shooting in a temple I wasn't so sure that this jurisdiction there but they ignore these things like they ignore the Fourth Amendment and there's no punishment for officials who violate their old for that delegated powers so we're almost completely out of control\nNow there was a another case and the Supreme Court print smack versus Clinton right that actually sad and I knew you were there for the reading of that\nUh [noise] that actually said that the ... is the sheriff\nI wasn't actually there for that and ah wasn't it was a Mac prince V. [noise] it was us the United states\nYou know it wasn't the Clinton but that was the Lopez case in Nineteen Ninety five where they wanted to commandeer the sheriff to enforce a federal requirement and you can't do that the\nNineteen Ninety two is a Brady Bunch law\nYou know it was the ... I think it finally went Ninety five but um and I I could be wrong and that I wrote an unabridged guide to Supreme Court gun cases as well as gun laws of America which is another branch guide to federal statutes also available at gun laws dot com or you could just read about it I have most of the\nCases posted um\nWere completely out of control at this point posse coma Titus is not really

Coast ... number three is\nShipped tackle if Chicago was a country\nNo but if you look on that chart the United states is number a hundred and eleven yes we're about five from the bottom and\nBut go rely on the media for statistics and I don't like statistical arguments and there's your right to defend your life is not subject to cost benefit analysis the stats on what matter you're allowed to defend your life period if it's in jeopardy\nI fully agree with that but stance is how is the way I like to defend what we're doing\nAnd go ahead and do it but you can't tell me that there's a hundred
