he looks out a picture of him in the paper because we're so I get the water or tell me what the hardware store do I get the pipe what about this other stuff\nWell the reality is is that individuals

R. at AOL dot com and a lot of you've done that and you'll find out on my website and all these other sites where I Will be appearing next besides filling in for learning or dentists or whatever\nI Do other stuff to\nWash our talked about the effort of the left to blame these would be bombings on President Trump because the left and the media and the Democrats hate him\nIn this segment I Want to talk about what a great job in the ... a ... at the end of the other our asked me to do that what is it you're done that's so good I think he didn't think there was anything but I Want to talk about what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office\nI said for months now that I care less about what he says and much more in what he does\nHis tweets are not always helped him and he's in my opinion is after many people who shouldn't\nAnd engaged with people beneath his position to his detriment I I play tennis a lot and uh when uh sometimes on the court people come to know who I Am and they try to get my vote I just don't answer them off and I am I getting paid for this book and paid I'm not answering your guts\nBut he talks and you know get some debates with people who shouldn't\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way he's far surpass my expectations for him I must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season I was actually a Ted Cruz delicate in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John ...\nWhich isn't saying much cause ... will be a Democrat\nBut I have long submitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may have very well being the only Republican that could have one\nIn fact I've wondered a lot of the callers suggested this last hour if profit Providence was involved in this election after off a bomb had done you know talking about radically changing our country it might have very well been too late to turn America\nHillary had one and I don't know if you know Bruce ... he ran against Barbara Boxer the but when she ran for the U.S Senate and I asked him if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country and the answer of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd what is it also Providence I Wonder that we got George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nYou'd get no argument from me about gods involvement and now I think we got Donald J Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most yesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't matter much either considering we train against and\nRemember many of us thought he would be very satisfy we would be very satisfied if President Trump will just nominate conservative judges especially for the Supreme Court so I thought were way ahead of the game when he point the judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court\nBut he didn't stop there\nLet me go through the list that the caller wanted ending the Obamacare mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline than Anwar reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy\nA significant tax cut I don't know why and he talks about it but not enough Republicans do lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly produce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\nGetting American remains he's already done that returned from North Korea\nMaking sure our borders means something yeah color from last hour who knows what people are up to there just isn't it a coincidence that the coming right around the election and a mom who knows how they're getting paid how they're supporting themselves yeah I've heard local church groups and so on\nBut this isn't just organized spontaneously\nAnd of course the naming of his second Supreme Court a choice a few weeks ago and he was successful another I'm Brett Kavanaugh the list goes on and on and the American people love that he is not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who spinning and spinning and spinning that's where we are talking about last hour and are afraid to say what they are really thinking you don't have that problem\nYou can never say that about President Trump he may say too much but he never has two little he is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he has done a great job and most of the American people get it but it doesn't matter to the left\nOr the Democrats or their comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left is the Democrats and liberal listeners so maybe I'll watch for this\nIf the presidential election were held today\nPresident Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nYou are dreaming if you think he's going to be defeated you a failed to get rid of him but not for lack of trying you started the day he won\nActually we now know that they start their resistance again him against the much before election day but was election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had won\nSo bumbling but he's still one no matter what the upper lead of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed he won\nAnd I was almost I mentioned this last hour in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania\nWhich always seemed like a Republicans fool's gold you know we're always going to win a Romney who's gonna win ... W was going to win it but not only did he win but there despite their best efforts he want he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the color persecution\nOr is that prosecution got to think about that we was uh which one is that no matter the hostile media no matter the never Trump spurs no matter all the elites and the swamp President Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor point to\nAnd including the best efforts in terms of the bomber he won't work even though they won accused him of being responsible for the bomber he's accused of everything and anything they can come up with he still hear\nIt never should have happened with the more investigation if not for Jeff Sessions as an aside I'm disappointed you never recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nBut typically politicians talk to our adversaries re did it she talked to the Russians remember the reset button remember Obama saying that he was reelected that he would take care of it and you know they work work it out and he promised that off Mike\nAnd a bakery and I'm Seventy four and um go working uh-huh I'm a grandmother or grandchildren and I believe in shut the wall built that wall and I will work for that\nYes you might be you might be interested I had a caller another show another network\nAnd his whole argument was walls never work in the long run and I said to him first so I don't even accept your ... your ...\nWhat are you in if it was true that they don't work in the long run they sure as heck work in the short run tell that to the Israelis who are being attacked by Hamas and Hezbollah you know when they try to get over and that they've knife to kids in the middle of the night\nUp to tell that to anybody who you know is worried about what could happen to them tell up to people with the Berlin Wall right it sure worked there whether it was on our side so you know when we got rid of it or not ending we gave them freedom of course they try to use the Berlin Wall against us but that was not to to keep people\nFrom coming in and that was from TB people from leaving\nWants to work in the short run\nAnd it's important it's not the only thing we need to do as you say but it's one of the resources we need to have taken place just sink with the caravan I don't even know some colors ... what are we going to do right excuse me\nCan I get tired of that shot a caravan what me another data yeah yeah yeah that's right the language is really not a hundred million kind\nYep you're right it's not a ...\nPre planned and people are suffering because of the ... the money that the older one batter and money and destroy Crump they come in the country you don't know who's going to get murder who's going to get chopped up recording it killed what how to get by according to people wake up\nYour hair I have an alarm or my hand everything has a lawn cutting all the politicians [laughter]\nYup why that arise from Ben in the Hollywood campaign out there we protect our country\nExactly exactly I I was going to talk about illegal immigration will probably save it for money a Monday when I shall incidental ... but you're absolutely right we would never let anybody would know documents come into our house and say you were undocumented right to that would be illegal we'd never let anybody go to a bank account and said to the bank I just don't have a right documents but give me the money\nGive me marks money no one would ever allow that which you allow people to recognize\nWater's got four hundred million dollar home she got her and she's got a laundry got everything after a short trip on border come to you got to have her second\nI ...

think the Democrats overplay their hand let's go to Joe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania you're on with mark\nHey mark I just don't understand I Can't get this through my head why Hillary Clinton isn't being held accountable when she opened recalled for civil unrest last week um until the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience\nGo wackos or want to come out of the woodwork and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but Joe she's on the other side she can say anything she wants\n[laughter] right [laughter] I you

[laughter] you're not hearing anything about the cabin anymore yeah you're a great\nIn fact a ... you know I I agree with you if there was any thought that illegal immigrants who are voting for Republicans in huge numbers certainly even in a majority\nWhy do I have a strong feeling that the Democrats would be against illegal immigration like they were four years right there are a lot of clips from bite into a Clinton or to Hillary Clinton all of them are against illegal immigration but now it's convenient and they need the vote by the way\nIf they lose a minority votes in the proportions that Trump seems capable of doing the words they Democrats are always get what Ninety Ninety five percent of voting Obama's case if it ever starts to go the other way they are in huge trouble\nBecause that's what they count on that count as I mentioned the store with large month that they cannot just wrote here's what we do we vote for the Democrats they care about the poor the fact that they have and help the poor the fact that if you look at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like in inner cities none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side they have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them that it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from minorities because they don't know\nThey don't know that a lot of the stuff they've been hearing and listening to all these years has done them no good\nThey told over and over again Republicans are evil they hate you for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business and all my time\nMost of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly it wasn't a Trump vote for Hillary Clinton so this idea that Republicans for for of our big business and the Democrats and the poor and the people who and we had a court challenge me on that or for the poor and and the disenfranchised each not true\nAnd that's what President Trump appeals to\nAnd people because one of the things that gets him in trouble like everything in life there's a balance theory also helps them they know he says what he's thinking there is none of this being and all the stuff the politicians usually do would you say one thing and then lose another way to do with a different way\nThis guy is different he's surprised me he says some things on Twitter and do you know ... some things you wish you wouldn't\nBut the American people are thrilled that they finally got a president that standing up for the United states of America finally got a president that understands that free enterprise is the thing that builds everybody\nThis is what makes America special it was

... and the bernadine darn I'm not talking about the FAA all and they got all the parts from Clinton and so we are no no I'm Talking about this guy\nAnd boy I'll tell you what\nHe committed a felony in Nineteen Ninety One domestic violence of Nineteen Ninety four numerous parking violations another felony and two thousand for this guy was drunk court more parking violations or had a foreclosure let's see uh [noise]\nLike criminal traffic violation other traffic traffic traffic has on and on the other third degree felony and other parking violation misdemeanors recently twenty ... how's this guy not in prison he's committed multiple felonies but here's a bigger question for you\nLadies and gentlemen and this was sent to me by buddy of mine the New York\nTimes and other news outlets keep referring to this guy is a registered Republican right\nBut he's previously been convicted of selling these according to their same store and these other stores\nSo he should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote in Florida\nYou know the Democrats and the blue states in the blue cities they keep pushing for the rights of felons to vote after they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you're Gillum mentioned it and one of the debates summer even pushing for the ride of felons to vote while they're in prison\n\nBut let's talk about the facts here it's Florida\nHe should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved\nFlorida is one of the states that does not does not automatically restore the writer felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it's who might by the way it goes so left but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Barney of honor nice to do exactly that\nSo unless he had his right to vote restored he can't be a registered Republican quote unquote so I Would ask the news media out there the New York slime constipated news network MSL us day all of you\n\nHow did he become a registered Republican when I was supposed to be stripped off the off the rolls\n\nAround once again you don't automatically\nRestore the ride of Ellen's devote when they get out of prison in Florida even though the left has a ballot measure right now for this election to do exactly that so that's not job would have had as right to vote restored Yvette past\nHe's a registered Republican\nHow do they become or how did he stay a registered Republican given the multiple felonies\nHow\nIt can be restored and the lesson utterly apply to the Florida clemency board unless it was approved is that what happened are there any media outlet media outlets that want to check it out I'm curious and by the way\nI Want to thank fabulous law enforcement local state and federal fabulous law enforcement the men and women of local law enforcement the men and women of state law enforcement the\nMen and women of federal law and for it I'm not talking about like how many times you know what I mean I'm Talking about the men and women of local state federal law enforcement that my last trashes every damn day\nThat the left that taxes racist as begging every day\nAnd yet here we had Democrats targeted at local state and federal law enforcement people\nWere fabulous they moved quickly they moved effectively\nAnd they track this guy down what forty eight hours or so give or take\n\nBut don't worry and another week or two nobody trash in law enforcement like they always do like they always do\n\nAnd I wonder if this criminal justice reform stuff\n\nCriminal justice reform they called us how the hell that this guy get out of prison\nHe's got a criminal record not as long as his right arm as long as there's less than his right arm misdemeanors felonies\n\nHow did he get out and that's just the foreign criminal justice reform we spend way too much time worrying about convicted felons or people who played the felonies and not enough time worrying about victims of crimes\nWe've sped away too much time worrying about illegal aliens rather than American citizens we spend too much time worrying about illegal alien children dreamers rather than an American citizen children\n\nWe allowed to talk about these things I mean I insist on talking about these things now the president has correctly pointed out\nI Know he's an avid listener to this program and I greatly appreciate it\nThat the media really of lead the way with the rhetoric\nWas references the Hitler with the references to racism anyone they disagree with on the left and that includes a media of course that's how they frame the issues get ...\n\nAnd there'd been a number of very smart articles written today and yesterday pointing out hey look\nPolitical rhetoric even bad political rhetoric\nDoesn't justify doesn't explain what a nut job like this does and did\n\nIt simply does not I just gave you a laundry list of the crimes that he committed\n\nOften to and through twenty fourteen Donald Trump wasn't even running for president up and to and through twenty four Cheney committed multiple felonies by that multiple felonies he was already radicalized\n\nHit any Donald Trump or anybody else to push him over the edge you was already over there which\n\nHe started committing crimes at least from the public record since Nineteen Ninety One all the way through twenty fourteen\n\nSays nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing whatsoever\n\nBut the left the media the Democrats have a quote unquote registered Republican\n\nAnd Donald Trump and he's driving around with what Trump and Pence on his pictures of them and their names on his on his van\nSo they make this connection there is no connection\nThere is no connection whatsoever\nThe media trash in law enforcement the Democrats trashing law enforcement that left trashing law enforcement and now I think we can see why we need a law enforcement\n\nExcusing antifa excusing black lives matter ignoring Obama's relationship with actual domestic terrorists bill layers and burning door and among others\nPresident Trump has no relationship it never did what the actual domestic terrorists underground student terrorists who are actively involved the bombings\n\nNot Donald Trump has not partnered terrorists members of the FAA all what the Puerto Rican separate his organization you can lay that on Clinton and Obama\nTrump ever did that Trump or even suggested that Trump has been supporting the law enforcement that same law enforcement that just track down this job\n\nThat law enforcement\nBut I asked the question again maybe as a registered Republican this not job but how did he become a registered Republican how did he not lose his uh his right to vote he's not even supposed to be on the voting list or maybe a maybe there was an effort to remove them from the voting less but some left wing group said it was voter suppression\nI don't know I'd like to know\nBut you had a real mix of things here that's very fascinating to me I'll be right back [noise] money [noise]\nKnow\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners are less ... can receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to call it an air bags and their vehicles\n\nThe way he was ... or the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and pillows for the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric\nAnd whoever was doing this that was the insinuation that pushed him over the patch and that this is what causes it sort of know it doesn't but has multiple felonies in his past the guy threatened to use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty ah\nLong before Donald Trump even started with the idea of running for president United States he was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place projector discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd as pointed out in the Washington Examiner he made the bomb threat because he was angry at a party utility worker St people do not make these threats\n\nAnd commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum medical you answer Andrew Gillum\n\nWhat say well the police should pull out guns are tasers or Billy\nClubs or anything of this or no no no they should figure out how to make the guy he'll be more you know community relations my community relations\nI tell you what\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would not from a conspiracy perspective or anything else I just want to know more of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slime so washing compost the constipated news network MSL honesty and all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that and I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first report is to tell us how\nWas because Florida\nIs not allowed to clear up
