{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "It was rather um eventful uh she she is insisted that the president of the United states is dog whistling has always been dog whistling uh in order to reach his base of white nationalist when he said he's a nationalist I explained very clearly that no he was comparing nationalism to global as a\nMatter of fact I Wish I had this queued up or I Would have played this at the time but you do remember this one the president pulled out of the Paris climate accord right\nI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not parents you know what that means that's nationalism representing the people of the United states first not\nThe people of the world's first bachelor nationalism is what does that have to do with white nationalism what does it have to do with anything having to do with race but that's what the left tries to do is I Want you to ... to go back here just a little bit\nWe play a little bit of this stuff and he wrote conversation that I had already play and let the things in a shot and then what your reactions eight eight eight nine seven months age eight eight eight nine seven ... seven to for three\nGive this illicit the president's Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism not comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is\nThink about the globe burst in our country second\nA nationalist think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear that this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree given president history on racial issues getting his professional history given his father's professional history\nI prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election or he is capitalizing on ... so we're going to agree to that ...\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not cause it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many years ago then it said over the years and that's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes me feel so uncomfortable and you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you're you're you know Bloomberg TV [noise] ah editors while you're a former anyway you know ... is so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or a nationalism in globalism\nIn or you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're gonna stop other countries and taking advantage of the United states if I have to use terrorists if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better deal out of the market is that now is not economic nationalism but is that not economic\nNationalism is my question not if you look at the way the president of south ...\nChat an impact would engage in like ... to point out partner with our allies\nJak Seventy will thank you for coming on with this year she is on I live at the top of that music can\nBe on there of course was the end of the issues you at a ... interview that I did with a Seventy role this morning so that was a replay of this morning's conversation that I had there and I'm waiting for that to and [noise] um but what I Want to get to and I want you to respond to is this an eight eight eight nine seven\nOn stage um she said she's not putting words in the president's mouth\nBut she is doing exactly that she is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism the president said globalism nationalism global is put the world's first in our country second nationalist put our country first and the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she and Jim Acosta are saying\nThis rather just to follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white national I've never I mean that's if that's not putting words into somebody's mouth for the purpose of trying to tear them down\nBut nothing is he literally said why did you skip the word white don't you mean white nationalist he stuck the stuff that word in his mouth I asked up any real about it and she said no we're not putting words in his mouth that's just what he meant because he's been dog whistling and using coded language from the very beginning\nFor goodness sakes the president of the United states has set on numerous occasions I was not elected president of the world I was elected president of the United states it's my job to serve the people who elected me they are first\nI Want to give one great example that I cannot take credit for one great example I think this is just the perfect analogy alright\nOn Twitter this morning when I brought this up and I had the conversation with Stephanie rule [noise]\nSomebody tweeted to me and you can do so as well as France radio F. R. A. N. T. Z. somebody pointed to me and said you know when the airline attendant tells you to put the oxygen mask on yourself first on your children second there's a reason for that because you are no good to your child if you are passed out\nThat's nationalism\nIf we don't take care of ourselves in the United states first we are no good to anybody else around the world that is economic nationalism that is military nationalism that is taking care of yourself first and then being able to help others the president is right\nYour reaction please eight eight eight nine seven on sage coming right back by

people on hold I'll get you as quickly as I can at eight eight eight nine seven on stage that Tripoli nine seven one seven to for three but I Want to have a conversation about\nA with a good friend who has a new book out and ah who is pulling no punches he does not pull punches in his writings she does not pull punches when he writes columns for\nA town hall ... he's a senior columnist there and he does not pull punches and interviews he also does not pull punches on Twitter and he had a lot to say which made me sick coach liquor author of militant normal\nRegular Americans to\nOur democracy on the on the reality shows\nHe said let's do this thing to have you back my man how are you [noise] hey man great to be here\nBut I I mean there's so much ground to cover I Would like to do the plus injuries and everything else I wanted to talk about your book but I Want to talk about all of these issues going on Tucson diving right in\nDo you buy the right wing pipe bomb conspiracy or with all of these things being center Soros Obama's Clinton's and CNN because China weeks two weeks before the election Kurt I Do not buy it for one second I smell false flags being planted go ahead\nI think it is more likely than not a right wing conservative outlier doing this work\nIs one of three things at the right wing conservative outlier it is a nut who was a political and just wacky or it is a someone uh allied with a lap attempting to do exactly what's happening now which is a conservative suburb violent Bob guys [noise] um\nIf you look at the evidence that we are constantly told how a random shooters are going to turn out to be you know and are a Christian\nYou know what can I may never never are we know that a Democrats have been urging violence and off the grid tactics we know that the law has a history of bombings just look at the Nineteen sixties and seventies it's indisputable\nThat they did it and it's also indisputable that we didn't see a nearly endless theories about hoaxes\nMostly hate crime hoaxes on campus at an adult where someone did something horrible swastika or news or something\nAnd it turned out to be the very same a social justice for victims are trying to create a pressure\nI don't know the answer you don't know the answer but I Will tell you this I Am not going to allow the leap\nTo tell me that I Can't look at the facts and fake this a viable possibility I were to blame Donald Trump and sixty three decent Americans who are built this country feed it you'll get\nA a face on the the the\nSketchy narrative I think what we call it we'll let it\nCook for the president came out yes or to today rather and did what a president should do so did the vice president and by the way and they called for an end to this they called for civility they called for a no more violence\nHe said very clearly quote in these times we have to unify we have to come together and some one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political science up anytime I'd\nHave no place in the United states of America is\nWhat I was absolutely true that we thought of course it's true but but but hold on this is what I Want you to really react to the response to that\nFrom Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority leader Nancy Pelosi\nWas to rip President Trump suggesting that he didn't mean it saying quote from President Trump's words ring hollow until he were versus his statements that condone acts of violence they will this statement perks\nThe party that actually has Maxine Waters and Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton and countless others out they're calling for acts of violence and instability in the public forum on saying that it's Trump and the Republicans who are responsible for violence thought\nOh look they're ... they're blind and stupid because ... and got only someone wrote a book called militant normal develop on Amazon about this very subject they think we're stupid\nThey think we're stupid because Democrats are used to dealing with stupid people that is to Lincoln Democrats [noise]\nIt's not going to work this is going to have the same effect as they thought Kavanaugh was a great idea let's track that guy you know he drank beer and you know had fought in high school that's crashing and the ... that destroyed and blew away\nIs another example of a situation that the main laid it like sensible adults\nCould only benefit them politically but they ... they apply to bigotry and prejudices against normal Americans and try and paint merit as\nSome sort of a set of violence psychopaths\nAnd normal Americans are going to say and that's just not true you know whoever did this clearly need to go jail whether it's a right wing outlier a yacht or maybe you need to go to the house or a leftist trying to disrupt that [noise] um\nAnd there is not a single conservative out there who condones this violence there is not one\nWell that that's that's a big part of this because\nThe moment even when Nancy Pelosi got shouted down by a bunch of people calling her communist just a few days ago kind of echoing and Mary ... there's been done to\nTed Cruz and and and Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and just just a Sanders and so to sum it up immediately conservative condemn condemn condemn cannot you can't do that stop that nonsense we don't like it when it's done to us do not do it to them dishes bull crap we're better than that\nNow this uh these these ... you know explosive devices potentially we don't even know by the way right now what they are or or where they came from we don't immediately we condemn condemn come in and get them\nWhen the left is doing all of these things Kurt over and over and over again when these leftist mobs empty but it's so cetera et cetera are carrying out these acts I'm Still waiting for the first word of hey don't do that from anybody in a in a position of authority on the American last none\nWill you won't you won't see because they're not against it fail pouring\nThat they're there for that that's the difference in the normal people that they've got about had about ... six eight hours of this\nWhere where they could have taken the high road and maybe maybe scores of what a coincidence support all these ... or ... points but once again day of overplay their hand\nBecause they hate us normal people so much\nThey don't even bother to try and understand where we made me coming from so that they might be able to craft a message that appeals to us instead they say you know Trump's encouraging violence and they look at him and he's not encourage violent and they look at themselves and they're not racist sexes have killed and they don't like violence\nAnd they didn't like it when as normal Americans do they went overseas and defend their country\nDay are immediately and said this is more democratic alone and you know\nThey are not going to discount the possibility that some uh too clever by ...\nCrying like sending you know bombs in the early don't work very well and uh to people who ... who they know ordering a screener to catch up on that that is entirely off and knock a discount that possibility and shook it scale that possibility\nThe the the truth is what the facts are and\nYou'll have actually either this person will never be caught or the secret service and that the ... and then we will find out who this person is and yet know why\nIt teaches you can't do that because ...\nYou know secular religion\nThey can't look at themselves and say this ... is wrong means prejudices are bad we need to change the nice thing it's all based on their moral superiority and they can't question that and they won't and that's why they're going to lose two weeks from now\n... I guess the author of militants normalcy is a senior columnist on hold Tommy is also an attorney and Los Angeles California I Want to hit the nationalism part of the story is well yesterday or know choose me two nights ago in Houston, Texas\nA stumping for Ted Cruz in his race against it or ... percent of a president said\nThis show is [noise]\nCourse immediately you heard of Jim Acosta jumped up and said wait a minute yeah what what ... that's not just the cost of this is just a follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there is that what you really mean is that you're a white national\nI don't know how you get white nationalist outta asking less but I mean honestly it's like he's\nPlaying the Google auto fill he started to type in the word ... do you mean white nationalist and the left is going crazy ever since occurred making love at\nFirst of all I wanted one Democrat take sides against American to say I love America more than other countries and you're in hurry to position going into the electorate don't let me stop you right that you won't be in that fire\nAnd ask for that you're really mean white nationalist a concern about white nationalists okay that's not true there is no concern leading among when he went to pick people can come from a wire\nOkay so you were either an idiot or you or a liar or maybe both\nBut we ... if you're starting there there's no other option because it's demonstrably and one that\nYou know you have a normal Americans do I want you know I I ... I'm Eric I was in the in the air force for five years before I came home and I thought that hurts day and ... well I I I like America\nI I'm an American and they're taught me that makes me a racist I

I talked with him cause some earlier today he was one of the first people to start using this term again several years ago trying to revive it because of its actual meaning it had been given a negative connotation by some\nWho are looking at you know what are we talking about political correctness in this uh open to the to the show there and the opening of the hour you know this uh this is the following his rabid peace keeper politically correct\nIt'd be Olympic politically correct about me when I Do this thing is that my politics are correct my politics are right that's the political correctness that I'm about as far as being not offensive I don't care\nI'm not about not offending people and neither is rain 'cause San now he's a fellow at the middle east forum the gates donated Institute and the Lincoln fellow at the Claremont Institute he was a former senior advisor to brags that leader Nigel for Raj\nAnd he knows about nationalism he knows that it means taking care of yourself and your nation first not about racial politics not about identity politics it's about the nation versus global lists\nNationalism versus globalism it's exactly what President Trump was talking about it was not\nA ambiguous it was very very clear so I wanted to talk to Rahim ... about what nationalism early means since they have that experience there and as I said he's one of the first people to kind of revived the term as the president said when he said you're not supposed to say that any more and it's ridiculous to say to not be able to say I believe in my nation first\nThere's this is part of that conversation with ... ...\nThing you have to have to say I was one of the ... and but the given that nationalism goes back hundreds of years\nWhich may live in a multi ... we we reintroduce to a political lexical close The Cosby Asian I'm here in the United states\nI think that's that's a that's a great point a great distinction in and let's let's talk about that as as the president declared a correctly when he when he tried to draw the contrast between globalism thinking more about the world's a needs rather than the needs of the nation that you are elected to represent the president said that very directly\nOr that he means nationalist in that I'm going to put my people first we're worried about the concerns of less than the rest of the globe second\nUm he said that national him is kind of nationalism is kind of become a word that you don't use anymore and I think we should use it again\nWhat did he mean and why he's right of course because you saw the instant reaction why ... why do the term nationalism which when compared to globalism is a pretty benign term as far as I'm concerned that says more concerned about our people before the world's people\n\nWell he was actually a big role there generous about ... I mean if you think about what a dog um over the past Fifteen Twenty years but she hasn't really consumed itself we left with the world is concerned itself\nOlympic gold a cultural and leave your a leash or around the world whether it's in Beijing London to all you ...\nAuthor and journalist ... ... ... and trust um of the very very very few uh I'm not married or very few have been exploited workers and folks going factories\nAre exploiting jobs from Racine, Wisconsin ... says well no actually the reason you get a drunk Shay\nOut why leave it at ... ...\n... people up with all the media Iraq with special because we can go out for several years and I think people have studied it live by the way have seen over the course of his life especially when he talks about trade deals and that sort of thing that he's had these nationalistic twenty eight days but they're actually cut out and said it\nAnd he and he and he's doing by saying it\nIs is crazy gets another dividing line he's very good at doing that is\nA dividing line that he knows that the that sort of the city to the machine the Democrats the media all of those guys that they have to attack that law I have to talk about our lives and they told me it is very very hard it gets humid heat index that he will even at the age of Seventy whatever it is\nUm and they do have the lecture logging and so they call them fight the idea of nationalism and had to fight the idea that the nation states should be the final arbiter\nShady chauffeured is almost impossible especially amongst Americans I mean you'll you'll you'll ... was it national destroy Lucia\nHaven't Hamilton was on the subject matter of ... was a national issue document\nUm you know Teddy Roosevelt said about having one ... one of them one language and say goodbye to the immigrant who really to simulate each nationalism and they don't have arguments against that sort of it tired they're angry they were upset that he's a big ... rum for a man and I think that's what we've seen play out last three or four hours\nI think that's well said the only argument they do have against that is just just say just scream racism which of course there's the you know the easiest argument to make\nA ... is our guest is a fellow at the middle east for um the getting stone Institute in Lincoln fellow at the\nUh Claremont Institute you know the president said when he pulled out of the Paris climate accord he said look I care more about and I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of Paris and another event he said in his first year in the president's seat I was elected president of the United states not president of the world\nHow can any elected official whether he'd be president a member of our Congress or anywhere else suggests otherwise your job is to represent the people that chose not to represent the interests of outside nations especially\nIf it comes at the expense of those who chose to lead them\n[noise] you know that's that's a really great point and and there's actually even touch the book which just come out on this subject it's it's cool to be matched\nBy a professor older your I'm ... and he he sort of explaining this outlook and and it's it's sort of also by awful I mean the rest of the world's all you know it could be an advocate\nI and I'm ... I'm not going to have a a an empire that we once had right now you know it's sort of ... we darling historically imperialistic global aesthetically is look to one leader you know whether it's the king of England\nOr the Holy Roman empire a little little world is used to have an index story ... ... words to one person where they are and they will\nOr will several people wherever they are in the world and the world is currently doing that over his hysterically down the last few decades was the president of United States you know I always refer to build\nA road or is it in that in in that office is referred to as the world leader the most powerful man in the world you know all about sort of thing\nAnd and it's it's it's a refreshing you said you know just like for Americans were tired of you know showing trillion dollars being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan which was that it should be no money for public schools and it's right\nI think it's refreshing for them but it's also were first she shouldn't be refreshing but the rest of the world um where nations like actually a ... and stations like India stray an an a a free independent sovereign nations\nActually don't have to act as a protectorate channel\nThey actually do have to look at new sovereign nations and this was another thing the President Trump stress really talks about nature so he says look I'm not looking forward to slip protectorate started looking ... allies and and so this is a major reset what's going on now I'm ... and it pains me to say that\nWhen he talks about nationally there yeah certainly that was a period in history where nationalism\nOr ethnic nationalism specifically but very I'd be very quickly and spiraled out of control but it pains me the people don't know that nationalism actually goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and still applies to many countries most countries I Would say around the world for whatever reason\nAnd it was very why that is a great point because you ride President Kennedy who is a very different kind of Democrats and the modern day progressive Democrats but that is very very true I Wonder what they would say about that that is an expression of national nationalism unlike any other isn't it\nAsk not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country what can you do for this nation but not for the world not for the United nations\nNot for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that your responsibility because it is about us burst nation first\nNational national mean Mitt is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement up I pledge electrolytes said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever recited that pledge saying\nThis is more my allegiance laws don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico or to France or Germany or to uh to um uh Switzerland or to\nUh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a nationalist

who are involved in planning these bombs\n[noise] a need to be found as quickly as possible to get some resolution the here\nBecause the speculation is already beginning it's like after a mass shooting it just can't stop on the speculation is being promoted in the media and by politicians and that's who always promotes the speculation say deadly serious matter I underline the word deadly\nDeadly\nWe've talked about the rise in violence in this country and are concerned about it about anti offend black lives matter and about attacking public officials in restaurants\nThat we've said over and over somebody's going to get hurt now we have no idea who's behind this\nWe have no idea of the quote unquote political affiliation to the people behind it and we know all of those targeted are Democrats and CNN that we know\n\nThe white comic beyond that because we don't know anything else and yet that's what's taking place now\n\nAnd there's something really grotesque\nAbout the media in this country going on and on today about the heated rhetoric that hateful rhetoric 'cause of media in this country understand that they are leading the charge\nOn the heated and hateful rhetoric do you know yesterday alone Donald Trump I counted for four times was compared to Adolf Hitler on MSNBC and CNN six times he was called a racist\nAnd that they they want to have Donald Trump is responsible for the heated and hateful and divisive rhetoric that's going on\nDonald Trump compare somebody's Adolf Hitler\n\nAnd he's called a racist all the time so the media do not hold the high moral ground the media do not hold the high moral ground\nIn lecturing the people in the United states about the rhetoric Schumer and Pelosi put out a joint statement today they don't hold the high moral ground on this I had to get into this but it's going on all around us what am I supposed to do with north\n\nThat is a very very serious matter\n\nAnd we need to know as soon as possible who are home is responsible for this\n\nThat's what we need to know but we don't need lectures from the media as soon as this story begins to break that more and more of these packages where were uncovered\nIt was obvious read between the lines another lines are becoming more and more bold aware the media are going with this\nThey can't help themselves\nCNN received one of these packages outrageous that they received a package am I wrong Mr producer didn't somebody tried to break into the Fox local channel in Washington DC yesterday with a weapon\nAnd they were shot I mean somebody was actually shot I get death threats\nRush gets death threats Kennedy gets death threats but I Know I get death threats\nIt's not fun it's not fun\nAnd you worry about your family you're worried about you you look over your shoulder from time to time it's not 'cause you're paranoid just you had to be a little bit more careful\n\nAbout one in ... out there in antivirus filled with violence it's the most violent organization I'm aware of in politics today it was downplayed by most of the media downplayed same of black lives matter downplayed\n\nAnd I'm not saying this is exclusive to the left\n\nNot saying it's such closer to the left at all we want to know who did this as soon as possible and I believe the FBI we'll figure this out because nothing exploded so they have these ah these packages and these devices are in their original form\n\nWhich will make it much easier for them to track a download they'll get the guy or gal the guys are ...\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my past experience at the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now\nAnd they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down\n\nAnd they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then the\nTable to track people down but they need to find this person or these people because they may do it again they may do more of it\nThat's all we know we don't know their motives\nWe don't know their motives well we know the motive uh obviously it's a threatened if not harm if not killed the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why why can't people just white particularly in the media\n\nNow you can see the crescendo building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other I Am so sick of this you have no idea the president the United states without question faces death threats all the time\nIs it because what the Democrats say about him as a because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about him or she'd go bears says about him\n\nThe other day the president said or rallies in a rally I think it was used and then he says he's had nationalist well I'm not a naturalist but not for the reasons the Democrats on the left say he's a nationalist now we know what he means America First and so forth\n\nAnd they try anti attend Nazi is up\nOr the ... or the style of these this is in the media\n\nNational socialist party notice when people bring climate there socialists they don't try to tie them to the Nazis it is nationalist socialist right\nThey didn't say that about Bernie Sanders hey he's using Nazi language he's using\nStalin his language no of course not\n\nMost of the media in this country they revealed themselves except for them now the sit back for the most radical among them on cable TV on MSNBC and\nCNN for the most radical among them on the today show good morning America\nFor the most radical among them now point a finger at Trump absolutely nothing to do it this is really just further evidence of how outrageous they are\n\nThe person or people who are responsible for this are responsible for this\nAre responsible for this\nDo you think the media in this country over the last two years have been responsible do you think the media in this country over the last two years have been measured\nYou'd think the media in this country many in the media in this country cross the line with their references to Hitler Stalin and racism and all the rest of it\n\nDo you think Joe Scarborough was cross the line or make emergency or Don Lemon\nOr Chris Cuomo on the list goes on and on do you think they crossed the line with their heated rhetoric what their point something language\nAnd now\nThey're going to tell you [noise] calmed down stop the rhetoric\nThe heated attacks we must bring it down it's too much having ... the flames now they're the firefighters and same with\nPolo see the things that she is said and same with Schumer the things that he is said and the things that they did to a guy like Kavanaugh totally
