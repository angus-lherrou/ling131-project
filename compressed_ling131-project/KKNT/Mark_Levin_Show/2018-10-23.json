Stan and all the principles of lawyers [noise]\n[noise] I I Would imagine we do have the technology to do with the question is whether or not it would be effective are these people are already here uh and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do\nOr if he were to somehow try to stop remittances a and remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico\nBecause I Believe they're a second two of the largest source of income by after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nIf President Trump for example withdraws be aid from Honduras in Guatemala it'll simply make conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument of ... but Mexico is that Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally\nI'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but\nThanks for the idea of cannot look into it tai is in San Antonio Texas tired during the Larry able to show [noise]\nLove\nYour show man almost make you um so yeah that that testimony to collect gentleman a fantastic on that as a conservative or for now a long long time one of the\nThings that law understood is that the Democratic party had quite an absolute going well hold on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no clue what is going to take the but more than a month for them to get out of their own selves and so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller to ask you how many illegal\nImmigrants are accepted into this country um and I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation is so that was about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal system that we are accepting into this country and at this point in our\nHistory we have the most legal immigrants but we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven now\nIf you if you estimate on population\nYou know you and do that math that comes up almost ... percent of our population legal and mhm so you know to make the argument and this through not only democratic uh you know presidents needed for Republican and minister Asians and and this has been going on for a long long time\nUm but you know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has that when the policy for old body who entered the country illegally that's right my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd what I hear they oblige there and be willing to help you you say that there are pretty much to court in them and you know um you protect warm or whatever they're doing now is it that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally needy Italy or at least\nA medium that we can pour out of the the the integrity of Mexico's all walls themselves\nMhm [noise] well ... if they're\nEntering legal you know that's a problem so why should they why should you know if they're if they're agreeing to help us and we just went on to a new trade deal with\nThem and things like that there are mainly pressuring me people to our border and then they're going to see how we handle\nThat's exactly what's going on why do you think Trump is so upset what do you think about the so angry [noise]\nBecause the Mexican government allows the so called caravan from central and South America to come home to their country because they know they're coming up to
