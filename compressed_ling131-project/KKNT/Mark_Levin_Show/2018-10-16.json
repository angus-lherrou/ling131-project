A. G. triple eight nine to one to four three President Trump also was on sixty minutes at a number of things including that he did not make fun of Dr Christine for we're going to have that later on but first\nThe president as you know in Ohio referred to General Robert he we as a great general refer to Ulysses Grant and incredible that part was left out and NBC had an issue or a correction\nAnd Trump was not wrong about grand here as a trigger university on you look around here was Eighteen sixty\nTo America with him to death in the civil war\nLooking back it's easy to believe that a union victory was inevitable\nThe north had more money more population more industry but no one thought that at the time\nIn the first year of the war it looked as if the south when a series of high profile victories in the east convinced many that confederates were better fighters under better leaders where with President Lincoln signed a battlefield general who can do for the union what Roberts Lee was doing for the confederacy lead into victory\nThe man he found the man who save the union was delicious esque grant he wasn't Lincoln's first choice or second or third\nIn fact when the war started in Nineteen sixty one Lincoln had no idea who you listen to grant was hardly surprising since at the time grant was selling hasta farmers wives in a small town in Illinois\nHis rise to glory as one of the most amazing stories in American history born in Ohio on April twenty seventh Eighteen twenty to grant had no ambition to be a soldier\nHis father pushed him into it thinking he wasn't suited for much else\nGrants West Point career wasn't especially distinguished either but during the Mexican American War Eighteen forty six to Eighteen forty eight grant proved himself to be an officer of unusual ability he was cool under fire daring but rarely reckless even more important than men under his command trusted him\nAfter that war grant returned to St Louis to marry his fiance Julie a dent the daughter of a slave owning Missouri farmer grant was never happier than when he was with Julia and he was never been happier than when he was not unfortunately in this period army life force them to be separated sometimes for many months\nTo assuage is loneliness grant started to drink while in a distant posting in northern California a thousand miles from Julia his drink and got the better of him he resigned his army condition to avoiding embarrassing court martial\nIt was downhill from there one business venture failing after another by Eighteen sixty thoroughly humiliated and with no money and no prospects he was back working for his father in the small town of Galena, Illinois\nThen the civil war happened the union was in desperate need of experienced soldiers grant volunteered his leadership skills were immediately obvious he quickly advanced through the ranks\nIn a little more than six months he scored two major victories at Fort Henry Ford Donaldson along the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers he followed these up with victory in the largest battle in American history up to that time the battle of Shiloh making him a true union hero in a cause that was starved for heroes [noise]\nThere was nothing flashy about grants general ship all he did was when unlike the overly cautious generals that drove President Lincoln to distraction grant battle plan was to always move forward always put pressure on his foes any advantage to union had in technology or manpower he employed to the fullest\nLike Napoleon grant was a superb breeder of maps he could identify the enemies vulnerabilities and exploit them as he did in his brilliant Eighteenth sixty three campaign for Vicksburg a campaign that is still studied at war colleges\nIn March Eighteenth sixty four Lincoln made grant commander of all the union army he took more than a year of the wars hardest fighting before Li surrendered and the war finally came to an end\nBy this point the president and his general had developed a close bond shortly after grant return to Washington Lincoln invited the grants to join him and Mary Lincoln at Ford's Theatre grant excepted Julia however had developed an

comes to fighting for their political lives even within the party and goes to furlough 'em to\nSuper though not just low super low\nYou know the rally around rally around a candidate mega low [noise] um I'm In that ad you shone enjoy exponentially low\n... of the woman are complaining about American killings respond to that last hurricane you notice how shapes and see emphasize the word the sale and then she emphasized Fernandez point they're running and overtly racial or\nShe fails us which makes it covertly racial got it got\nCampaign and they're trying to undermine him but if you notice in in ... and Galen sort of songs like this is a time to come together and we're in a state of emergency we've got to rally around because people in our state hurting and in those poll numbers that you're showing that in that response from him that might seem\nTo me that might seem time the other cheek at a time when everyone's throwing hurling brick bats at each other\nI think it's resonating with people people are tired\nOf all the fighting of all the the racial horns they want someone who appeals to appeal to their better natures but who also makes it clear that they're that they're not going to back down from a challenge and they're willing to go in and do the work to help people in the tape\nBecause how many times can people go to the polls vote for someone and then nothing changes\nAnd that's been Andrew Gillum to monitor a follow along when he was nowhere in the polls and where he is four points ahead in the polls\nSo you know we've got twenty we've got twenty four Dave he's got twenty four days and I think you know the more that Republicans her all the kitchen sink at someone like Andrew Gillum and other Democrats across the country I think people are going to see what they're up to and it'll ... for them what's at stake\nSo that's Jonathan Capehart London for the Washington Post central Florida Republicans are running a quote overtly racial campaigned against Gillum here's another pundits saying that the Republicans are trying to turn the Florida governor race into a race war\nQuote it is and I think the Republican campaign the racist Republican campaign speaks to that effect at Cornell talked about [noise]\nUnless they make this from this campaign if you will on racial terms unless they turned it into a race war we've seen Andrew Gillum over and over again refuse to take the bait he's running a unifying campaign turn it into a race war and talking about what he wants to do for all of the people in the state of ...\nIn the ... more democratic candidate is refusing to take the bait Mike when his opponent around us and its use a term monkey and rather than say was just a regular expression that people you see\nOne or the other side but\nAn implied was racial me my\nOrder while the Republican Party and his Republican opponent Rhonda Santa continue to try and bring this down why\nIt's very simple explained the white electorate in Florida yeah goes eighty twenty four yeah we're on to say at this and they can make this race and find it on these discussing racial tropes that they're trying to unfortunately that will be enough to win however\nDisgusting racial tropes\nFor if they can keep those margin than we know people will call we're going to turn out much higher numbers because they're in ... excited and enthused by the given Canada said that's not going to be an issue or concern on the Democratic side\nBut I I thought there was voter suppression you here you are saying the minority vote turnout is going to be large high but I I thought they were being surprised\nBy what if the Republicans can make this a race war which is what they're trying to do and not so subtly then I think not even subtle that's their calculus for how they win this election but it's reprehensible and I think the voters of the state of Florida of\nAll colors to ask themselves are we going to fall for these cheap tactics that not only undermine our campaign system they undermine our democracy joy that's a central question people need to ask themselves going into this election [noise]\nChris Matthews just conceded\nThat most white vote for somebody if they think he's a racist why then would any politician with are cute to point to above ... life run a campaign\nThat's racist\nHere's what a pundit writing who writes for roll call said\nI don't want to go back to the women to the women's vote because I just I think it's critical that we you know we we always talk about the fact\nThat there are the gender gap in elections and that whoever is going to be elected to office typically determined by the women's vote but I have to say I I I Am very pessimistic about what we will see happen with the white women felt in terms of whether they're going to got Republican or Democrat and and I would remind the audience\nThat for it not for the vote on black women and women of color Roy and Roy worry more would have been elected in Alabama I'm despite very credible charges um that indicated that he had engaged in pedophilia\nOn that I think a racket chaser I Believe on has a new book out one

and they vote in the family that their husband to do because they always end somehow favors them and help that lead it\nAnd another one they're completely ridiculous out and saying that show because

on the air so did you all happened to catch\nThe just athletic performance Donald Trump in that sixty minutes interview uh this weekend with Lesley Stahl so I'm I'm sitting there\nAnd I'm a at the kitchen table my wife ever eating dinner and it's on and on sixty minutes once in a while not really into you know NBC nightly news or ABC News I obviously I usually just keep box on\nBut once in awhile I'll I'll turn on sixty minutes to kind of see what liberals are thinking because they they try to restrict portrayed as a straight news show yeah it's not um it's really a liberal attack dog show like everything else but once in a blue moon they all have some story that's mildly interesting so I tuned in I heard Trump is going to be on\nAnd it was a complete author or dismantling I I'm not sure sixty minutes has any idea right now [noise]\nHow bad that interview really was for them\nIt was that there was a train wreck for them I mean they just got run over by the Trump train they had no idea what was coming now the interview was conducted by Leslie stall where what was that an outlet flavors very nice personally have no idea I've never met her in my life but\nI watch some of our interviews in the past and they are always liberal\nActivists narrative interviews now rather than just going on about the Trump interview and how great it was it I Want to leave you with something\nI Want to I Want to talk to you about what Trump did why he did it how it works\nAnd how liberals are entirely not used to this in his style of dealing with the media now contrasted with Leslie stalls interview with Betsy Ross the education secretary which happened gosh I don't know um\nThree or four months ago\nAnd\nIt listed there wasn't a bad interview Betsy Voskuhl but she got caught it on a couple of questions and Leslie stall was trying to advance a narrative Leslie stall when she got into things like school choice in other questions like that [noise] um she was trying to advance a narrative a liberal now does she really wasn't looking for answers that's what liberals do you know when\nWhen I ran for office I saw this political reporters which is Ninety nine percent of them\nThey don't ask a question to get an answer\nThey ask you a question to develop and advance a pre existing storyline\nOn any question it doesn't matter folks throw it out there on taxes the preexisting storyline is um ... tax hikes are going to bankrupt the government and that they're always in it for the rich the Republicans ... ... they're not asking you a question about tax cuts\nThey're just asking a question to advance the narrative that you're on the side of the rich guys screwing over the average American\nOn health care it's there you're looking at throw grandma off the cliff you're cool you want people to die\nOn schools is that you're starving public schools uh money despite the fact that part of a good public schools have records of matter of fact it doesn't matter they're not really asking questions what they're trying to do is get a narrative advance and they're trying to do what's called framing they're trying to frame the question in a very specific way\nAnd they are used to doing this and winning because what happens they ask the questions the Republicans panic\nYou know listen there's this tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well under these types of of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in taxes of course they're gonna do well in through a tax cuts that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they haven't they haw and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner what Trump did in that interview\nWas just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely there is a PHD costs and how to handle the liberal media he does not accept the premise of the question in terms of the question to an answer he wants to answer\nNot an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by about pre existing narrative and try to advance it she re frames it in his way [noise]\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC when Trump such talking about how bad the media is\nThis just say hey this is Trump's narrative it's an out of the true by the way that the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost total logical Trump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we reframe said life we saw who's smart\nShe's ... she's not them she's very bright and she's just a liberal Jewish too liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop them she cuts them off by the way she interviewed um I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right [noise]\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the away basketball court here\nShe knows it she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars and all\nThat's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\n\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about it or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance Trump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paint this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\n\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let lives we saw that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last word and he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is a simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in is Utah class then that's what everybody remembers solve\nTries to stop 'em on when he goes on this or when he goes on attack with the media right\nAnd he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know ... and then that's why I'm president and you are not and that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what\nThink this is the tough time the media is having with the sky they don't understand that it's the sense of again a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversation sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys\nThere are the natural vicissitudes or the competence of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard\nThat people are attracted to that authenticity\n\nSo we understand the as to reframe it number one and secondly\nHe understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody\nRemembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance\nAt the point out what he did\nBut the show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a just a litany of fraud in and out of the ... were completely\nInauthentic who they're ... they based their entire campaigns around identity politics and class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren that I\n... I mean holy what other presidents other than Donald Trump never forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement could have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren is going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American\nElse could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nBefore the show stuff yourself these people are everywhere stepped down the radical left the closer everywhere but Maxine Waters stuff the Cory bookers up get up in a very straight up in the face why are we getting up in America you know fellow American citizens faces cameras just have a conversation why is that necessary\n\nI have never had the desire and I'm sure knowing march audience for many of you have an either ... you know when I travel a lot I see strangers in the airport sometimes are liberals and a couple of 'em have said nasty things so I think I Would never have you ever\nLife had the desire to walk up to a total stranger who had like an Obama ad on and like I Would I get up in his face and why\nWould you do that you want to talk about politics fine I get up in there for when you're talking about there is no middle ground we\nHave to win that's why I keep saying the new rules are in effect in Trump gets it they have to lose and we have to when we need to exercise raw political power to keep these people on the radical left for taking power because they've shown no evidence do handle it responsibly\nVocal anywhere because later in the show me to talk about new developments on the the Spygate thing that broke this weekend representative John Ratcliffe gave a explosive interview on Maria bought a robo up about ... exculpatory evidence that's probably hanging out there\n\nBut folks they're not even authentic Bernie Sanders on the economic front Elizabeth Warren with the with the continued insistence that she's a Native American you know a bagel with this constant like I have a skateboard guy look at me look out coal am I skateboard in the water burger parking like great good well\nWhy does that matter he's skateboard who cares you ever seriously\nVoting for this guy or considering voting for this
