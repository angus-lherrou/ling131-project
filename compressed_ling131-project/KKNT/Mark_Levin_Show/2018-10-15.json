professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes you with us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system well the very drugs that are training the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the mission and many of them is also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's something it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to

better it helps control the stress of the work in the world and many people will just be amazed how this actually work\nBecause our formula has a chemical reaction occurred before you actually ingested mhm Mac its previous off it doesn't get lodged in your system\nAnd so what happens is that when people drink the ... it's like an infusion into your body is like like compress it and so people who are in pain they take the comments the calcium and he didn't get into the mud and it starts to relax it\nDr fingers you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you

with any medication okay it's a hundred percent natural state and you know formula doesn't contain sugar which isn't\nA lot of Calvin product wheat gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to

calcium and magnesium\nDr Pincus unfortunately we're about out of time or any any parting thoughts I mean who who can really benefit from this\n[laughter] I Wish we had more time because this this

citizen or for someone who can't sleep well where you're experienced a lot of muscle cramps a lot of ... and your body [noise] this is an absolute it's so simple but it controls most every function and your whole body you're someone\nSo we began with a new Supreme Court justice justice Brett Kavanaugh well on the surface highly partisan messes mind is the ramifications will likely continue into the mid term elections in November\nPoll showed American voters did not like the way Democrats in the Senate handled the serious matter\nThey took the goodwill of the me too movement weaponized said

restaurants do to their home is that going too far [noise]\nI think that it will than there are a lot of people who are very very much ah I'm motivated but what is going on because I'm like okay with\nOn a narrow Gulf Coast peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and to the south of black bay\nA Biloxi to the north All right so the city is named for the Biloxi a Native American people who wants to inhabit the area\nThe name is thought to mean first people\nAlexi is subject to periodic devastating hurricane including\nHurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine quite a while ago\nAnd even the more destructive Hurricane Katrina and two thousand and five but I Will say this um I was there shortly after Hurricane Katrina\nAnd it was beautiful and I'm just going to say this what an amazing value of a place to go as well\nSo the history of Black Sea is you know really cool so during the course of electric biloxi's history eight flags have flown over her and the Mississippi Gulf Coast these flags include the flags of six countries\nFrance England Spain and the republic of West Florida Confederate States of America and the United states stars and bars\nAre the other two flags for state flags magnolia state flag and the current Mississippi State flag Biloxi was inhabited by Native Americans as early as eight thousand D.C up to the Seventeen hundreds and artifacts from the tour and sorry from the four major periods of\nNative American history even found on biloxi's peninsula\nBy the turn of the century Biloxi had become the seafood capital of the world\nAnd it's one of the reasons I like it so much in the Nineteen twenties that were more than forty seafood factories occupying the two cannery districts\nSome of the first fisherman were Australian I'm Sorry Austrians from the Dalmatian coast in Eighteen Ninety the bohemian became the first imported imported laborers from Baltimore in in in Nineteen fourteen the Cajun families arrive from Louisiana All right\nSo in Nineteen oh eight the first Mardi Gras parades took place in Biloxi and in Nineteen twenty seven the seawall with ... constructed to protect Mississippi Gulf Coast\nAnd in Nineteen twenty nine the first blessing of the shrimp fleet took place in the city between Nineteen thirty four and Nineteen forty seven eight Gulf Coast air\nStation was located on biloxi's point cadet in Nineteen forty one Biloxi was the site for the army air corps technical training base known as Kessler field today catch their field air force base is the location for many technical school unemployed many local people\nNow I just want to take five minutes and say if you go to my Facebook site due to the fact that Biloxi is the seafood capital I'm going to include a recipe this week for Krabbe ball\nThat is one of my favorite favorite entertaining appetizers and super cheap and easy so just be aware that will be on Victoria ... Facebook site and it is again a\nLittle tribute to the Biloxi area as being the seafood capital and again\nA way that we hear in landlocked Arizona can create a fresh seafood seafood appetizer from a a real tiny little can uh can grab and you will look like the gourmet of the year so now we're going to finish talking about\nFor Massachusetts okay so consider it visit to this place it's located on west ship island\nFor Massachusetts is one of the last masonry coastal fortifications built in the United states and its construction began before the civil war and fell victim to advancing military technology however its beauty and craftsmanship remain [noise]\nOkay for those of the military guys and chanting Seventy ... minute ferry ride transport visitors to west ship island where park rangers provide A Guided tour of this cool for Massachusetts All right so\nAfter Fort Massachusetts be sure to stop it be or bar the retirement a state\nOf the Confederate president Jefferson Davis\nIt's an exceptional example of Victorian home at the Victorian homes that once graced the coast and this is something if you haven't been to the Gulf Coast\nVictorian homes or something to see All right so this one is complete completed an Eighteen fifty two and it stands on a spectacular fifty one acre site\nOverlooking the Gulf of Mexico both a Mississippi historical landmark and a national historic landmark turning this home in the must now for\nThe view that like a little bit of gambling beginning in the Nineteen nineties casino\nBecame one of biloxi's chief economic activities with several casinos located in the city government services and seafood processing are also important like we mentioned don't forget to look up that crap all annual festival include the blessing of the shrimp fleet and Mardi Gras Biloxi spirits\nNow the Gulf Coast\nArt and historic attractions are on the Mississippi Gulf Coast you can take a stroll through town and turn in it'll turn into a full fledged art walk\nYou may stumble upon the famous arts artist gallery or come across a hand gun mosaic on a stone wall by the shoreline art is everywhere on the coast and it comes and plenty of forums if you're more of a history buff check out the maritime\nAnd seafood history industry museum it was established in Nineteen eighty six to preserve and interpret the maritime history and heritage of the Mississippi Gulf Coast the museum accomplishes this mission through in a way of exhibits\nAll right so artifacts and extraordinary collection of photographs which tells the story from the time of the first Indian settlement through generations of integrate immigrants whose journey contributed to the melting pot culture of the Gulf Coast\nGotta love Mississippi guys so Lynn meadows discovery center is a children's museum but actually also\nA place where children and adults with every age can imagine create and have fun just off the beach in Gulf port so that's a little bit of a drive you know if you're going to get a little bit of a truck from Biloxi but it is cool it's in a colorful school building wind the cooling welcoming awaiting children to\nCome and play and it is this at the center of the facility is the super colossal climbing structure and acts as an access for the other exhibits and lets children reach for the stars at the bottom floor is the ... by a special place just for them\nHop aboard a train at doling avenue depot put and put their imaginations to work at the port and stopped by the arts studio to make a creative ... keep say okay so\nI Want to just say there is nothing better than a day at the beach who doesn't love that a bad day at the beach is better than the best day you've ever had at work okay so\nAnd the Mississippi Gulf Coast is just the place to kick off your shoes put your feet in the sand and relax they have sixty two miles of scenic shoreline and it's easy to find a perfect place to set up for a day in the sun hop on a ship\nAnd head to ship island for an excursion from Gulfport to the small craft harbor to west ship island and part of the Gulf Islands national seashore there's twelve miles offshore from Gulfport the island offers its it's gorgeous\nWith the Gulf Coast waters for swimming sunbathing and shelling and more\nIn fact a chain of Gulf Coast islands includes east and west ship island and it limits the amount of strong weights reaching the mainland beaches creating calm and gentle waters across the coast so let me just say\nI have to tell you I went when my personal experience so just take a moment here and and imagine\nYou're with your children you really don't have to worry about them being swept away by waves because of this whole thing with these two islands I was there and my child at the time was about a year old and everybody was\nWas getting cried dads and things you just wait out to need knee deep without even thinking about it because the kids there is nothing is going to happen to them\nThey're going to go it's ... it's like lake water guys so it's really beautiful and they have these old old um what are they called the piers\nThan they are kind of gone but they still have the pillars from those old peers and that's also a beautiful place for family pictures I found and so just take a minute and enjoy those beaches because it's gorgeous and white sands as well\nSo I Would say you know you also don't want to miss the breweries the ... you'll find plenty of breweries along the Gulf Coast in a popular one is Biloxi Brewing Company it's a local craft\nBrewery with no reservations required tours and pacing offered for those above Twenty one years on Saturdays from noon to six PM hey hey\nOkay so Chandler Brewing Company in Gulfport is also really cool they use only malted barley hops and local ingredients and its dog friendly guys so you know you can do your dog walking\nAnd go there and the ... Chandler islands off the coast of Mississippi are also it's really what it's named after and so it is really really cool uninhabited island chain and approximately fifty miles long\nIn a nutshell actually I'm All right so first remove at walnut from its shell identify areas of your wouldn't furniture that are unsightly because they have been bumped are scraped\nIf you have children good luck to not having pristine furniture and so you need to then take this walnut and rub it up and down along the scratch\nDo this in a circular motion across the length of the scratch from one end to the other\nNext warm the gash those but that's what I said to my children do you gashed my furniture with your finger to penetrate the nuts oils and allow them to soak in for five minutes\n[noise] All

one percent on a middle class budget guys beaches beauty family time this is all super important and today we're talking about\nMy vacation from my vacation vault the Biloxi area of the Gulf Coast in Mississippi beautiful underestimated wonderful trip exceptionally inexpensive as well so one thing I wanted a couple of things I wanted to mention before I Move on to a couple of other things\nAbout you know living well on Biloxi the lighthouse it's something that you should know about it is a city institution and a symbol of resolving strength in the face of the challenges that have seen over time including most recently Hurricane Katrina\nThe lighthouse was built if cast iron in Eighteen forty eight ...\nOne of the first of its kind in the Americans out and vote the Biloxi lighthouse was a private entity from Eighteen forty eight Nineteen thirty nine\nIt was famous for having been operated by several different female lighthouse keepers super cool ladies All right I'm a huge fan of ... just decide moment here I'm a huge fan of Pete's Dragon and within singing candle on the water I Can't do that on key but you know\nI just love this thing it is so it's it's ... you go back to your childhood being ten years old All right so\nThe thing is it is it it was taken\nOver by the coast guard um shortly after Nineteen thirty nine and\nIt has it been transferred to the city of ... Hurricane Katrina did significant damage to the White House as the waves it caused battered a full\nThird of the structure but the lighthouse was restored and re open to the public in two thousand and ten so you shouldn't miss it if you go there now I'm another thing that is in Biloxi that is really really cool is the boat revised by Mariette now if you're going to go there it's a prime destination for visitors\nResearchers from the University of Florida cautioned against using the mixture on children under three years of age probably due to that which hazel some lavender love the smell\nNow if you just wanna use lavender by itself you can crush lavender flowers produce a fragrance and oil that can ... ... s repel mosquitoes the lavender has a um anti fungal antiseptic quality that means\nIn addition to preventing ... it can calm and sued the skin as well so you can grow lavender and an outdoor garden or in planters many ... we have lavender here in Arizona crush the flowers and apply the oil to bite sensitive areas of the body\nSuch as your ankles or arms I my ankles looked like can't go sometimes after I'd been in the area\nIn the deep south with no mosquito repellent on there you gotta you gotta really watch it are you going to\nHave a problem you know one size fits the ankles alright so\nAlso drop some lavender oil on clean cloth and rub it onto the skin cinnamon oil is kind of an unknown thing it's more than ... than just a great topic to apple sauce or oatmeal\nAccording to a study conducted in Taiwan send them an oil can kill off mosquito eggs it can also act as a repellent against adult mosquitoes most notably the Asian Tiger mosquito\nI don't really want to know all the different species of mosquitoes I don't know about you guys but if there's an agent if you're in Asia you get that seminal oil on their okay so\nI'm also to make a diluted one percent solution makes one fourth teaspoon or twenty four drops of oil for every four ounces of water you can spray the fluid under your skin or clothing around your home\nOnto your culture plant be careful when applying cinnamon oil as a concentrated does can irritate your skin but you know thinking about it here even here in Arizona in the summer I Will hear mosquitoes in my house in my ears while I'm sleeping so\nI'm going to probably put that around my pillow spray it on my pillow\nUm you know this isn't just for the south folks this is also here in Arizona we get them it's a little more moist here than in in more recent years so treating mosquito bites even with mosquito repellent you may get itchy painful mosquito bites so to treat mosquito bites at home you can try rubbing apple cider vinegar\nAt the site of the bite putting a slice of raw onion or freshly cut garlic on the bike can also provide pain relief or you know each relief\nAnd guard against infection calamine lotion or over the counter hydro cornerstone cream can also help as well if you develop an infection or allergic reaction due to a significant amount of mosquito bites\nTake note of your symptoms and contact your doctor and elevated temperature posts are bleeding where the bite or scabs with a ... or scab that won't go away can be a sign of a problem now\nSome of the mosquitoes I guess there's several different kinds I Will get well so for those of you to have that you know some of these kids can be really really helpful um especially if you're going on hikes and you're out in nature connecting if you're hearing right next to that can be a little distracting for years than moment out in nature\nUm so you know some of this can be really really helpful without covering yourself in dangerous deet\nAll right so now we are going to talk about jogging and you know\nWe might even be naming this jogging across America I Love that idea [laughter]\nAll right John [laughter]\nDoesn't love jogging I mean for goodness sake even Forrest Gump ran across America All right so whether I'm On the road or travelling or at home I enjoy jogging to keep in shape there are many places you can go jogging in Biloxi\nMississippi but like anywhere I go I always feel safer if I had at least one of the safety devices on the market with me just in case I'm attacked or if someone approaches me that makes me feel uncomfortable\nIn previous shows I've talked about nice pepper spray and devices such as nickel lights and the tiger lady when my favorites\nI recently came across another cool safety device called the go guarded rain it's designed for women this product which created with the belief that you instinctively use your hands to protect you should you ever be attacked\nAnd with this ring on you'll definitely feel much safer\nThe doe guarded ring was invented by a female runner who found herself vulnerable and defenseless on run even with a background in criminal justice and law enforcement\nSo this rain can be worn on eight any finger and feature a heavy duty it's gotta separated with an edge love that it looks cool\nAnd unlike some products you don't have to retrieve it from a pocket running belt or a fanny pack it you can use it right away it's ready to go it's harder to knock out of your hand as well the rain comes in women sizes seven to nine and a half\nAnd colors are blue and pink\nNot it's All right so from rings ten necklaces the guardian whistle necklace is somewhat stylish stainless steel necklace that can be worn to work daily or just about any occasion what's great about this necklace is the whistle features and that ensure a runner can be heard from anywhere along the route\nSo I Do go running sometimes after work in in that neighborhood and it is helpful to have\n'em so also you should ask a local ... where you're looking for a place to jog or a good restaurant coffee shop or anything else you know asking a local it's\nReally the best resource lifetimes locals don't leave reviews on places because they are local they already know what what's what especially in some of these smaller places so someone who knows the city inside an out is guaranteed to have an invaluable amount of information\nAnd so maybe it's hip jazz bar hidden behind the light the storefront\nAnd or down an elevator the best outlook point to watch the sunset over the rooftops\nIn my case you know a couple of weeks ago I was you know in ... new Smyrna and the tree house was fantastic but um you know\nI Will just at that was like a you know a local favorite there and and so here's the thing you know there's a hole in while restaurants there's little tiny places that you just don't want to miss out on so by asking a local you get all the inside tips\nSo by all means have some can't miss activities planned we arrived but if you adapt the attitude of we are here what's the rush you'll find yourself experiencing things beyond your dreams give yourself a day to throw that itinerary out the window leave your phone in the room and just live\nIt may sound terrifying but when you let yourself be in the moment you'll see how natural it can be to strike up a conversation with someone who calls your vacation destination home when you do\nHere's what to ask\nNumber one start asking for their recommendations for you know what you're looking for you want to know their idea of a good time not something they think you would want to do you can spend this question to fit the kind of activities you're looking for of course showing interest in the individual makes them interested in you know\nSo I ask how safe the area is at night if you're looking to check out the local nightlife or even just taking the moon walk and people watch you want to make sure you you're safe in the neighborhood\nThings are inherently more dangerous after dark asked about safety so you can find out\nAbout tax the options and what areas to avoid um or any any experiences that have taken place that you know at their recent you don't want to paint your trip with something that happens to you and so really just need to asked\nAround and and be safe so asking a local if they know of any local artists or jewelers\nI'm so when it comes to souvenirs forget the fridge magnets and T shirts find out if there is an up and coming pain or you can help support or someone who beat necklaces by hand\nThese gifts will give your friends are yourself a real piece of the culture you know when you go back home\nSo a hand crafted bowl you know I'm you know those kinds of things like several years ago when I went to Cleveland have been several times for different work trips they actually have a cafe over by Case Western I\nMentioned in a different show but the the gentleman who owns the cafe this is a perfect example you know he he's a ... he's a carpenter but he's really a wood worker and does these would cutting boards and would\nYou know counter tops I was able to get myself a a wood cutting board um if you go on to my Facebook site I Believe it was an it's an older show\nBut you know that's an example of something unique that is someone special talent that you know you wouldn't normally see and uh it's not something you want to just like go to a catchy kind of gift shop and get something you know somebody really put some time and effort into something cool\nSo All right um you know and that's a really nice reminder of your experience with that trip so now let's talk about ... ... well on trips to take before you die [laughter]\nSo I kind of look at this a little bit differently you know I I Do travel with my parents and children as well and for many of
