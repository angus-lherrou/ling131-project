registration fees\nIn order to pay for infrastructure and [noise] all that's coming up from late nights have been one S. A. G. and Kanye West went on\nSaturday Night live and when the show was over before the studio audience went on a rant about the welfare state house destabilized families and Ninety percent of the media is left wing [noise]\nI thought it was at a seat pac convention [noise] all that and more\nNow but for the for Kavanaugh hearings where Ford made her accusations and Kevin are responded sixty nine percent of Republicans supported Kavanaugh's nomination to the court thirty two percent of the general public supported it\nNow\n\nWhen Ford testify but before Kevin responded listen to this panel headed up by Clinton apple is\nNo people are watching this all across the country has its began I got a text for fencing she looks like every woman you know she and dean does uh she is someone that\nIs keep in mind this pan always before Kevin testified but after four did\nCompletely recognizable to everybody in the country [laughter] I'll leave we know women just like her and uh and she's certainly doesn't seem to the somebody with an agenda as she is putting herself in this very difficult position\nIt says very I'm hearing and the difference between the Democrats and Republicans has been very striking that her son that I think has come off and so far it highly credible\nI've examined hundreds of witnesses on the witness than she is extremely credible she's extremely detail oriented they're a little things about what she has said\nLike the fact that she has two front doors you can't make that stuff up it is so unusual that sort of detail it makes her testimony extremely credible and also that she said I Am terrified to be here I don't want to be here but I feel that this is my civic\nDuty I found her to be one of the most credible witness and I think I've seen\nIt in Georgia have to say it is unmistakable\nHere how how clunky it is the transition between the Republicans on this committee to the Democrats you talked about Rachel Mitchell there who's been brought in by the Republican so that they would not have to question Dr Christine Blasey Ford or up right capital when he appears to be for\nUs here later today with that transition back and forth has been [noise] um\nIf you will of what has\nNot been bumpy sort of the temperature\nIn tone in that room from the woman who was answering the questions Dr Christine Blasey Ford obviously up to the American people at home to make up their own minds about the veracity of what she's saying\nWhat she has been very consistent or\nAgain that's an ABC panel led by George Clinton awfulness after Dr ... four testified but before Brett Kavanaugh did meanwhile on CNN Simone Sanders said this about Kevin\nI don't believe that cat and I'll tell you the entire kids on the part that he noted about that you are about ... but we call the young woman that when that ... because she was one of them but she didn't know about it I just thought it wasn't believable I think he he he told not to buy you write about that\nSo I don't think he needed to lie about that perhaps he thought that that he could not get any ground um because he didn't want to be found ... off anything the most striking thing for me what the thing that\nI understand if you had been do you believe you have not done something wrong and us fat and you angry but the way he portrayed himself at the or outside of the hearing today um he looked on hand just\nUnhinged\nSo based upon that reaction based upon the reaction by ABC panel one would think that even Republicans might have gotten a wobbly on Brett Kavanaugh who contrary mon for I mentioned that before the Ford Kevin ... sixty nine percent of Republicans supported his nomination to the Supreme Court\nAfter the for Kavanaugh hearing the figure roast and Seventy five percent meanwhile forty six percent of Republicans said they would be angry as opposed to be disappointed\nIf Kavanaugh is rejected\nNow as far as the public at large is concern before the Ford Kavanaugh hearings as I mentioned thirty two percent of voters favorite Kavanaugh's nomination\nNow thirty seven thirty seven percent favorite now in thirty percent opposed it now thirty seven percent of post\nSo it's appeared to shower the general public on Kavanaugh but not on Republican ProPublica's if anything the again Lindsey Graham has warned that this was the new norm watch out for your nominees guys\nThe polygraph and they didn't tell us until September twenty six\nAnd deal with this what's in front of a guy who adamantly denies is everybody who actually knows him in a real way say this is not the guy I Know I got Dr Ford and can't tell me the time in the place and we'll see\nWhat happens to be something to do that and now I'm going to go to our uh I don't know for some Republicans not as I said my Republican colleagues have this becomes a new standard\nFor you have an accusation for weeks\nAnd drop it right before the hearing you withhold from the committee a chance\nTo do this and they have professional timely fashion me one day publically say\nTheir goal is to delay the get the Senate back in twenty eight teams to make sure he can't fill the seat they're probably saying that I don't want to reward that kind of behavior I think we've been very fair and to my Republican colleagues if you can ignore everything in this record looking at allegation is\nThirty five years old is uncertain time place Dayton and no cooperation if that's enough for you [noise] God help us all as Republicans this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends\nThis is the new norm you better watch out for your nominees thing why\nSenator Ronald said women should not only to listen to they should be believed to she told me to shut up and\nDo the right thing for a change to that Lindsey Graham said this survey regret\nThank you I Know I'm a single white male from South Carolina and I told I should shut up but I Will not shut up if that's okay because I got here the same way everybody else did\nThe people in South Carolina voted for me and centers got to be their voice men and women\nAnd I'm not trying to be their voice today\nAnd uh maybe not just from South Carolina but a little bit about what I think is going on here\n[noise]\nJoy ... her over at the view in mid season form\nDo not want to investigate this any further [noise] they just want to hold onto them how they know that this country is getting darker why here are pans\nOn now sixty one percent of compromise that are coming out I mean there's been a white Caucasian race card can\nClaim forty five can hold the forty nine percent towards going down and they worry that white people are gonna lose all their\nPower to them they don't care and she's line well shit hotline he's like they just want to hold onto power outage sound will be like South Africa apartheid lieutenant fat white people were running the country [noise]\nWhat\nHe's like they just want to hold onto that how how does sound will be like South Africa apartheid with fat white people were running the country it seems like that for trying to re that were on me the trajectory well I'm not going all over again\nDid we not just elected and re elect a black man for president\n\nMy must Thirteen in California recruiting their children and uh it's going to be repealed or when I'm the governor but\nRight now and I met the young uh Huntington Beach a a city attorney who mounted this lawsuit and very gratified that the court held that charter city don't have to comply with the uh sex or a state law and let me tell you it's going to be a non issue after I'm the governor because we're going to get get rid of it\nJohn Cox before this happened I didn't know the difference between a general city general lost city in a charter school he turns out that the largest cities in the in the state\nUh San Francisco or LA San Diego Fresno\nThese are all so called charter cities will give them a lot more control over things like I'm a police authority and therefore they can uh cooperate with a with the federal immigration authorities they can if they want to uh during routine traffic stops inquired about the immigration status of people [noise]\nUh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you are charters city and there are about a hundred and twenty starter cities in the state coming\nAbout two thirds of the population you have all these rights but you don't have as a general law city\nAnd uh but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for San Francisco to do anything about this uh I mean the you know there there are in the process of trying to get the state to approve a legal injection sites where addicts and shoot up in a nice clean environment\nWhich I think is it's certainly are ridiculous and it's not going to solve the problem the horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California\nJohn Cox when are you going to debate your opponent\nNext Monday at ten am on a public radio station he doesn't want to face me across a table on live television Larry I mean he's afraid that my good luck so just an overwhelming as a [laughter] but really it's\nReally actually I look like such a youngster next to me a a which is good and I promise not to use his youth and inexperience against\nThem [laughter] John Cox speaking of of good looks he he is a a good looking guy a guy and and I'm thinking maybe that's why you been able to get away with some of the stuff you've gotten away with this is the guy who had an affair with his best friend who was his campaign manager the wife of his best friend who was a campaign manager who does that and it can still survive\nA I don't know that's the broke called the ... a a let's say

to keep them as a union\nMembers in a you know we need to make sure we teach our kids are in and get out from under a forty seventh and the nation we need to have our schools be number one in the nation and that would be the case when I'm a governor\nJohn Cox for governor dot com is John ... for governor dot com John only a few seconds left where does your opponents than on the bullet train

relief factor dot com studios if let's say an Larry\nElder Hi Larry my name's later I had I'm all for the president and the you know where you are I'm Brett Kavanaugh however we haven't heard anything about them expanding the interview on Mrs Ford if they're going to look hard into one I think they should look into the other give me your opinion thanks very much\nI couldn't agree more and earlier we are talking about the yearbook citizens from eighty to eighty four years before your book on the principle that she\nWent to I actually agree with your book described a Animal House our environment [noise] that I think needs to be boring drinking [noise]\nAnd drinking and drinking and drinking triple\nA nine to one as a GE triple a nine to him and wanted them to for three Larry Elder release acting dot com studio and we expect it to fight over judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court will be over by this time next week Mitch McConnell says he wants to vote next week\nBut the battle against those who would restrict your religious freedom goes on twenty four seven and nobody but nobody even the front lines more than my friends and alliance defending freedom from the courthouse all the way to the Supreme Court ATF fight the good fight as eighty of senior counsel David Cortland tells us\nIts growth has been fantastic its effect on the culture has been fantastic and again as you mentioned um idiots win rate is unmatched unparalleled it's the Supreme Court player or were successful there nine victories over the last eight or nine years um and God is good um our our team is fantastic out as good\nCalled us MCA sort of just war and [noise]\nSo we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and drag because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations all over the world that we're changing that by the way without tariffs we wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs that influenced Congress oh please don't charge tariffs\nWithout tariffs he wouldn't be we wouldn't be standing here I can tell you Bob and all of these laws would not be standing here right now and we're totally prepared to do that if they don't negotiate\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreements in the history of our country would the most advanced protections for workers\nEver develop\nNow the caller asked me if I'm prepared to apologize of course not let me tell you something\nInitially President Trump talked about terrorists in order for uh for national security remember that never mind that we produce most of our studio here and the two other major suppliers Canada and Mexico are friendly countries so the national security stuff with BS and you know if he stopped saying that\nNow if the goal is to reduce tariffs with our trading partners I'm all for in the short run doing something to make them stand out the question is is this going to benefit the American consumer and extra early to tell that\nThe New York times called it a victory for the president and it is the shield it as well and it is because the campaign to reevaluate their to renegotiate NAFTA the question is is it going to be positive for the American consumers for example [noise]\nNew York times points out that for the first time the new agreement mandates that an increasing percentage of parts for any tariff free vehicle must come from so called high wage factory\nThe agreement says they'll sacrifice pay a minimum sixteen dollars an hour in average salaries for production workers that's about cripple the average wage in Mexico right now and the assumption is that division will force automakers to strip suppliers from Mexico or Canada to this country [noise]\nBut there is to that automotive Alice had warned that the provision could have a damaging effects were Americans quote by raising costs for American car buyers and incentivizing automakers to move production to low cost countries outside of the country like China\nSo we really don't know yet and I want to find out more about it before I determine whether or not the president has done the right thing with NAFTA and know what's popular among the base especially and now they have to Bernie Sanders has become a anti free trade and um the Republican Party also anti free trade\nAre both parties now have pretty much the same position on trade\nOne more time this was about consumers and tariffs\nIf they're designed to protect industries that are there are failing all they do is prevent the business people from doing the kinds of things that need to do in order to make those businesses competitive and if the idea is to retaliate against or the or the country for so called dumping products on us dumping simply means that other companies are are being subsidized by their government\nThey're not making money but they are being subsidized by government and and if that stupid why should we would retaliate by doing something equally stupid I still feel exactly the same if however the\nGambling is to cause our trading partners to reduce their terrorists in our goods\nOpening up their markets for manufacturers and suppliers that's good\nBut it for free silt and higher prices to the American consumer explained to me how that's a good idea\nSo it's too early to a a do a victory lap as far as I'm concerned I Want to find out more about it anyway thank you very much for uh for the call appreciate it AAA mindset and one S. A. G. E. is a number let's go back to leap forward to having a matter met in ...

than repetition you understand the media are exploiting you're right\n\nThey keep using breaking news headline news breaking news that there is nothing breaking and there's nothing headline\nNothing else has happened\nSo what I Do on this show\nAnd what I have done on the Fox show what I Do on the TV and I really enjoy living TV I Hope you do to what I Do is something a little different I treat you with respect I treated like yeah I'm In college is not this constant dumbing down with big mouse\nThis Rachel Mitchell she was ... ... per\nI think a lot of people were jealous or these judges each guys who uh judges say where the lowest judges in one state or another try all of a sudden their constitutional experts they're experts at all say they're experts on nothing nothing\n\nShe broke

years\nGuy was on the star prosecution team for four years I was at the white I never said a word not not anybody\n\nThen he's nominated to the United States Supreme court of a sudden here's my civic

duty on July sex what happened to her civic duty on July\n\nOh yes I'm allowed to ask these questions\nI'm a\nWhat do you think mark nothing happened you know I Believe something did happen but I think she's wrong about who the perpetrator was and I think at this point you probably knows it which is why she doesn't know who drove her home she there's so many gaps\n\nYou understand if you don't have witnesses or collaboration or evidence you can't even get into a courtroom you understand that right\n\nSo now notice how it's changed over the weekend if Kavanaugh lied about his drinking what about a lot about his drinking\nLied about his drinking a lot about drinking Mr President\n\nThey're worried about drinking on Capitol Hill is a bunch of slush slash isn't drunks and all kinds of things on Capitol Hill but isn't that an interesting stand it if you lied about his drinking when he was in high school or college\nThat's it\nThese politicians on Capitol Hill they lie all the time that lie about getting rid of Obamacare they lie about securing the border they lie about it\n\nBut it's okay because that's part of their quote unquote procession\n\nGot to thinking to myself who was one of the biggest drinkers\nWinston Churchill\nBig smoker and drinker Winston Churchill\n\nThese men so midgets who call themselves Democrats in Congress couldn't hold a candle to Winston Churchill and they can't hold a candle that Brett Kavanaugh and\nI'm Still not a hundred percent sure he's a Scalia typewriter Thomas high but I Know he's not a real spider Ginsburg type and right now that's fine by me\nBecause this like the battle over the election to protect the parents in front of a cool it's the same damn battle it's the same damn thing\n\nLook how half your country wants to throw due process out the window look half your country wants to throw the presumption of innocence out your window look out\nCountry wants to use a high school as a basis for destroying them and we are not required to follow the insane off the edge of the ladies and gentlemen\n\nNow when we return let's look at again\nSome of the details that demonstrate that Dr Ford is not\nCredible as applies to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I keep hearing also that the Democrats have done her no favors ladies and gentlemen that they have exploited that may have been true early on but it's not true now\nIt's not true now and this guy Jeff Flake\nShe does not remember who invited her to the party her how she heard about it she does not remember how she got to the party she does not remember in one house the assault allegedly took place\nOf that house was located with any specificity perhaps most importantly she does not remember how she got from the party back to her house\nHer inability to remember this detail racist significant questions she told the Washington Post the party took place near the Columbia Country club the club is more than seven miles from her childhood home as the crow flies and\nShe testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from childhood home she also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both but she couldn't remember\n\nDr Ford was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door and subsequently ... accepting the house she also has also described wanting to make sure that she did not look like she'd been attacked\nBut she has no memory of who drove over or when nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as a driver no one\nGiven this all took place before cellphones arranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did but that she called anyone else there after\nThat's convenient because then they can look at phone records\nShe does however remember a small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault for example she testified that she had exactly one beer at the party was taking no medication at that time of the alleged assault and I will continue\nThis after the break but as I said last week during the course of this questioning by this prosecutor it was devastating\nAnd then we have the experts judicial analyst and a host to the other one is she doing what is she doing she screwing up does\nThat mean fish doesn't mean anything to the American it means everything\nEverything is it safe for you\nShe testified said Kavanaugh son he comes up and he's\nAnd they tell you this woman's
