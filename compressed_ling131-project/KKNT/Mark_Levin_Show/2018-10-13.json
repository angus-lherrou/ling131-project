American communities are very important issues\nBut the fact is we're not sending Kanye West to the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the death to I Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact that he cannot he doesn't have that that just the other day\nHe was talking about a spin programs and how we needed to have more spin program that had to turn around and ask his colleague what ... me and\nWeapons what happens when ... says what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now Kanye West of what happens when the girls don't read gr\n[noise] kinda tricked me 'cause she made her ... really good point she rambled alone but he made several good points there's nobody knows what to do all those mulch asked if if a welfare they can't we can't work I'm Sorry\n... Michael Eric Dyson is another pundit or here's what he said about Kanye West this is white supremacy my ring true of course I'm a black market\nMoving with white races ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles Kanye West is engaging in one of the most in the various practices and yet how black body and brain are the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments\nI don't know how much more I can take\nIt to me that you notice they didn't talk about the guy sitting next to\nJim Brown yeah mhm not one single weren't mentioned about he was sitting right next door\nAnd he also Jim Brown said that he does not want to denigrate the flag and where he playing in the NFL today he would not be taken a neat\nYeah out of work has been said about\nWe got him he can Hammond a little bit uh in in black media but not not the way Kanye West has been hammered\nMichael Eric Dyson also said this current listen to this\nBut I miss the old time gay understood that we're dealing with serious insidious forces that undermined is the kind who joined with genes easy to talk about\nYou know a black excellence and the quest for black excellence and that was being wrong black I missed the Kanye who loves to pop culture just the other day I got Lynch bought some cricket drops into their savings ain't got someone to be\nGetting major pay will not get my check they taking tax so\nWe we pay and the cops but not the black so I missed that Conyers who brings high intelligence his friend Jaycee said back then back when the police were al ... black men there are ways in which hip hop can serve useful for him to articulate valuable ideas that people of color flying residents\nIn the application to our situation right now this country is a ... he was kind of a mess not Kanye West not cutting it as best and that's the real tragedy for my dear\nFriend and great artist ... Kirk I thought Kanye West me and a little bit [laughter]\nI mean Iraq hungry you're talking about jobs for the black community and start talking about we need to focus more on the community you know maybe get some job some industry or something in those areas made perfect sense to me\n... one of the things Kanye West said was that wearing the mega had made him feel powerful he felt like Superman he said because\nYou grow up without a father and wearing the mega kept gives them a sense of power and David Gergen a is a guy that worked in both Republican administrations in democratic ... he's a punted on CNN here's what he said about what Kanye West at about a wearing the ... to feel more masculine\nAgree with what you invented by Mossad a lesson I and I have no trouble with President circle and celebrities are White House enjoying each other's company you know started way back where the ... heart in Nineteen twenty calling in al ...\nAnd it goes all the way after Richard Nixon calling in Elvis Presley a man with cameras by the way he very much wanted the cameras there I you know so that that is part of the presidential tradition but I think what you're putting your finger on is a judgment that goes into doing it\nIn the face of this horrific storms so much suffering or in the country it would have been so much better to postpone Kanye West for ... for four or five days I have conversations in person can't do the people who are suffering some I\nHave a serious conversation in the White House for God's sakes about the relationship of storms the climate change and when we're going to do something serious about that as opposed to having a ...\nAnd that is what is uh I I think so disarming I don't know about Kanye West mental condition and I don't know about what I what I did pick up on something I haven't really thought about he kept saying about this hat and putting his hat on that and this\nHad on may feel like a man and I kept wondering is that what's going on with some of them in this country and their relationship with Trump is paying for Trump\nMake them feel more masculine I just don't know the answer to that but boy literature and overcoming over and I put in that session\nNo for crying out loud Kirk I guess putting my mega campus is cheaper\nOr without side effects compared to buy agra I guess [laughter]\nStart shaking my lower on our former for black men are just\nSo we're making headway so why would you stop\nWe could go one little thing a Gergen said this goes back a long way Richard Nixon calling in Elvis ...

the friend is Brian mud I uh\nAlways always privileged to be here with you do a morning show and West Palm beach W. J. you know a mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and always always a privilege to be here with you now I broke it out of a couple of concept on him\nIn recent weeks out what it is the the premise the premise is that if you step Alicia anything at a false premise you build anything on top of a false premise it's all gonna fail\nSo I don't embrace the false premise also talk about there being two sides histories one side effects\nAnd that all kind of goes hand in hand I got eight of the things over the course of time I'm libel to break 'em all out on yeah\nThis is my third one is called a sliding scale of morality\nWhat we've got ourselves in is a massive massive sliding scale of morality right now by the way around is actually one name I Know it's kind of crazy right now much not by much but morality is actually winning\nSome of what we're talking about a week ago had to do with Brett Kavanaugh and how the average American actually viewed Kavanaugh's coming out of those hearings quick little recap on bat\nPrior to the Ford a cabin on hearing three percent more Americans according to Gallup and they had been polling on Capitol every single day for the day after the drop nomination of him but three percent more Americans had not thought he shouldn't be confirmed\nThen we come full circle and after everything at the time of the vote we had one percent and more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed it not in other words we went back to believe in him\nAnd ultimately that close but we had last weekend was endemic us the average American bullied brick yeah but I Believe that he should be confirmed and the United States Senate actually went ahead and did what we want it says sliding scale of morality and all told\nWe only had our public opinion changed by seven percent that entire process that was at seven percent in other words most people are pretty stuck in their basic morality\nBut a lot of times people will go you know how is it the best friend I've had over a year turn around and stab me in the back\nWell that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen it in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics whether you might disagree with and just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage moral outrage by the media on back of ... I mean President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality works\nUnless you're potentially this bond is Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno Chuck Schumer I Do so maybe you know as long as you're not there was ponder saying or or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo on a scale of one to ten say that one is evil\nTennis perfection we're all too was to nine\nAnd if it were ... were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that may well means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you started out and unless sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're decent person throughout much of your your life\nBut when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your interests first he will take others down\nThat's held a sliding scale morality worse bad to help people will stab others in the back when you thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here\nSo let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit so many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nBet you have people that defend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than ... I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place around need to begin with\nShoe you can make it up as you go every day you view things through the prism that you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science and what fraud they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial fraud the conversation\nThe reality is flawed bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you if it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it\nPeople will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd she I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I had somebody saying well her witness there's the ones that ended up repeating her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this was her said there may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which people could be they didn't remember\nAnother might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can get mid felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as you're reasons are good enough\nIt fit sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about the sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me or you get he may Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media that sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West and the oval office\nThat is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know where your moral compass happens to be\nOr you five six seven eight where are you where when you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life day to day\nGeorge Bush doesn't like black people but Donald Trump he doesn't like why people think about the only place well a record of what I Want to blame the rates right now huh how that\nHappened now\nBeing that you are probably more ... than the average person out there you know how the game has always been played Democrat politics are what their identity politics they're meant to divide their mental cause friction division or men also importantly to do one key people down\nWhat we've seen every time people get an opportunity\nWell that is an opportunity to open their mind remember was talking about just a few minutes ago sliding scale morality but also finding people door open minded now historically we've seen well over Ninety percent\nOf black adults vote for Democrats\nIt with any group of people we ever agree Ninety percent of the time but why is it bad for decades hell we'd had black adults that were breaking Ninety percent plus it's time\nFor a Democrat no open mindedness no division of thought buying into the identity politics but nothing ever changed\nAnd we see that we're still the country where a man\nFrom the poorest neighborhood in the country can go on to become the most renowned neurosurgeon in the world and by the way be part of the Trump Administration and a Republican and now we see that one of the top entertainers in the world self made near billionaire\nCan also like Donald Trump and be a Republican and that is the problem\nBecause that is where the Democrats get exposed as soon as there's an opportunity for diversity of thought and that comes through opportunity and the one thing if we take a look at George W.
