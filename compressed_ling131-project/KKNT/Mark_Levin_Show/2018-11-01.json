talking about the fourteenth amendment yesterday I interviewed John nice man the former dean of Chapman University school of law and we talked about this here's what President Trump said\nFrom immigration some legal scholars to leave you with US citizenship without tension ... executive order ... have you thought about this law it was always told me that you need a constitutional amendment one and you don't need a\nNumber one number one you don't need that number two lessons you well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nSo how ridiculous that were the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas it's ridiculous and it has to and have you talked about that with counsels young where in the process in the process it will happen\nWith an executive order that's what you're talking about are saying but I didn't think anybody knew that but me I thought it was the only one China though is\nAn issue when can he do this with an executive order\nWidely because let's let's be real clear ... aren't those the president cannot amend the constitution and executive order\nCongress can amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court ... be able to amend the constitution by your feeling adjustment or ruling and I think that that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship\nIt does anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizens all the time to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction me and it doesn't mean anybody who happened to be subject to outlawed because they're physically present here that meant something much more complete that mad\nOr when the lead into the country being part of the body politic\nAnd that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise we now though so that would mean that the children of citizens\nOr the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment but the children of temporary visit or whether the court either or student visa\nUm or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution and up rather than if you're trying to faithfully apply that cause that was drafted\nRatified and an adult men to the people that after\nForty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties have some sort of footnote which people a point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to that rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nThey do they apply liver at all and it's ridiculous that said that they have to provide free education to the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection\nClause that excited a footnote that says what their their butt off of citizens if they're born here but that was not a whole year it was hot it is in that case it was what we call ... ... is that the Supreme Court for the back of the ad added something\nWe come back I'll tell you about what the author of the fourteenth amendment to some clause that his name is senator Jake of Howard also there was a night Eighteen eighty four Supreme Court case a rule that of Native American born\nUnder the jurisdiction of a Native American tribes not unilaterally make himself the United states citizen then was Eighteen eighty four case Eighteen Ninety eight case to court ruled that child born in this country to legal\nResident Chinese immigrants was included in the birthright citizenship but they have never ruled that a child born to illegal aliens on American soil is an automatic citizen yet that is how that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted and what I Believe Donald Trump is doing with this executive order is trying to spark\nA Supreme Court challenge to the executive order that ultimately will go all the way up to the Supreme Court a and these justices she hopes and I hope will rule the way the senator Jacob powered who drafted this intended it what is Howard said when he drafted it had it for you

just a handful of industrialized nations where that's the case but uh but I'll check it out\nAnd I know most countries are obviously I'm not sure I'm sure I'm sure that I Know but\nIt also that also makes that also makes Harry Reid wrong when he said there's no sane country that would allow this clip by just not played you\nOkay All right\nWell I'll I'll check it\nOut I don't think it's nearly a hundred but Greg I'll check it out so of course I check it out\nAnd about New Zealand let me tell you a what a New Zealand to children born in New Zealand or on board a ship or aircraft registered in New Zealand on or after January two thousand six\nWill acquire New Zealand citizenship my birth only if at least one parent is a New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident so I don't know how old a great kid he is but I'm assuming he's born before January one two thousand six in which case\nI suspect that I'm the greatest white\nUh but no more no moss as at work [laughter] for July one two thousand six four New Zealand for his assertion that they are over a hundred countries I'm calling about thirty five only one only to a would be industrialized countries and that would be us and Canada\nThe ones that have unrestricted a birthright\nArgentina Barbados release Bolivia Canada's I mentioned chili Costa Rica Cuba America Ecuador El Salvador Gambia Grenada I'm waiting for the

point in front of you can turn each night you're the one two three four five six thirty six thirty seven little short of a hundred and not one of the European country now could be wrong\nIf anybody has very formation we provided this is just a kind of a quick look in appears that greatest completely wrong about\nHis assertion that that uh uh every a country in a in Europe or allows this attack no country in Europe allows it a an even Lucy has changed their laws so I'm just saying looking at the data and are just not just don't see it but ... you think I'm On call back and correct me\nAnd giving you the quote from the draft or of that provision\nSubject to the jurisdiction they're often the fourteenth amendment senator kick off our hope this will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners\nSomehow some way that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted as meaning that anybody in this country where they are legally or illegally and as I saw a sign on our daughter on us soil that son or daughter just automatically an American citizen nonsense says the draft or on the fourteenth amendment\nAnd a Trump is right that are either certainly rare he's wrong when he says we're the only country uh there are others though the other one uh I suppose that is um when my calls difficulties Canada\nBut Greg ... and you heard him that every country in
