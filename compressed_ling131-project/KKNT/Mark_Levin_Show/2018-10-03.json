like child he wouldn't be laughed at the same grade I guarantee you if you do this you know in that way and\nNow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what is a reporter doing working in democratic politics\nIt's great I guarantee you that if you do this in other words you know obviously\nYou were threatening the people

laughing\nVery hard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody said something because\nIs Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did that to me there is no way in the world that

he asked me about the novel is\nWhether he had been found to live and I said Sam how could you leave this going on the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know the multi millionaire he's riding high ABC and now he feels a duty to take a shot at the president simply because he depended judge Kevin I'm\nLarry claiming a you said you had a step anomalous under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell he had a very good memory the memory you know what favorite phrase of the Clinton people was\nI have no specific regular recollection means I remember something I Can't remember now on the front of the ... justice so no he wouldn't admit or anything and like I said he he was found to rely on those\nWere

a senior fellow at the London Center for policy research please welcome to the program Jay harm the J\nWe haven't ... we're talking years much to talk to you\nYeah that was back when we were both young froze that's right now you're [laughter] what does that make me realize how where where are you stationed you argue in London\nA well known London Center for policy research is named after Dr Herbert London who is the head of the center so everyone that kind of people I Want to fall into thinking I'm going on then I'll correct [laughter]\nWhat'd you even when we talk years ago we talked about this article that I that I mentioned called race to the top of that you wrote in January two thousand six one of the American spectator and you told about an incident a political meeting but she went to with your dad tell us about it [noise]\nWell this was a formative and a transformative moment for me a\nLot of fun my political engagement that I was just a fly on the wall of a sudden I was sixteen Seventeen something like that [noise]\nAh my father got invited to this meeting wasn't that politically active buddy was a prominent figure and this was in\nThe uh Flatbush section of more of a new way of reducing Charles Schumer to us ah and I think this is before he ran for Congress is what he was becoming a a state assembly person [noise] so um\nThey were introduced here and they were trying to sell it to us he was not a very impressive figure I must say it was a wine a a laser on ah didn't seem to have much confidence that they would try and put it forward and and so\nOn the basis and unfortunately the the all the assumptions that went into this horrible but they could afford on the basis that he's going to get the blacks or even UK if you know the ... section\nIt tends to be a wide section of a single family homes and for whatever\nReason over the years it evolved in that way [noise] but there's a cluster of apartment houses on every new cave at where blacks reside in [noise]\nAnd frankly they were there were not violent there was it wasn't any kind of like the one oh classes going on in the streets or there was no fear it ... if there was a problem I didn't detect the problem I Lived there but to go wherever I had a problem with it it would only been on a strictly racist type of basis\nAnd\nSo they brought us and they see this guy is a genius he's got a plan to get the blacks are fairly new K\nReally how's it going to do it well and it's just going to do so he's going to make some kind of a state funded refurbishing\nThose buildings so our paperwork like he's helping the books and of course they can't refurbish it with the people living there so the ... the people out to other locations and while they refer but see then no\nTurn into a type of a a co op units where you have to buy your way back and there was swimming that most of those people would not have the funds necessary to buy back and and so by then they would already maybe took will take a year or two for the construction they would be in the new area anyway they wouldn't bother to come back and then\nThey were selling these apartments are white people and that would be the solution\nSo he was a man who was Korea was launched on a racist premise on a manipulation of political power to achieve racist as absolutely disgusting\nNow Jay this not Chuck Schumer he was not in office he was running for New Yorkers simply at the time\nI I I ... to the bathroom my recollection there I see I I'm not positive on the day so I'd have to go back in his you know Korea it was either is it seems logical to me that we didn't know him I don't want to get it would have been running for state assembly\nNow he stood up how many people were were at this meeting roughly\nYou know it's not the kind of thing you say in front of a large crowd it was you know ten twelve people who are at some clout mhm\nAnd I guess it was a a sort of a sense that you could you know talk this kind of inside baseball [noise] talk I mean I was very very uncomfortable with what ... what a lot of the promises that went into that so uh\nYou know interaction I mean there there was an assumption that of course we want to get rid of the blacks and that this young Harvard educated you know with that but it's going to come up with a great solution I had accomplished that it was awful\nAnd it was humorous planned the one that you just outlined about relocating them on the basis of these are going to be refurbished and then they get right up first refusal they wouldn't be able to to our foreign to pay for it and voila they would be gone just with Schumer outlining the plan\nRight and that's how they were selling it to say look what a genius he came up with a strategy would have thought is this is a massive stroke\nMhm now this plant never gotten implement it or do you know why not\nWell they did it in for months and then they do they refer to sing but they underestimated the capacity of the people to move back they actually were able to raise the father came back to them and it's pretty much the neighborhood is the same and it's always been except\nThat uh the blacks ended up with the ... better housing what it's all for the good but now is that the U.S has what is your father or think of this plant one of my father was not really that political figure and uh and I didn't\nReally disgusted with him I was a teenager and to me it was sort of all things mhm so\nUm why did you take so long before writing about that you were sixteen years old but you didn't write about that was a\nKid at the time but that but that's really what got me motivated to politics at all the years as I was getting engaged and as a ride I used to write for it to the Jewish\nIs it that eventually a broad and into the Washington DC magazines and I was working my way up the ladder so to speak I always wanted to tell my story and in fact in Nineteen Ninety six\nI was a there was a fellow named Robert L Virgo who's running against sure for Congress and I actually want to apply to become his campaign manager and like you know who you like where you come from\nThat so you know that I this man is\nIs a you know evil personified or if I could do I think the ring of that I was so so of course uh the local Republican has ever heard of me at the time and I and I didn't get the job but [noise] but uh so just to show you how I said I was about that and I was particularly offended\nBecause he was the congressman for a very orthodox Jewish section in New York [noise] uh he would go around and and handed to them or talk a little year this stuff like that mhm and then\nHe would take their votes these is a really wonderful people I think would you vote for all the evil society as a law that you couldn't show was the most reliable vote for Bush is anything any type of thing that that involves\nA you know undermining right traditional society is the most reliable vote and his power came from Orthodox Jews sweet people who do we ... we\nWere putting ... article up on Larry on the dot com race to the top by Jay Honda Jay thank you very much for coming on maybe this time somebody will finally asked Chuck Schumer about this Jay things coming on I actually ...\nAnd I really appreciate it always a plus\nYou got it and now Schumer is blasting Kavanaugh for lacking the appropriate demeanor of a judge what kind of demeanor did you show when you were pushing that racist plan to get rid of blacks\nSir if you say well maybe he's telling the truth and maybe he's not he doesn't belong on the Supreme Court\nAnd I think most Americans are saying that again even if you want to discount and some people do what happens when he was Fifteen in high school and Eighteen in college\nAnd how were you when you propose that race a scheme that Jay on that just spoke about\nYou Tana discount what he's saying and protesting at age fifty three\nHey if you were a racist in Nineteen Seventy four you're probably a racism twenty Eighteen right\nWhen it flies in the face being truthful unbelievable that's the key question here their demeanor you sure didn't show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing there is partisanship\nHe brought out the most raw form of partisanship so under coming up someone on the district court federal appeals court let alone the Supreme Court\nAnd\nHe did not\nShow any semblance\nTo always being a hundred per cent honest and truthful which is what we need in a Supreme Court justice\nThis is back on the way no way a movie like

reject individual is liberty is for individual\nLiberty is for individuals and individual ism is not defined by how much the government can give you liberty is not defined by how much you can lobby the government\nLiberty is defined by the circle of mine and on ... writes that is around each and every one of us at birth that humanity\nMark what does this have to do with anything it has to do with everything our constitution was set up to protect the individual and an order society our constitution is the manifestation the governing manifestation of the declaration of independence\n\nWhat you're seeing play out in front of you is the consequence\nOf the ... from our constitutional order that is you're seeing post constitutional as\n\nIt's always been interesting to me and I've studied this for decades\nCow Marxist socialists whenever they call themselves can talk about the people's revolution doing this and that for the people when in fact there are all about centralized part a crowd like iron fisted government\nElites who they call experts\nRemaking society they do not like a messy society where individuals are all pretty much doing what they want to do\n\nBecause utopian ism is retrieved by the experts by the masterminds\nSociety mark I still don't know what this has to do with anything stay with me please\n[noise] when you're decentralization of government and I've written this down I'm just telling you as it is when you have the central location of government you have the government more and more making decisions and you're the government more and more and making decisions about everything\n\nBig things in small things minute and huge we have a massive administrative state that does that every day\nWe also have elements within our country that have gotten incredibly strong much stronger much more muscular than they frame has ever imagine and that's our courts especially the Supreme Court\n\nWhen you have the central ... power and when you have more and more decisions being made by the court by entities within the federal government then there's a lot at stake is it there\nWhen the federal government's making decisions the fifty states the territories are much less important must less influential\n\nAs the central government gets stronger and stronger and more and more ubiquitous you\nCan't escape it when the federal government makes a decision it doesn't matter what state you moved to you can't escape it it's a winner take all situation like abortion like Obamacare whatever the issue is it's a winner take all\nThat's not at all what the constitution created and so in many respects where they post constitutional government they post constitutional Supreme Court and on and on and on we absolutely do and I've talked about that at length I've written about it at length\n\nSo what you're watching now is the breakdown\nOf the constitutional order in the United States Senate respecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this as the institution of the United States Senate as it sits today is not what the constitution created\nIt's not what the constitution created you had this progressive movement that became especially strong in the earliest period the turn of the last century the early Nineteen hundreds as it was building in the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd you're the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always\nA desired result for the heart left and then you're the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy the United States Senate senators are elected way members of the house are elected no there are six year terms of course\nNot their elected by the people of the state the Senate has no actual purpose anymore\nOh I understand treaties and so we're that's not my point in terms of its fundamental foundational purpose it's been bastard that\nThe Senate collectively was supposed to represent the states collectively in the federal Congress\nTo members from each state states would determine how they're chosen they can be elected by the people although very few where they can be selected by the state legislatures most of the more\nBut this so called populism movement\nAnd the progressive movement eliminated that\n\nAnd so you have this kind of pure democracy as opposed to Republicanism\nWhen it comes to the United States Senate and you see the consequences of that you also see the consequences and another institution the United States Supreme court the United States Supreme court even though some of my constitutional is and conservative friends heated Lee disagree with me I've written about this and the ... versus Madison decision\nThe Supreme Court seized power\nSeized power from the other federal branches\n\nJefferson knew immediately what took place as did other individuals who who believed in diversified a government\n\nHave libertarians today that argue strongly in favor of Madison versus Marbury and when you really read the case and you know the history of it it's a bastard ... not only the constitution\nBut the parties involved there's no way Marshall chief justice Marshall should have been involved in that
