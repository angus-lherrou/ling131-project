Chuck\nSchumer sexual assault allegation show we facilitate Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations because we believe that the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation show that all allegations are important\nWe believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations are important we believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations are serious and most importantly we believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations\nShould be believed healing happens here at the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation show if you would like to join the Chuck Schumer sexual allegations Joe you may he'll by calling eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven\nAll right so hey what a week or ... it's been huh what a what a few weeks it's been\nA it is yourself with a friend Bryan mud in for the great one mark all of it and by the way because there's always one\nThis is not the place to share your there Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations if you learn nothing by now you go directly to the FBI and you demand an investigation and then be sure to look over their shoulder and tell them how they can conducted all throughout the course of that investigation\nBut the the absurdity of the situation is that Chuck Schumer the last time I uh was joining you\nCouple of Tuesday's ago hadn't made that statement earlier in the day\nBefore we even had the hearing last Thursday well I Believe her and that's what that's really what's all about\nThat is what this all really it was all about\n... out about the Supreme Court about Christine forward\nIt's about what kind of country we're going to be what can the country are best would end up\nRepresenting in a world in which someone as distinguished has incredible\nAnd you know otherwise clean as Brett Kavanaugh if he can be taken out of the highest levels of justice\nWe're all screwed the moment that somebody comes out of left field with an allegation actually sure to a very personal story with you and I received stories from across the country and believable responded to a to all of you\nWho who share their stories about extortion about threats about people that I'd done bad things to you and here's the the good news and the bad news\nThe good news and the bad news of the situation is that we're not screwed in this country\nThe bad news is we're two votes away today from being screwed in this country so it's a big time wake up call and a reminder reminder about several things for example\nIt's a reminder right now that if you are in Chicago and you're a cubs fan and you're a leftist wow it must suck to be right now must really stuck to meet you in fact if I were you I won't even joked about\nWhat's the point what's the point you know the second but it's also a reminder that we are right and and that's a line that fine line\nAnd I got a message for you if you are familiar with my work then you have hurt me talk about the premise and the premise is what I operate off of I Will never embraced the false one\nAnd if you build anything on a false premise anything built upon it is indeed it's going to fail\nThem sample when you are Chuck Schumer and you say hey you know what I Believe or you have no evidence you have no testimony of nothing\nI Believe her that's a false premise and guess what yellows but we all do\nSo that's the the first the most important thing the second is that there are two sides to stories\nIn one side effects now here the facts and it's something that drove me crazy crazy crazy crazy last Thursday and bless her heart Susan Collins who\nDelivered a speech and among the things I never imagined that I Would be saying at any point today one that oh my God Chuck Grassley some juice left who\nGoes by those funky\nInto some towns\nSusan Collins is afternoon delivered the most remarkable speech I've ever heard a senator deliver who the heck happened near I got a at a lot of interesting the interesting things going on\nBut in the context that there are two sides to stores one set of facts by Thursday you had so many people including the aforementioned Susan Collins who is unbelievable today\nWho said that you know what she was really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believable and ah you know so it was Brett Kavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people yeah you know they both were known and we're not no day we're not going to be right somebody was lying\nSomebody was committing perjury\nSomeone testifying last Thursday was really really committing an act of evil\nAnd that person based on all the information available is Christine four seats filled out people are treating her with kid gloves but in this moment where by age to vote margin we're advancing to the final votes tomorrow and Brett Kavanaugh approximately five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important that Christine Ford saying that she is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nBut she is not allowed to just went off into the sunset is though she never made those claims now there is not going to be any accountability there's no way in the world but the the Senate Judiciary committee is going to pursue her for perjury\nThey should they should there should be a full investigation of her but as long as I have an opportunity to do so which she did it's an act of evil Christine for\nTrying to ruin a man's wife said she is one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said\nIt's wrong that's wrong and it's important that when we are confronted with acts of evil in this society be false accusations by someone like Christine board they are called out for what they are and she is made to to have to account for what she is which is a perpetrator\nA woman who committed an act of evil\nBut there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay it's ... I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nAfter a long way already held accountable for murder right the one where she tried to do to break out and I am one hundred percent certain\nIt was Brett Kavanaugh machine\nNot trying to effectively ruined that man's life his family's life\nHow evil do you have to do that so I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did and it's important\nOnce again we don't just wide off because break out I was going to make it through this thing\nAnd ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored\nBecause there will be others we ended up a thorn in the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just go in the way of uh I don't know oh Chuck Schumer's credibility for the Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in ... I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just why you know\nNot and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are we're on eight ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes and right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise then we all need to acknowledge what happened here\nAnd who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about a day as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are now a couple of things are just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way\nIt really has been that kind of a wake has meant that kind of couple of weeks cut off three months I mean shoot pretty much trolling Clarence Thomas them and understand what Kavanaugh's been through an emotional I didn't know it was kind of feel like we were through another election here this whole cabinet thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... ah yourself with a friend\nWe saw about what's that image shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be getting prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media and the politicians did to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere are we today but it's kind of interesting by a forty six forty five Martian Americans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed now they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first as\nPublic opinion despite all the emotions oh the emotions the old enough and throw Spartacus across the board to gang raping whatever\nPublic opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom is it in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and it is particular case the United States Senate\nIs doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen near\nBy a slim margin Brett Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary boats to advance to the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is so I could graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably allows people in your life that oppose you right how's that work out for you and let me ask you for the angry leftist but you argue politics with you ever get anywhere or you just get angry\n[noise] do you think they're one of the\nFolks that's part of that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place [noise]\nSo I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they are in our lives and our universe\nComing up next to talk about that and how to be persuasive\nAnd who can be persuaded\nAnd how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy and I am in my head\nYou listen to what David as from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk\nAnd how much time and I have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely right I truly love my ... and I know you will to trust me once you feel how much support the ex cheer provides\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ex chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ex chairs on sale now for one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now that's ...
