may not like we do stay with what we do they know that if we say we're going to do something\nWe fall when the president for that whether it was it the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was a NATO

and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years haven't had time\nAnd I'm a believer in turn on that topic you have to the south lawn for not to know when you step outside and around someone else to do

we doing his campaign for that point so I look forward to support him to find them and I actually think that\nI wanted to do this because Nikki Haley ambassador to the United nations has been very special in that she's done an incredible job\nShe is a fantastic person very importantly what you also is somebody that she has been in the United nations from the beginning with us\nFrom the beginning and weren't really the sort of the campaign has been barely a long time very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but at the end of the year I Want to take a little time off or whether she's been a very successful\nYou know governor of South Carolina for years and then she uh she did this and this is\nPossibly even more in tune with what's going on in the world and very dangerous thing a lot of things but using that as soon as you look and we've done a fantastic job to gather yourselves a lotta problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning of\nNorth Korea was a massive wherever it is moving along and move it along really nicely I can speak for\nSecretary of

different city than anything [noise] but uh I just wanted to let you know so at the end of the year next year will be leaving and it will be\nGotten in touch I Know that one of the evidence is you know all the players\nThat that was really the thing I think she said the United nations she got to know the players who she got to know China Russia ah\nIndia she knows everybody every first day but it's just like it or maybe a couple of normal for us to get all like to say that you know they really like and how they think maybe more importantly there is a factor\nShow the gear just wanted to tell you we will miss you at least we can all the time we will miss you nevertheless new set of it but I Want to thank\nYou very much\nNow or ... friends in the media really really really wanted her to leave in a hot to suggest that she was not happy with\nA boss like Donald Trump instead she thanked him she was grateful\nShe said she intends to campaign for him and twenty twenty no intention to run against him and twenty twenty to primary spoke respectfully you've been interesting how people leave the Trump Administration this turbulent chaotic administration in space such nice things about it\nAnd as for why I Believe she leaving her that she just burned out I think it's a difficult job and difficult boss he's demanding he puts a lot of stuff in the inbox and I think a lot of people can't keep up the man sleeps four or five hours a night\nHe's frenetic he wants to accomplish a lot and I think for people that have to do the stuff he wants to do with a lot of work a lot of pressure\nProbably two years under this president is like four years on any other president\nPeople come and people go to the story about the new rock knew the legendary coach of no reading and he was ill one and he had an assistant coach the game in the in the system won and won pretty handily\nAnd new rock and he had admitted to one of the seniors at the college that bothered him that uh this assistant\nWon the game and his dad and to me and said well\nWe're all useful but none of us is necessary\nAnd that includes the president United States\nThe sun is going to rise in the eastern set in the west irrespective of what happens we keep going\nHe was on with a John Dickerson who hosts the Sunday chat show on CBS and Dickerson told him the Democrats approved an election year Supreme Court nominee in Nineteen fifty eight when in fact they hadn't\nTalked about bringing up again the bill that would change the rules for investigating sexual assault in the Senate it's passed with bipartisan support but installed if they're going to be action on that now\nYeah Charles ... and our our differences between the house and Senate but that's something I Know they're done before the end of the year and the other way you either later\nSo it's not up to Maine where to go shooting a solution between the house and set up\nAt I fix back then we will get a result here before the end of this Congress it's also important to underscore that and it's part of our big fight over this nomination battle over taxes last year and there's been an awful lot of bipartisan cooperation with past\nToo overwhelming by overwhelming margins to bill just last week in the middle of the ... ah there's food on opioids and a five year of Central Africa if we've also don't appropriations better on a bipartisan basis on any time that I think it is so the notion that the Senate or something like\nBroken over those is simply that awkward prime\nMinister later those things have happened but this is a different order and Democrats are pointing not only the way this was handled by in the history of partisanship on the Supreme Court your decision to block Merrick Garland is something they see as a as having kicked off a new stage in the partisanship associated with the Supreme Court nominees\nSo they don't ... up to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time a Senate controlled by a different party\nFrom the president confirmed that Supreme Court justice to a vacancy created in the middle of a presidential election\nThey also conveniently forgotten the job on the set of Nineteen Ninety two when he was chairman of the ... the Democrats control as a Republican in the White House it went back and say occurred they wouldn't fill it also conveniently\nForgot but Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid Eighteen months before the end of Bush forty three shut up of spring cord vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it\nWith also either ... or say prime minister later I don't think that's right and I think that the ... and our nominated Brennan and native for Congress was a democratic controlled and also on the biting rule Joe Biden was in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked and he said to\nNot have the nomination come up before the election but that it couldn't come up after the election and so a Democrat\nSay when they hear you're doing this as they say he's creating new rules to actually knew what he wants to do and as you've written in your book the long game when you do that it actually hurts democracy\nYeah well that's not exactly a thought at all what happens you're on your completely missed controlling what happened what gave me was the history of this I Know the history of this I've spent a lot of time on this throughout my career what I did was entirely consistent with what the history of the sudden it's been in that situation going back to Eighteen eighty\nSo John Dickerson the CBS says no you're wrong because the Democrats approved an election year Supreme Court nominee in Nineteen fifty six John King of CNN\nThey also conveniently forgotten the Joe Biden said and I think Ninety two when he was ... Democrats control the Senate Republican in the White House it went back in the uk or they wouldn't fill it\nI don't think that's right in Nineteen fifty six an hour nominated Brennan and data for Congress where the Democratic controlled and also on the Bible rule Joe Biden was in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was locked\nInto a thought at all it up and your audience you're completely misconstrue and whatever\n[noise] I'm a college right on the history of Eisenhower date a recess appointment in Nineteen fifty six the formal nomination\nFor that it didn't happen until after the presidential election year of college\n[noise] but if I had a Republican\nPresident Eisenhower to deliver it will be right back stay\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] yeah you meet your heart listen to me we've gotta talk high blood pressure in theory you and your well into what we used to be so much more than ... you've been ignoring me I Know you think I'm just gonna keep taking away forever\nAnd you're wrong you can do so much more to control your high blood pressure\nDoing the minimum isn't doing enough I Wonder a lot of pressure and to quit whenever I Want that you didn't know that but I like my job treat me that I mean do you think green to nibble on every once in a while\nAnd maybe we can do some exercise on occasion let's get to it after all we're in the ... listen\nTo your heart don't let it quit on high blood pressure can lead to a stroke heart attack or death get your blood pressure to a healthy range before it's too late find out how hard dot org slash blood pressure checked change control the message from the American Heart Association the American stroke association and the ad council\nWho else wants to discover how to invest in cash\nFlowing apartments without dealing with a single tenant join us for a fast start to our free training a vet and discover a proven system created by a landscaper who went from mowing lawns to controlling over eight thousand units you'll discover how to safely invested in apartments using little or none of your own money\nHow to create a monthly passive income stream that will allow you to retire in as little as three to five years argument or be experts in apartment investing education for over Fifteen Years will be in the Phoenix area sharing this unique system be one of the first thirty callers now to get your seat at this class free call eight hundred\nTo three oh twenty sixty eight investing in apartments requires little money down in low risk is trained properly learn the secrets from the experts at Ari mentor in just two hours called eight hundred to three oh twenty sixty eight and be one of the first thirty callers that\nEight hundred to three oh twenty sixty eight you have nothing to lose and the legacy to gain\nSo called eight hundred to three oh twenty sixty eight\nCredit products are made by Web back rate in terms of credit history Amazon and not a sponsor of this promotion other restrictions apply the website for detail\nHow to get into critic on a trip to the emergency room\nMoving expenses there is a million ways to get into credit card debt but one sure way to start getting out of von ... access to online on secured loans from two thousand dollars for\nThirty five thousand dollars a competitive race and no extra charges were paying back early over five hundred thousand customers have experienced the convenience of alone drove on no wonder about has an a plus rating from the better Business Bureau the application taking minutes in the ... by\nFor dirty pm central time Monday to friday funds are deposited as soon as the next business day and now a Bible also give you a fifty dollar Amazon dot\nCom gift card and that's your first thing that has made on time to check your loan options and to get their special radio off or go to Yvonne dot com today and enter ... forty\nSix forty six what a blind catch Avi A.

standard is simply lifted at tolerating slavery was a central to get the southern states on board she might have had a point but the claim that the constitution somehow pre ordained at the end of slavery F written is pure whitewashing given that it took a bloody civil war\nTo do so\nAnd he talks about the three ... deal that was made between the north in the south\nAnd how reprehensible that deal was another person who appears to be pretty ignorant about history he's an article by Walter Williams called slavery quote\nAt the time of the Seventeen eighty seven\nConstitutional convention slaves were about forty percent of the population of some southern colonies he talks about how the southerners want it to ... count each late as one person in order to increase their representation in the north because they want it to limit the power of a slave holding ... states\nWanted them not to count them at all till they agreed on telling them three this as a compromise\nQuote many criticize writes Walter Williams this compromise as proof of racism which is what this guy said about round to Sanders\nMy question to these grossly uninformed critics is whether they would have found it more preferable for slaves to be counted as whole person's slave counted this whole person would have given slave holding southern states much more political power\nOr which critics of the founders prefer that the northern delegates not compromise and not allow slaves to be candidate all if they did it is likely that the constitution would not have been ratified\nThat's the question the emerges whether blacks would have been better off with northern states haven't gone there way and southern states haven't gone there's resulting in no U.S Constitution and no union\n\nAnd then walked Williams quote Patrick Henry who set of this three fifths compromise quote as much as I deplore slavery I see that prudence forbids its abolition into quote one of the delegates dream well streams Wilson said this about the compromise\nThat it laid the foundation for vanishing slavery out\nOf this country and of course there's also a website maintained by the federal government called constitution Centre dot org\nAnd talks about this three fifths deal quote in truth it was a political deal that many delicate felt was essential to preserving the union the Madison was a slave owner he felt deeply conflicted about slavery\nBut he was a strong advocate of the constitution so we felt obligated to defend even the three this rule close quote what this guy criticizing Rhonda sand is is they're saying is that the Sanders was wrong when he said the fruits of compromise within central uh and that the\nStage had been set for the eventual abolition of slavery\nThis guy is not true and therefore around us and that is must apparently a racist oh my goodness [noise] Rhonda Sanders has called out the double standard all these anti Semite that are surrounding his uh his opponent\nDo just like the weather channel that guys out there doing the things that people are walking by like I was like oh they have to create a narrative\nYou do not do that with Andrew Gillum have us Andrew\nGillum why he had hair

United nations and vote for ... which is a complete bogus thing\nHe didn't have his hands up didn't say don't shoot but a President Obama opted to talk about America flaws and suggested that Fergus him with a microcosm of it\nObama's attorney general Eric Holder said when it comes to matters of race America has been a nation of cowards close quote\nAnd he said that there were a America right now or is involved in pernicious racism gay free examples says the push for voting rights was a new push for for a photo of voter id was an example of pernicious racism never mind the majority of blacks one\nPhoto voter id Putin said a as another example of pernicious racism the fact that black boys or expelled or suspended from school and a greater percentage than the other kids in that particular school\nHe a Jesse Jackson even sued and all white school board in Decatur, Illinois for cutting out a bunch of black kids are we're fighting after football game the argued that the all white um school board\nWas racist a and that the policy that applied to these black boys was racist\nDecatur defended itself by pointing out all around the country where the school board is all white or school board or consisting of poor people of color close call back black boys are still kicked out this portion leaf compared to other boys at that given given school why because they're misbehaving\nThe third example that a Eric Holder gays as an example of punishes racism or is the fact that they black\nCriminal defendant who commit to same crime as the white criminal defendant gets a longer sentence and that is true what Eric Holder didn't tell you is that the U.S and think commissioned a that came up with that with that that also said the reason is for is the fact that judges\nOr when it comes to sentencing will take into consideration eight defendants arrest record and it turns out the typical black to send it has a longer arrest record than typical white defend it as a result that black defend it gets a longer sentence nothing to do with racism or the U.S sentencing commission says that\nThe judges are taking into consideration legitimate factors that's all you got Eric
