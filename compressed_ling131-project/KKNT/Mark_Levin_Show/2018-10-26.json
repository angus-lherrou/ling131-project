I just wanted to write something by you and just get your thought on this um regarding a caravan what what'd you think about if we gave them the option when they get ear to\nUh we send them to Afghanistan or Iraq to colonize and help rebuild yeah get deported\nSo it's interesting the first I get on that right or what we would do is we get set up tent cities for them out they're giving him a job for one the true you're making five\nDollars an hour to help rebuild a fair you know for the able bodied people and if they have a skill you know doctors lawyers\nThe equipment operator as they can make up to ten dollars an hour\nAnd we help them out for a little bit and totally get their own jobs start a business or whatever else\nYou know transportation costs are tricky to get 'em over there but rather than have them in a foxhole next to you just just some some manual labor my lawyer\n... dollars that we're sending to heroin trio created a trend setter complicit Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras yeah we could use that money and send them over there and ah if they really want a job they want a better or wives will help them out\nAnd we got we we certainly have certainly have openings um I'm a fan of simplicity and I appreciate the creativity but I'm a fan of simplicity it's called we have borders you have a country our borders going to work and you could go back home

ever work it's not the way immigration should work [noise] uh James in California pay marketing but simply Larry how are you doing\nI'm doing it incredibly well what's up I'm\nOut here in California we haven't had a whole lot of Republican representation true on the ballot this year we've got two Democrats running for the Senate we don't have any Republicans on the ballot\nSo I Am for my hand in the ring I established your friends on Facebook I started getting things out and work at work on a write in campaign to see if we can get into the U.S Senate\nUm of\nAre you seeking to unseat\nDianne Feinstein\nYeah well that was you would be the one who's up as an shake 'em ... ah what what you\nNeeded to be out yeah\nWhat made the usual ... method not workable [noise]\nI mean where you where you like to go through the primaries and you know the ...\nThat is absolutely that is work normally I Would not running for senator however when we come to this point and there was no center to Republican in the race\nBut but it really helped me out of how many hours you Kevin ... own is than\n\nFrom what I understand we have\nTo Democrats all about that that's that's that's not possible or true so I I I and and honestly I mean if if it seems like a nice project\nAnd stuff you want to knock stuff out and do I buy a big fan of that and this crazy day and age who knows but uh\nI I think generally speaking if even in in crazy California\nIf you want to have even a ghost of a chance I got to find a lot of people to give you a lot of money\nAnd actually get in there into the arena and actually play for real otherwise it's kind of vanity project but hey or or just a or a Facebook ranch or whatever all of which is great are expressing ourselves is fantastic so I I Wish you well I Wish you truly do\nYou know I was in fact an interesting story you're\nAbout to say you know Dianne Feinstein opponent Billy on and only debate debate said California needs a new voice California state senator Kevin daily on\nUm ... ...\nIn California is his always been interesting to me Larry live there that was kinda funny on the stage last night yeah Larry a dentist breaker [noise] a lot of California

are my thoughts on some things and then the idea is that you share your thoughts\nAbout some things and we hope that uh that you will do so eight eight eight nine seven ... eight eight eight nine seven ... real quick as we begin or would you be the first on the movie everybody's talking about before the elections depths of the nation national issues his masterpiece is on DVD at about five days\nOctober thirtieth release dates or your topic today at destination movie dot com death of a nation movie dot com directed it so you know it's compelling so go get that destination movie dot com okay the mystery packages the story seconds the finger pointing continues and let's make a list of\nWhat we don't know and what we know this is how you stay sane throughout this entire thing right now my list of what we don't know and what we know may\nDiffer from yours you may think you know some things that I don't you may think some things that I think I Know are in dispute and that's why we have telephone lines are so um to join us\nHere's what we do not know we don't know who sent these packages that can be started the most basic we have no idea who sent these packages or why [noise]\nI and that's where you stop your toes to the first time it's like wait a minute don't we know that this is some expression of hate for for liberal or I conduct figures clearly sent by some nut bag on on the right we don't know any such thing\nYou know is that probably the greatest possibility yeah because we have our ... bags to\nKnow the little boy left as guys who shoot up baseball fields and and the left has tons of people who ah will shock you out of a restaurant and claw like zombies the doors to the Supreme Court and do all kinds of other fields off nonsensical thing we've uh we've we've got our crazy too\nBut you know the thing that that started to wrap itself around me when the story first began and and the and the tally of mysterious packages started to grow\nAnd you know this doesn't tend to be something we do and\nI and why in the world wouldn't exactly be now that's earth logic why would you do it sometimes you send somebody a pipe bomb because you want to kill him but you know ... nothing exploded yet you know what I mean\nAnd I think that it was the one in sources mailbox where the where the the white powder was nothing it was in art now there then by the way that doesn't make it okay if you send somebody something just to scare the or the ... out of them that's that's a terrorist act as well\nSo you don't have to blow up for you to have done something very very illegal\nBut is it okay for you if you keep that uh that hoax antenna primed and dialed in you bet it's okay mine is does it mean I'm declaring\nIt a hoax I'm telling you I Know it's a hoax I notice the left doing this to the left so that we can you know spread out and have some myth of equivalency\nLike yeah we're ... we got a lot of restaurants were chasing Ted Cruz of restaurants we at Maxine Waters advocating hooliganism but you have your crazies do you're trying to kill the Clintons and the Obamas and Joe Biden and Robert Deniro you people are just like us yet\nNo we're not okay because even if even if we do find that this is one conservative lunatic you know what that is one conservative lunatic\nWe have more to be sure but um it it's not our rank and file really hopped up activists who are out and doing things that countless thousands of leftist are doing\nAll the time there is no comparison so the thing that we don't know is who did this and why we do not know\nHere's what we do know a media culture that takes Trump's guts or will do anything to tag him with this bad story\nAnd that is why you actually get I mean I I heard Wolf Blitzer I was kind of funny I was getting out of the car a dollar and a serious actually I'm In the car [noise] Wolf Blitzer talking to some congressman and say we know we have CNN just if you ever have the president's ear tell them that we we really try to get things right and we're not involved\nIn fake news like will shut up dude it's pathetic it's sad I mean they've got a great idea of you in ... and you know want to go you know bill a tree house in the backyard never club meeting why don't you decided to start covering things fairly covering things honestly lose the corruption fire Jemma cost to get your act together\nYou don't lose the Trump Grange wouldn't syndrome and become a real news organization because the the cries of fake news are real and deserved invalid\nAn accurate and he just high above around mess and I'm going to your calls eight eight eight nine seven on stage eight eight eight nine seven on stage as the question hangs from the rafters\nShould the president dial back his rhetoric in view of the there's this package story or blah blah blah blah blah\nShort answer is no\nThere is nothing nothing in President Trump's rhetoric that somehow necessarily lead to somebody doing something like this even if it is a nut job conservative there is zero connection to be made there none by thinking people\nBy people who have had a bug up there but about Trump since the day he won there's plenty of material and they're going to use it and they're going to hammer it and they're going to bludgeon it and you know what it's gonna backfire to\nJust like Kevin are just like the caravan desk is going to backfire too you don't the voters are paying attention today say wait a minute what now this\nFirst we have a media apologist planted it embedded with the caravan trying to uh uh characterize it as as some noble pursuit\nAnd we have what the media and Senate Democrats did in the cabinet debacle and now they're taking this very admittedly unfortunate and scary story of devices showing up at a at some Democrat mailboxes\nAnd they're trying to blame Trump for it are you kidding me this will make people crawl on broken glass to vote Republican\nSo please keep it up guys please\nKeep it up [noise] we're in San Diego hey Sean Mark Davis into Larry how are you doing now ... good ... good thank you\nWant to call in and and respond to a couple of things they fought back and take get the loan let me try 'em but I thought you had a caller calling talking about he had two former ... military Katty\nUm we're we're looking to simply return to some semblance of human decency in manners\nGood luck you know\nAnd yeah but you know that sounds like a ... that seems like a pat answer let me add one tiny sentence [noise] there's no way we can wander\nBut there's no water we can have some sort of way we can what there is no legislation we can pass but we you know we can do the examples in our own lives\nBefore if we're conservatives into for the leftist around us let us never say anything worse about them than we think you're mistaken and explain why and invite conversation invite dialogue and and bring some some some biblical love to it some some godly affinity for your fellow man there's not enough of that let us be beacons for that in our own lives\nAnd that might be the best answer your question I Hope yeah Chris you appreciate you taking it thanks Tibet my we're in Cleveland hey nice to have a gym Mark Davis central area\nHow can you hear me okay I sure can oh okay I I Am always happy when you're one of the show and how she meant that I

Want bad things to happen to anybody but I Hope that there is a rebuke ... for for Democrat tactics I Hope some people but Republican 'cause they're conservative and they weren't Republicans to succeed\nAnd maybe some folks vote Republican just to deliver a message to the sorry sorry behavior of today's Democratic Party\nYeah well thanks for taking my call\nMy pleasure thank you appreciate

reason for that as a justice so discord is just to get us all\nHopped up and I don't know maybe maybe than any of the things we anything's possible\n... herself is urging me for that\nAnd I guess I'm trying to think I'm I'm\nI guess I'm trying to think of what exactly\nOkay well let's say with the Chinese let's say where the Russians and here we are in Moscow or Beijing and the point in which someone says okay let's have some of our operatives sand incendiary looking devices to key Democrats or what's in it for us how how does how does that help us\nLaws like putting a lot\nOf us so I mean no no I don't know how how does that help them you we're we're we're the Chinese and the Russians I put myself in their uh you know the bushes what what reason would they have what reason would they have for doing it\nTo get Democrats to know like military building or don't like things that Republicans tend to do a\nChart all okay I ... so he has to do that would be a reason this kind of real

music industry here some me history just for everybody in and around Jacksonville thirty six this crazy thirty six\nYears ago today [noise] um I sat down thoroughly it up to my first talk show ever on W O K v Jacksonville, Florida [noise] ah\nYou know they say Oh yes I Do [laughter] that was actually at the time\nSo many radio careers find a hundred and radio guys and many of them will probably tell you a story about how it ended up being fairly young and just being in the right place at the right time where somebody gives you an opportunity to do something you have absolutely no idea whether you can do it but you you show up you don't embarrass yourself for them\nAnd uh and look what happens to thirty six years later and most of the show holy\nCow so thanks thanks thanks Sarah everybody listening when we're here Sebastian Gorka is here tomorrow and I'm back on Monday before Larry's return\nOn um on Tuesday of next week I'm let's let's hit the reset top of the hour we sat on what we're doing the mystery packages\nI Am hearing a lot of skepticism about the preferred narrative of we have a conservative terrorist I'll believe we have a conservative terrorists when we have a conservative terrorists in handcuffs being arrested and fingerprinted till then I Am open to absolutely anything\nOr even Chuck Todd but it's kind of interesting\nEven Chuck Todd said today they're like uh how about the Russians some some and and you know one why not I don't know conservative terrorist Russians Democrat prankster or any of the ...\nAbsolutely no idea no idea\nOf misspellings and ineptitude if it is the Russians and the Russian government at some you know idiot Russian guy in his basement and you know Michigan or something I don't do so again the speculation games lovely parlor game you can play with your friends\nI have no idea and neither do you so it makes it a very bad idea to jump in and like we kind of know and that's that's that's the third level of of noxious best to all this presumption and miss this gold at the modern media culture has to lecture President Trump about his right arm\nWhen they call him a Hitler every day for lunch\nCome on man I'll take no lectures from CNN about civility and a a\n... and decency in a discourse party phone number is eight eight nine seven one stage so we we have no idea what's going on a package story let us lift up a prayer and every good wished for law enforcement and for the people who are working on this so that we can get the bottom of it and maybe see pie and find out what a and see if I Do what is what I'm going to tell you one thing\nYou can join me on this or not get a free country if they don't find a suspect like in in weeks and I mean because if it was just some moron terrorists who happens\nTo vote Republican or they're going to find him probably by the weekend so if they don't find anybody for a few days you're much skepticism is only going to grow but yet I Will reach no conclusion I Will jump to a to know bottom line of all of the game\nCome to me here's something I'm not going to lead come to me the caravan\nPresident Trump apparently in the same mood deploying a military secretary of defense James Mattis signing deployment orders [noise]\nAs we speak sense military down there I said for weeks that if if if this caravan gives the feeling they're about to get met by the United states military and I don't mean they're going to get you know rolled over by tanks or anything but um they may turn around and and think better of his\nLet me let me do this I've been sitting on this this new column\nNews written an opinion piece in um on Fox News today\nMigrant caravan on march what we must do it for women Caribbean arrives at our border ready here we go\n[noise] the caravan of an estimated seven thousand Central American invaders trekking through Mexico toward the United states is roughly one thousand miles from the nearest point of entry a second group of roughly one thousand is also seeking to join them\nThey may still be weeks away from our border but this leaves little time for President Trump\nCongress and all Americans who care about our national sovereignty and the rule of law to solve three incredibly pressing challenges\nFirst we must determine and do what we can right now to end this invasion before it reaches our doorstep\nSecond we must develop and execute a cohesive efficient effective plan for preventing these invaders from illegally crossing our border and force swiftly deporting those who are successful\nAnd finally we must fix the debilitating leaf stupid amalgam of immigration laws policies and court rulings that enable and encourage migrants to band together and stage these types of illegal invasions\nShould we fail to solve any of these problems are already dysfunctional immigration system will be further cripple our relationship with Mexico and Central American neighbors can be severely damaged\nOur border will be overwhelmed by droves of new migrants and America will become significantly less safe\nIf is Tara man is allowed to get through the end of the U.S the next caravan will be even bigger the one following that will be enormous according to the Gallup world gold twenty nine percent of people who wants to migrate from Latin America the Caribbean want to make the United states they're permanent home\nThat is thirty seven million people want to come here we must demand and ensure that they do so legally\nThe clearest answer to a leading this issue while the caravan is still in Mexico is for Mexico to stop it\nPresident Trump is already made clear that securing the border is more important than our recent trade agreements with our southern neighbor Mexico should take him seriously\nMany of the members of this caravan forced their way through the Guatemala Mexico border they're already in violation of Mexican law Mexican law enforcement should take action\nFurthermore we should not underestimate the degree to which human traffickers and transnational criminal gangs such as that has Thirteen and other cartels are involved with this invasion force\nMexican authorities should also be seeking to weed these elements out of the caravan and dealing with those who may have legitimate asylum claims through the Mexicans system\nMexican neighbors must understand that while they did not assertively deal with this problem at their southern border they will own the problem if it gets to their northern border this relates to what we must do it for when the Caribbean is allowed to arrive at the U.S border\nPresident Trump should instruct attorney general Jeff Sessions to issue a clarification to define the qualifications for asylum asylum is meant to provide protection for people who are fleeing real persecution and human rights abuses such as genocide simply being from a poor country that lacks opportunities does not\nQualify someone for asylum\nWe already have approximately seven hundred and fifty thousand backlogs asylum cases\nThese invaders should be screened preferably in Mexico so they never entered the U.S system federal government should also immediately begin coordinating with local and state governments along the border to develop an organized completely non violent system that can deter these migrants from crossing into the United states\nI Know Texas already worked with federal officials to prepare for mass migration events other border states should follow suit we must overwhelming invaders stopped them in their tracks and quickly return them to their home countries\nGo through a New Mexico Arizona California Washington Oregon and route and cross over into Canada and just let them have\nTo first do you have a sanctuary states and then deposit them in somebody else's bad Garrett [noise] yeah uh it's it's a very strange man thank you even as it is kinda funny everybody's area all the creative things will get the care of and lift ship 'em to Iraq okay there's that a\n... to ... and I had a satisfying as can be\nA to bring them into America and perhaps deposit them but at the door steps of liberal politicians who are thrilled that they are here you know it's really hard to actually have the most house guests but the best idea new had it right in that Fox News opinion piece the best ideas to prevent them from coming in\nAt all [noise] caravan talk scary package talk Megan Kelly upcoming midterms you pick it we're glad to have you uh eight eight nine seven one said we are in Cleveland Steve hey Mark Davis in for Larry how are you doing\n[noise] good I called about the suspect you yeah [noise]\nSo [noise] they have for a childish attempt and they look at you and all cause to pronounce your name couldn't and I wouldn't be an issue\nThat we could eliminate the one kid\nWasn't yes I suppose we again yet but you know but but you know the Unabomber case is interesting because he was ship and stuff to people and they didn't find him for years so I Am I'm fairly confident I guess I'm confident in law enforcement most things like this that\nThey start out as absurd mysteries and then you turn your head and the day or two or three or four later they gotta suspects like wow how did you guys do that they're miracle workers it's incredible but they'll tell you it's not miracles as hard solid police work and diligence in work ethic\nAnd God Bless them and um I ... I Hope we can get a few things settled here by finding a suspect a\nPretty soon we are in Anderson a South Carolina hey Sean Mark Davis in for Larry how are you doing [noise]\nDo you want to work and you know one of my car was\nAt the moment I looked at like bomb issue what lie to me every time you see those minority or\nAt least college campuses where someone spray paint a common negative and then it turns out to be the exact victim that a claim your ... you know the climate that we're that does happen to them or\n... or or\nThe you know what I'm Talking about we're we're one of the ah the air force academy high school there and the the the head guy they're delivered this impassioned thing it was beautiful it was it was very gripping a\nAbout we don't tolerate that that doesn't speak for us so we have to rise above this and it was a lovely lovely thought a lovely lovely speech\nIn the entire thing was a scam some kids that it so that everybody there are so many people are angry that that I mean and and so so what I put this past them I Would not not in this would be typical it would be completely in character you getting nothing is beneath them\nBut does that mean that I somehow do they do this or or even have an active leaning toward ed no I'm saying a wide open I recommend everybody do the same let the\nThe the law enforcement folks do their work\nAt some point we will have a suspect and then we'll know a lot more about what we're talking about here so to talk about some more stuff coming up our Davis's Larry Elder follow the ad Mark Davis on Twitter eight

M. A. O. F. am uh in the forty four hundred block of gender first street northwest were evacuated police said [noise]\n... said several nearby streets were closed as well\nW. M. A. L. as in the news and talk station known for its conservative syndicated programming such as Rush Limbaugh show\nOf course it has our show as well in addition to its FM service it also break ... broadcasts on six thirty AM no further information was immediately available but the suspicious package at the station where there was connected to this week's discovery of explosives center prominent mostly political figures across the country\nSo we don't know I don't know\nOh this is serious\nFrom my I'm reading\nThis as I got it I wrote my buddy Larry O'Connor who fills in for me now and then in the handles the local Sean WMA out says here\nAnd he was broadcasting at the time and they had to go to a best stuff as they evacuated the building say we had a suspicious package delivered to us your name was on the label by the way I guess mine\nA police recall they ordered an immediate evacuation ends up a false alarm okay false alarm I don't know what all this from it except my name is on the package\nAs to produce it use up my name was on the package to how to do that\nYou get what now\nYou get worried about the mail there [noise]\nWhat we do get our threats don't we [noise] and I wanted to talk about that briefly out about me uh but\nKind of what takes place in terms of other country in these various threats that have taken place and so forth and [noise]\nAnd I wanted to point this out we have these packages and we'll get more into them in a moment we have these packages going on now ten of them to various Democrats\nAnd law enforcement politicians to meeting the American people have every right to be concerned and outrage every right it's rational right to be concerned about this is a bad thing and it is a bad thing\nBut I went back and looked in the recent few months\nAnd ABC News reported just a few weeks ago suspicious letters sent a Republican Senator Susan Collins is home author said it contained rice and\nAnother one ... to ... the secretary of defense and the chief of 'em have been navy they tested positive for rice and Eric Trump\nSaying the entire family has receive white powder in the mail I was in August\nWhen there's others\nMarco Rubio can't remember them all\nIt's just hard to to to ignore the fact that all these examples I gave you before\nIt ... wasn't that they were downplayed was that they weren't really covered in any several why were they\nAll these packages going to the Trump family all these packages going to the Pentagon Madison so forth to Rubio or other members here and they're\nNot that I'm not trying to make anything of this\nI'm just saying\nThe coverage was different the coverage of what happened is Susan Collins was different wasn't a minister producing\n... there was no panic mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump for the Internet like 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of these things\nThe president who sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\n\nSo there's something out about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said I told you yesterday that I could see and together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking Trump\nFor what's taking place and now it's fully open\nIt's fully open that Trump's words and Trump's rallies and Trump's tweets are encouraging the sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first out of the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things in the present us\nThan any politician us\nNational Public radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I Would submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute anyway I just spent an hour talking about it\nYou can download it she can do your little cherry picking in your set up shop and I don't really know why there is a National Public radio it's unnecessary we have thousands of radio stations scores of radio companies why do we need a government run radio company when hosts are overpaid and they have no ratings\nThey don't live by ratings or die by ratings like anybody else you know competition for them it's government radio whatever government radio in a free society for but anyway\n\nSo we have these rice and attacks against Republican senators Susan Collins right after she voted for Kevin no other threats\nPositive for rice and sent to Madison the or the the chief of the navy center the president of the United states white powder scent of members of the president's family I really do not remember CNN getting all worked up about white powder being sent to the president's family does anybody else\nNow why does all lives matter it matters because the media are out there trying to determine\nWho politically should benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damage thing it's the most grotesque good\nAnd of course if Trump Trump's to blame But Trump's not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything now\nI Want to um play a montage for you on this pathetic program on MSL as the the morning show and Mr ... you're going to make it but you're also going to hear a never Trump or probably denies he's never trapper John ...\n\nYou're going to hear him a couple of times you also hear Steve Rattner Susan do per CEO whoever the hell that is John Heilemann Hi Adam in higher and higher in any way a\n\nAnd I want you to listen to this because it is it is really appalling what takes place on this so called network cut five go\nBut I Am now in my heart that President trauma there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric laid off\nAnd now that of all [noise] Tyler Pratt in the navy I Would have been targeted this is an unusual set of ... go ahead\nOf the reasons that it is fair to blame in some sense the president's rhetoric or less how I started out okay\nSounds fair in some sense what sense pot or it's\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot\nOr like Jay more on that in some sense ... you know let me ask you Jay pod of you guys ever commentary but much about the repeated references to the president and Hitler I Would think that would offend you does that offend you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner go ahead\nAnd costs us I think when you have a right or if it were kind of rhetoric we've had this guy over and over again\nAnd it is called the ... the enemy has cable and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten moms I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nSay if you have to tell your mother in law [noise]\nThem into WMA I was actually from a listener regardless [noise] and it had many names and mark Chris Larry merry the only one who wasn't on there was a buddy events so of course we became suspicious about since I'm just kidding [noise]\nAnd apparently had a the contents a piece of the Berlin Wall or something so it's a false alarm\nJohn King\nHe's supposed to be a news guy right journalist so forth believe he used to work for a pay or something is over at CNN which of course a launch his career he was on CNN Today and he said this had\nTo news busters cut for go\nNo one's planning the wedding the president\nOf the president wants to make this about him I'm a manager of the president for what he said yesterday\nOh president wants to make it about him cut five again MSNBC go\nPlay here now in my heart that President trauma bears a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that
