{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "That show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary [laughter] it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women who were studied and they found that the number one and a non combat reason that people died in the navy was due to the melanoma\nSo skin cancer so I'm reading in the study you know I I kinda pot is right there I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of ships in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful\nYou know you're young or a ... and they're developing skin\nCancer but then I read on and I\nSaid most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers in inside and I went home it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a closet thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility say you start to stiffen up and you feel\nAt night especially if you're in bad role in from side to side you wake up with your knees are hurting your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this in a setting in the church share with the lack of vitamin D three\nMy formula so here's someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball and pain muscle pain fibromyalgia I Would say on my formula like immediately and start thinking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day\nFor the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that seem good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax and my thing it's not what you can talk to your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while here core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like a little bit younger crashed\nAnd who wouldn't want that way and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results to be seen\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and his blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body\nFor rapid result in by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offer that's only available to you listeners today so when you do call pleased to be sure to mention this program and you're going to get a risk free trial\nOf Dr ... says vitamin D three again this is only available to your listeners\nAnd only a few cold this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nPlus if you'd call right now you also qualified to receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend\nBut you must call right now because this special radio offer is not available in stores or on line so that number to call is one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nAnd keep in mind folks you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr ... says vitamin D three formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back\nAnd when you do call and order you're not going to be enrolled in one of those automatic monthly subscription programs this is a one time order so I encourage you the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nSo how about if folks to me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the rights warm or enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is\nWhy we have so many of these health concerns you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf the formula is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D to vitamin D three and the two is the title of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three\n... three is the activated form so it's ready to go to work now the bottom of the three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab or the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is it going and going up and out through the roof where should be\nWhile so Dr ...\nAnd who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kid development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties so I you know you start and more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your car on the Cape yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start feeling that you can't golf you can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over the I just wish that every senior citizen and go on a formula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done\nAnd re clarity you know this is the more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr ... such that your fast melt do three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath on in the morning and then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of the vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like this and the sooner you can get on my formula better you're going to have of having a really\nHealthy high energy high mobility life from here on out\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and documenting what can someone expect when they start taking your fast melt the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first several days that it's changing your body because the kick start so many different cycles and your body that you'll start having less chain\nHaving more energy and having that are meant so clarity better sleep your mood can be affected by this vitamin D three is necessary to get these things run\nWell Dr biggest unfortunately we only have a few minutes left anything else you want to share with her audience here in our final minutes\nFor those of you listening covered a lot of our own working with the body is tricky as you know and\nThey weren't talking to your listeners have your show you know there are all walks of life but all various conditions and so I'm trying to get some good health that vice chair for at some point it doesn't get yourself out of it get yourself on its formula and see for yourself\nAgainst the law for you to try something worse that's an interesting thought we were talking about nutrition we're not talking about rocket science or write a lot of science behind what I'm Talking about\nThe key is to get on a formula given a month or two every day take one of the Senate and start the improvements and you're paying your blood pressure your blood sugar energy or sleep out of this is my appeal to your listeners to get on its formula to try it for themselves\nOr when we see the markets are down twelve hundred points between Wednesday and Thursday\nUm when you know we think about this and we we say well that's quite a bit of a drop yeah it was about a five percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average and the other indexes the NASDAQ and he has to be five hundred\nA that's not uh the worst we've ever seen however it's shocking when we see drops like that\nBut again our weekly economic update we do certainly give you a what's happening or as I mentioned over the past week so the obviously the weekly economic update this next coming which would be this Monday we'll talk a little bit about what occurred last week\nAs well as uh what his upcoming I'm moving forward\nAnd again you can sign up for that at our website at Grand canyon planning dot com\nAnd just grow to the bottom and there's a little uh area for you to type in your email address and will drop that righty each and every week now part of that you're going to get some information we talk about some weekly tips financial tests we talked about the rental that we do each and every week\nUh hopefully you guys find them it'll be cute and humor is funny a challenging whatever it may be or maybe a little corny at times I think some of these metals are little corny I don't make them up I Will tell you but uh\nUh I Do uh go to them each and every week I should try to maybe have a little more important to some of these but that's OK and of course this past week while the stock market was dropping\nLike a lead balloon we saw hurricane Michael which was dropping on Florida a and hitting as one of the largest storms we've had in the U.S history and that was I think it was the third strongest storm to hit the U.S\nAnd of course our thoughts and prayers go out with all of the people who are affected by that on Wednesday which was a pretty amazing a storm are now also a Nikki Haley\nResigned as us are UN ambassador\nAnd will be joining the private sector as of the end of two thousand and Eighteen and never had been some talk about her resigning\nAh and I heard her speech um when she talked about why she was resigning and I think it kinda made sense could you imagine a running a a state as a governor and going through all of the challenges that you face as the governor of a state\nWhether it's a she talked about hurricanes she talked about school shootings she talked about all of the other major issues that are faced with as a governor and the stress of that type of position and then to become the UN ambassador of our great nation the United states of America\nAnd for her to be doing that for two years so back to back a total of eight years of service that she's given to this country and she said you know what I think I'm about ready for a little bit of a break\nAnd I think we could all appreciate that those of us who are out there working hard every day fighting the fight trying to make ends meet and trying to do the right thing out there for our sales for our family for our loved ones for a church and for all of the people out there that we're trying to\nHelp 'em that sometimes you know what we just feel it's time you know and me with a lot of people who are thinking for them it's time to retire so I think we have to give her credit for making this decision and she uh you know one of the thoughts was Jewish people were trying to speculate well maybe she's going to run for president\nBashir reassured everyone that that that's not her goal that she would be supporting President Trump if he decided to run for another term\nBut she said she would not be running for office at least that's not in the short term plans for her at the moment\nSo with all of these things happening ... this week uh it was a busy week out there I Want to talk a little bit about um last week's read all real quick and then we're going to get into the meat and potatoes are some things here\nUh you know last week I read a rental it said the more you take the more you leave behind what am I the more you take the more you leave behind what am I and the answer is foot steps right so the more you take the more you leave behind footsteps\nAnd this week's rental what rock group has four members\nBut neither of them saying what rock group has four members but neither of them saying so think about that one folks and again if you want to get that a weekly or read all\nThe answer to it each and every week and you're Monday morning email you can do that by signing up for the weekly economic update at Grand canyon planning dot com\nI folks are always I encourage you to if you haven't been to our website I'm right on the front page of our website there's a video and it's an introduction to who we are as a financial planning for him I encourage you to just click on that and watch it\nAnd it'll give you some good insight to has as to who we are as a firm so that when you do schedule your appointment to come in and sit down and talk with me about what you're doing to plan for your financial future well you know kind of have a little bit of an insight and a feel for our firm and feel like you've already been here by just watching that little video All right\nUm okay so as I mentioned the market's dropped it drastically or this week it was it was a scary time I think for people when you think about\nThe markets as they climb over time so we if we think about the most recent poll back that we had similar to this I think you could go back uh not too far and too long ago and that was back out right at the end of January of this year\nIn early February we saw the market to take a really big pull back then about ... percent pull back\nAnd a lot of people were concerned at that time as well or as I can understand you know I always say you know money it's easy for me to say or for anyone to say hey don't worry about it it's going to come back right well it's your money and of course you worry about it it's it's an emotional to you it's important to you\nAnd you know you get up every day and go to work in and do the things you need to do to support your family and none of us like to open up our statements or look at our account on line and and see red\nOr they're in our column that we should you know we'd want to see green\nA so it it is a nerve wracking it's scary and when we see a drop as drastic as we did on Wednesday and then ultimately again not quite as bad on Thursday or we do\nKind of think back and it brings back memories of even a two thousand seven and eight when we had the major financial crisis but\nI think if you are at all watching or listening to what's happening out there and and understanding what's going on in the economy today we are in a totally different place today than we were\nTen years ago so this is my opinion as a financial professional I don't believe we're going to see that type of a major correction now can we still see a considerable drop from here or potential drop from here yeah there could be some additional pull back at this point\nBut I I Do believe we started to see\nA again Thursday even though we had a a you know the negative day in friday or we we started to see some buying occurring and we started to see a little bit more of that\nA bouncing you know off the bottoms and that's what we try to look for when we're trying to understand when we're close to a\nYou know a bottom of a correction\nAre we fully there yet possibly possibly not\nUh we're just going to have to wait and see over the next few weeks but we have to think about moving forward here or if you're a contributing to your four O. one K. folks and you're getting paid every two weeks on a friday or whatever that day is that you get your paycheck\nAnd a portion of that paycheck is a hazard deduction attached to it which is going into your four O. one K. well all of a sudden you've got a position to where you are actually going to be I'm buying into the market at a lower level which is good for your overall average\nRight there's the music folks who are going to

value and by the company buying that stock retiring that stock there actually limiting the number of\nShare but like some big tech companies will do this like Apple's done this and others have done this in part because they want you they want to lessen the amount of shares that are out there probably floated right while at the same time still being able to give share so their employees and they got increasing the total that the total amount of sharing surveillance\nControl of that and one of the things Jonathan that was good about lower interest rates this is where this little uh issue with higher interest rates can affect the company says well if a apple wanted to buy ... shares or any company wanted to buy back\nTo their own shares oftentimes they don't even use their own money to do that how they get a loan they get a loan they borrow that money or or they'll float bonds\nOr to the public that the public can buy that and they would have to pay interest but they're buying those shares with that money at low interest rates but as interest rates creep up folks this is where companies are going to have a larger expense internally\nAre also with wages as we see wages going up over the past couple of years\nUh this is inflationary and that also as we know corporate\nUh expenses are wages are one of the largest expenses that any company has and that is going to add to their expensive these types of things start to nibble into the growth of companies and expenses and the net income begins to drop that could be a challenge for some company so it's important folks\nAs you're buying individual stocks if you are\nThat your understanding what's happening internally with these companies not just buying them for their momentum but buying them for what is the long term you know really playing with this company what are they doing a good turnout elites\nIt's good leadership and having good leadership and I know there's a stock you and I both really like I won't say the name but there's a stock you and I both really like and\nWe liked the fundamentals we like the business plan with the potential in the future\nBut it also has it also comes down to like the c._e._o. like the CEOs vision and you're like the way the CEOs executing division ... men so I think that's important right so it's not just you liked the momentum of the stocks\nBut fundamentally you say this company has good management right and they have a good product that we feel there's growth for that will that will be able to grow in the future despite all these other headwinds right 'cause every company always deals with these headwinds and other than a side note\nAll companies are going to deal with rising wages because by the way we were in a situation which we just didn't rise for a long time I pronounce them seven we just didn't rise and so it's not just catching up\nRight and that's a good thing we all great but that is inflationary so that is worth our debt for Russia has a little challenging this is why it's important that uh the fed is is working closely watching closely will they raise red again in December don't know but they're scheduled to do so and they may\nSay play if you have you hang over John Ascher on what I Want to talk about too if you Jonathan has ownership\nOf assets this is important folks for those of you out there who own real estate or any any

matter\n[noise]\nAll right so ... you hear the word out well and I wanted to\nBring this segment in I Want to talk a little bit about something that oftentimes is overlooked [noise] when it comes to ownership so whether you have a bank account whether you have an investment account whether you have a piece of real estate a or a car any thing that has\nA title to it right folks to think of it this way I own a television but you know what a television is personal property it doesn't have a title to it if I Want to sell my TV to someone I can sell it to anybody I Want I could give it to anybody I Want and I don't have to\nSign a piece of paper that's transferring that ownership now I could if I Want to do some type of a bill of sale for personal property and I can say I\nUh agreed to sell this television set to this person for this price and I could write the check number that the person gave me or they paid me cash or whatever and that's just an agreement between the two of us so in case there's any\nEver an issue of whether or not I sold the TV to someone I Would have proof of that so that's always good to have\nBut I'm Talking about ownership of an asset that absolutely cannot be transferred unless there's a change to some type of a title on it whether it's a deed for real estate a certificate of title for your automobile or a bank account whatever it is it actually has an ownership a title to it and for that\nPurpose I'm going to bring on estate planning attorney Jonathan months with us today hey Jonathan how are you hey John how are you oh pretty good boy you got to get that ... has that better a little bit better guy like that better hey Johnathan uh she heard me talk a little bit about uh this whole idea of transfer of ownership\nOr depending on what the acid is and how those things have to happen and uh the reason and bringing this up is because I really want to talk about real estate but ... why don't you give us a quick synopsis about what I just said either confirm or deny\nA that what I said has any truth or a or not to it\nSo the way that you can own things right right on it together as tenants in common anything right means we each have an interest in it typically a fifty fifty interest in fact could be a sixty forty it simply means that I owned sixty percent of it and I can do whatever I Want with it\n[laughter] Patriot Act tip number

I Would I be better than\nSix dollars of Jane that's an old song I think I'm probably more like I Need a hundred dollars a year they pose with inflation was from the sixties [laughter] dollar just doesn't even know who their food as a\n[noise] the Alamo of black\nIs the er at an old one I don't know I just kind of ... that I don't know if you've ever had that on now I got\nThat one out there somewhere so are are always looking for fun different music but I Need I Need a dollar two cars and then go buy a lottery ticket Mm [laughter] it was for all these kids go to dream to you [laughter]\nYou know Chris talking about the lottery that's not a probably a good way to a plan your retirement ... that you're going to win the lottery now but but could you imagine win the lottery but it almost be a burden if you want like a five hundred million dollars what do you deal with it a John I'll take that chance what I'll take that chance I I have a plan\nYou do I have a plan you have a plan for that I have a plan for how are you buying tickets or actually I Do\nYou do I do every every once you're regularly very regular we'll have you ever won anything one two thousand dollars wow I Want eleven hundred dollar what'd you do with it or just rolled it right back into the laws that factory blend in five hundred million to ... thousand maybe next time I'll wind ten thousand oh my gosh you know I gave\nMy I'll show you know I brought it home gave my wife some of it and do my children's um and I was a little bit of donations things like that so yeah so if you want five hundred million what would you do you know I think about forty percent to forty five percent goes to taxes like ... I Would take the lump sum yeah\nAbout two hundred and twenty five million dollars I'd buy a bunch of municipal bonds is where I Know that I have my income tax free by\nA very large chunk of property mhm up north\nBuild a beautiful cabin on it mhm do a lot of travel I'd like to do a lot of charitable work ... with that uh I don't even know necessarily mean setting up a foundation you always hear about these\nSports figures over my foundation ground Asian I kinda find that eventually you're splitting up the pie too much so I think I Would focus on what I Believe our quality charity or whoever they do a good job right now just help fund them with their work\nVery good I hadn't thought about what I Do question because you know when I play lottery well you know I Do very rarely right we once in a while you know someone says hey I'm going to buy a ticket symptom five hundred million you want to sure I get my couple of bucks right into my money but uh yeah I I don't that's not something that I ever count on and I haven't thought about it because I don't think it's gonna ever happened to me because I'm not trying\nNow and the other side of things if we think about\nHealth care and the cost of health care one of the things when I find people come to us about I'm retiring there they're thinking hey I'm ready to retire now\nAnd I say okay how old are your number one right one of the age because we want to understand whether or not they're going to qualify for Social Security\nOr is that going to be part of the income or maybe they've got a pension but if they're under the age of sixty five we also have to consider healthcare as part of the expense that they're going to have to cover until they hit that age of sixty five so for those out there who want to retire early\nThis is certainly something that needs to be considered\nIt every day it's getting more and more important as far as the health care costs is your employer or are they giving you a buyout plant right and does that mean that they're also going to take care of your health insurance premiums as they had when you were a fulltime employee because as we all know healthcare is just becoming more and more expensive and\nGosh we've we've seen in a in the employment field as far as\nThe pay may not be so great but the health benefits are and people it it's that important that they're willing to take a little bit less per hour because the cost of health care\nHas gone through the roof so it's absolutely an important part of the plan right to get an idea how will you cover healthcare costs until you can jump onto a Medicare at age sixty five ... and it's just something that needs to be addressing a lot of people are just not thinking about that\nYeah and um if you're in that position where you're thinking about retiring early I'm One of the things is number one for you and your spouse you've got to consider that right in many ways spouses maybe your spouse is still working we're thinking of retirement maybe your spouse or still working maybe you're that's a great great thing I mean if that's\nThat's a situation where one of you wants to continue to work\nGreat maybe you could go on that plant\nAnd maybe there's a way to cover that cost maybe there's it's a it's a less expensive a way to go and certainly um you want to look at that research to see if that's that's an option\nUh and if not then you've got to maybe look at did you contribute to a health savings account right so if you're thinking about retiring maybe you're sixty and you're thinking of retiring\nOh maybe sixty two are sixty three you've got three years one of the things you might want to consider doing in most companies will allow you to do this it depending on the plan is contribute to a health savings account if you can contribute to a health savings account push for the next two three four years you might be able to build up enough in that health savings account\nTo cover the cost of the premiums for years up until the age of sixty five so it could be a a solution to this if you could plan a little ahead and the health to immune accounts it's a fantastic vehicle right\nAnd it gives you a lot of opportunities to save for your health on a tax free basis right you get through the ... mhm I don't want to play tax advisor from wherever it with my GPA or that it's it's tax deductible right and the nice thing is that it's meant for healthcare costs\nTo me and then if I Believe after the age of sixty five without health savings account can only be used just for health before that right after eight sixty five you can use it for anything\nRight you could actually draw down ... yeah of course there's going to attacks have all the way it works like an IRA very much so right so if you're getting to deduct it from your income even if you're contributing to an IRA if you're about fifty\nYou could put sixty five hundred dollars into that IRA or if you're contributing to your ...\nYear going to be able to also contribute to a health savings account and reduce your tax liability by doing so and as you mentioned Chris if you're using that money for health issues for health care costs than it's tax free you're able to use it but if you do decide at some point in the future to use it as some type of supplement to retirement or income\nYes you'll have to pay taxes on it just like an IRA so but that's okay I mean if you haven't used it for healthcare greatly tax at some point in time we know that yeah so very got All right Chris as far as preparation for the change I Want to talk about preparation for change of employment and this is something I see often more folks come in to us\nBecause they're changing their job and they want to know what their options are ... when it comes to their retirement accounts that they have\nAnd usually it's someone maybe who's fifty fifty five years old now they've been working with the company now for maybe ten Fifteen Years and all of a sudden there's a change maybe the the company that they're with\nIs downsizing maybe they're changing a focus on something and the team that they were working with is no longer going to be needed and what winds up happening is is they\nGet rest right mhm reduction in force and they get some type of a package possibly\nBut the thought is okay now that I have this what do I do from here we may have a four O. one K. we may have some stock options and we may have some other type of pension plan that's part of it is what do we do Chris how does it all has it'll work out at that point\nI think we are food before you make any decisions on anything I Would certainly asking an offer that opportunity to give us a call\nAnd let's sit down and let's take a review of well what are your job options out there are you looking for another job and maybe it's\nChris John derive a possibility of retiring right now we have to take a look at those things certainly were below that fifty nine and a half ... we don't want to necessarily go tapping into those IRAs there are ways to do it right where we don't pay penalties it's certainly a conversation that we can have\nOf how do we stretch you to getting Social Security but we're going to take a look at your four O. one K. apprehensions at\nCash mhm as well as health care and how are you going to maintain health insurance premiums et cetera so I I Would strongly suggested the first thing you do is give us a buzz right come on and bring everything in that shoe box John it and let's review\nAnd and see how our plan has changed\nRome burned in

much money [noise]\nUm [noise] he gave him ten thousand dollars too much so he went to prison for that [noise] and he did that during the Obama administration because he performed ... against Obama\nWell the truth of what he did now ... is a known in the end is conduct or speech inciting people\nTo rebel against the authority of a state or a monarch\n\nRabble rousing incitement to rebuild some version trouble making provocation cinnamon sport or rebellion insurrection mutiny insurgents civil disorder but on campus protesters were all charged with\nSid dish and sounds like the Democrat

George Soros\nNo I didn't know that that came out last week that is amazing\nI don't know for a hundred and Seventy five thousand a year I'd probably go do the same\nWell I could be a if I wasn't on camera a [laughter] anyways [noise] anyways um\nThe Bible has a son said something about sedition the Bible says the crime of creating a revolt disturbance or violence against a lawful

del anyways John you go a bit far sometimes and I don't think so I don't well let's look at it here's my defense of my statement is that\nThe Republicans don't always stick together now they going to stick together even if they have a full over a third of the Congress are they going to stick together or are they going to allow the Democrats to rule the day\nWell they seem to ruling yes I hear they're so ah I Hope\nThey don't that's why we need to get more\nRepublicans in office so so they can't well anyway Thomas Jefferson then let those X. expire when he came in John Adams was a one term president\nAnd [noise] ah\nThomas Jefferson was a two term president Thomas Jefferson was against the war with France\nAnd John Adams wanna that nets white past those because people were John ... and

Senate is a monster that much for ever disgrace it's parents John Adams [noise]\nTo talk about the jobs coming back I have some nominal numbers to share with you it's a unique number it's one that we don't hear about not about more people working something else\nWant to talk about Nikki Haley who I just saw last week right before her announcement a movie that's coming out this weekend that I really feel that you should see got a share of show well question idea I've come up with\nAnd\nLast but not least last but not least\nI Want to share something about early voting early voting and this was some a wise words from Alan in Corwin a great writer great speaker one of the better speakers out there on the surrogate and one of the I guess most knowledgeable men\nIn regards to our Second Amendment that you could imagine phenomenal speaker I'm\nThat's what we're going to cover on the show today before I dive into anything I've got to share a funny story [noise] funny story from last weekend during the confirmation hearings for judge Kavanaugh when they were voting when they were starting about when they were going to make the announcement\nOr somebody told me they were in the room\nWith the TV on and a crowd of people and they were about to make the announcements or soon to make the announcements and this person was talking still time before they're going to make the announcement but a lady next to her asked her if she could please be quiet she wanted to hear what was going on\nWhile the person who is speaking was about to say hey you know it's not going on yeah at this way she turns around and its Clarence\nThomas his wife [noise] so I I guess sometimes some people might have a little interest to see if they have a new co worker which only happens once every two three four years usually oh wow I thought that was rather amusing that story a A N kudos to the person for being able\nTo share it with me or you know what you can find humor in\nAny serious situation almost if you just hated it the right angle right\nI'll tell you it's not funny what is not funny to me I Wish I could find some humor in it and that's socialist Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez his comment that we should eliminate the electro college\nIs Sheena nuts yes\nShe is she's that or she is an idiot maybe both maybe absolutely both Alexandria here you\nAre listening we know she's a democratic socialist [laughter] I I'm not surprised but it's what she says and how she says it was really really has me once again up in arms but you know what we fight the shores we fight this\nEverywhere and anywhere if you care about your\nVoice than if you\nCare about your rights if you care about liberty\nYou need the electoral college\nNow ms Cortez is running in New York's fourteenth congressional district but she said over the weekend last weekend that the electoral college is a racist American relic that must be abolished\nAlexandra it's just the opposite is this is the voice of the individual this recognizes each and every one of our voices absolutely\nWithout question that's the beautiful thing it doesn't say one man one woman of any look color size shape intelligence\nIs given rights above another the rights need to be recognized created equal and treated equally now are we equal now\nAnd don't try to give me that whoa whoa cool this is not a coup by are you telling me on even my best say I would ever be able to defeat Michael Jordan and a game of basketball speaking about a broken leg and I could have been in my prime and I probably would've been able\nTo come on you know what I'm saying there's always going to be somebody smaller taller shorter fat or skinny or smarter dumber we're with a better voice\nBetter hair better complex than we\nAre treated equally does not mean we are necessarily equal at the end but Alexandria if you want to be to be treated equally if you want you always have a voice a voice\nA sovereign voice then you need to keep the electoral college she said that it's past time we eliminate the electoral college a shadow of slavery is power on America\nToday that undermines our nation as a Democratic Republic\nWow you got one thing right we are Democratic Republic most of the Democrats left his hand to Republicans\nSadly enough I think we're a democracy we are not a pure democracy folks\n\nWe are a Democratic Republic so your voice must be heard but there is individuality that is recognized\nIn the process in the process\n\nShe was commenting in reply to Julia I Can't even pronounce your last name but it starts with an ice so we're going to call you Julie an idiot who complained that the electoral college has helped conservatives get elected\nWe are a country where two presidents who both lost the popular vote have no place for justice is on the Supreme Court democracy in action\nUh yeah it is folks is democracy in action because our nation is split up into very unique states each with a different\nVoice that is going to be recognized why because we don't want to be considered fly over now look at the electoral college map look at the map of the\nPopular vote and the electoral college map folks\nDo you want to know where the popular vote was and Hillary did win it in this past election look at it look at it it will be all read except for\nOn the coasts\nSome of the cities you will see a lot of California mainly near Los Angeles you'll see a little bit of Phoenix you'll see a lot of Chicago you'll see a lot of New York city and their folks\nHillary Clinton won about fifty sixty Seventy counties in the whole of the United states of America with over three thousand counties and President Trump won over three thousand\nSomething odd about that isn't there folks something a little odd about that I don't think ms Cortez\nWho wants to get rid of the electoral college understands if you get rid of the individual voice the right of the person to have rights so to speak to\nBe able to protect themselves under mob rule you end up with Venezuela how's that working out\nHey my friend Joel can tell ya quite a different story ... communications director during my last campaign and he is from Venezuela he somebody who knows exactly what's happening there he's been there\nHe seen it he's worried about the lives of his family members trust me I have spoken to him\nAnd he also understands the beauty of a sovereign nation as he has served in combat as a combat medic in the U.S army and he lives with shrapnel on his hip as his\nRemembrance of serving our country well I remember all the time John I appreciate it and I I pray for all of you and your family [noise] that is in Venezuela and I do pray\nThat\nWiser minds prevail in the instance of those who would choose an electoral college for those of you that aren't familiar with it if we had a majority rule greater fraud\nWill be opened up\nYou'd have a greater federal government raiders centralized power easier easier to manipulate the votes because you know what if I were running for president where when I go where the masses are are you only need to go to about twenty stops across this nation and speak to those people\nIn the big cities talk about getting forgotten don't tell me that that Arizona doesn't matter don't tell me we're fly over don't tell me that\nI Want to live in Arizona I don't want to live in New Jersey anymore no problem with Jersey except for I didn't like the taxes\n\nAlexandria Cortez is the example of somebody wanting larger government\n\nShe wants to restructure our constitution\nShe wants a low threshold of votes in the presidential election cycle she wants\nGreater federal government bigger bigger government\nSpecial interest groups having a much easier time to control the people she wants to silence your voice she wants to silence they value she wants to silence the voice of the state\nThey believe that without the right to life maybe all of our other rights to cease to exist\nSo\nI Would love to hear back from everybody who go sees the gods now movie that's coming out\nDean Cain dean Cain from\nA Princeton University yeah\nNo I'd love to hear feedback from you folks ... everybody's opinion on that I'm planning on getting a ticking going out and seeing it this weekend her next or I'm going to price you to the theaters now because we get a good showing in the theaters it'll continue\nI like to hear both sides folks I really do I like to hear the argument for somebody that believes that\nWe should still have abortion I don't believe that\nI shared my stories on on the show before\nIt's not about a woman it's about life it's about the life of the individual it's about the right to life\nI've talked about it on the show quite a bit but right now I just want to encourage all of you to go to the gods now Murray check it out\nI'm just I'm amazing\nThe story I I've also heard during the filming of this movie there was a lot of problems where they had to relocate and change locations because people are canceling autumn but guess what I found out last week when speaking with some people\nJust the opposite also happen there were some places that opened their arms to the film crew of God's now and we're helping them assisting them in any way shape or form possible\nSo check out the movie let me know what you think about it and tell you what folks\n\nAre\n... don't go low don't go low don't get violent you're just going to piss people off when you get violent when you're trying to\nProtest somewhere dear friend of
