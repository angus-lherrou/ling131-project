this wrist worn personal alarm emits a piercing a hundred and thirty decimal Blair that can be heard from up to a thousand feet away\nNow the good thing is it's a poll ring not a button so it reduces the chance\nOf an additional an accidental trigger\nThat there's nothing worse than you know a loud noise while you're focused and having your meditation old type of me time run so the downside it's you know it's only effective in populated areas and you know it's not going to disable an attacker so\nYou know there's nothing no perfect fix yet but we're getting there so\nAs most of you probably know and going for a jog it's important to take the right gear with you once you ... you want to gather a few items to bring with you it might sound uncomfortable and you might have to get creative with how you do it but there is some essential you should always run with in the city such as\nId meaning driver's license you know um student ID passport et cetera you know passwords a little tougher to stuff into your pants but\nYou get the picture a permanent medical information some people have\nMedical uh bracelets you know your your um insurance card et cetera so those are important things as

is it lists all the most important information in one place for example it might list your name where you're from some emergency contact numbers and so on there also road IDs you can attach to your fitness trackers you don't have to wear an extra bracelet\nIt's not a bad idea to bring your phone with you like I said I mean I've use mine too far back when Iran one direction too far so\nYou know you may already do this you can listen to music I Do that and you can track you running but it may be a life cedar safer when you need to make an emergency call you could call the police if you felt like someone was following you\nCall an ambulance if you've been hurt or even call a friend to pick you up if you've been put if you push yourself a little bit too hard and if you don't want to bring

with can be a lot different than running in a quiet neighborhood on a or on the trail\n[noise] the scenery can be an obstacle and its own right and there are potential dangers that lurk literally around every corner\nNot to scare you but so fortunately you know how to navigate them running in the city can be a great way to stay in shape but here's some basics you always want to practice stay alert and keep your eyes open and up so you can spot any hazards around you\nThere is a designated jogging path or a sidewalk use it keep your distance from the curb or road as much as you can and

running and getting out there and walking\nIf when worst case if you need to get in that running routine so you also should plot the safest route possible\nWhether you're at home or on vacation or a business trip as I was saying there is a higher instances of\nRunners being attacked so it's important that you plan out every aspect of your run before you go instead of taking it off instead of taking off on a whim which is fun but you know it can be dangerous so\nLook for the danger spots in the city or in and they are unpopulated areas with poor visibility where someone could easily attack you like\nFrankly a roll of Ollie Anders here in Arizona is is at a desk or done a little dangerous you could have somebody jump jump out from their use Google Maps or running that tool to carpet

runners in the area and you're less likely to have have an issue so\nLocation though isn't the only thing that matters considered time the time of day you're going to run as I said for me you know it's very difficult in the summer here in Arizona to\nRun in the middle of the day so I go at desperate on like many of you and when there are fewer pedestrians walking around you have fewer obstacles\nTo dodge on the sidewalk um and so we get up really early you'll get fewer pedestrians\nSo you'll also breathing less car exhaust if there's less people out but you got to kind of balance
