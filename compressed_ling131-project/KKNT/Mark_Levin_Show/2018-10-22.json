recognize her really just to the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of uh the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nSo that is amazing and when I use is with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles and real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact or the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years of the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium museum in the system well very drugs that are training the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish and in many of them\nIs also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's it's really it's really a rat race or sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have

absolutely risk free so that number to call is one\nEight hundred eight two three eight eight five seven oh give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight two three eight eight five seven\nDay just tuned in we're talking with Dr Michael Pincus about stress and the negative effects that everyday stress has on your body whether it's job stress financial stress family stress any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... ... you were talking about how your ... formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress\nAnd I guess this is something everyone should be aware of whether you're twenty four or Ninety four\nI've used it for many many years as as a younger person and I'm Eighteen [laughter] so I use it then it definitely helps me sleep better it helps control the stress of the work in the world and many people just be amazed how this actually work\nBecause our formula have a chemical reaction occurred before you actually ingested mhm Mac is treated off it doesn't get lodged in your system and so what happens is that when people drink the Mac\nIt's like an infusion into your body is like like compress it and so people who aren't paying they take the comments the calcium and he didn't get into the muscles and it starts to relax it\nDr biggest you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you are to elaborate a little bit more on that subject if you would I mean the stress really affect our energy levels\nQuestion 'cause like the biggest thing right now like people chronic fatigue syndrome PMS fibromyalgia\nLike white people and that's the key to low energy is a lot of it's caught by paying feeling old your joints don't well it's kinda wife's you out it drains your energy and then and then you get tired and you go to sleep I guess what you don't\nKnow I'm telling you like common scenarios total lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the comics and the first thing that happened you take it twenty minutes before you go to bed mhm good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed energy coming back\nIs comic safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\nComics is never ever been shown to interact with any medication okay it's a hundred percent natural state and you know formula doesn't contain sugar\nWhich isn't a lot of calcium product wheat gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid doesn't have any of that but you see the point is is that if you're a person at a diabetic and high blood pressure you had a bypass surgery guess what\nYou are deficient you are deficient in the calcium and magnesium\n... unfortunately we're about out of time or any any parting thoughts I mean who who can really benefit from this\n[laughter] I Wish we had more time because this this product I'll tell you if you're over the age of thirty five [laughter] definitely be taking the comebacks formula\nJust daily preventative basis yeah but if you're someone who's more of a senior citizen or someone who can't sleep well or your experience do a lot of muscle cramps a lot of it can and your body this is an absolute it's so simple but it controls most every function and your whole body you're someone\nThat's been diagnosed with a condition your blood pressure medications always saying how Macs is so unique it's something that I urge you to try and help you\nTime you do it to me when you catch my program each weekday morning lives six AM and an east coast and on demand twenty four seven\nLearn more you you're a dot com\nNovember midterms are scarcely more than two weeks away\nMail in ballots are already blowing in early voting underway Congress was in the crosshairs of the electorate will Democrats get power back in the house and what about the Senate ... actually gain seats two three four several current democratic streets or in the spotlight\nGoes in North Dakota Indiana Florida but none more than Missouri is incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her variable challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project merit Josh\nThis time keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign we've got\nSome news biggest Claire McCaskill shots to respond to to our hidden camera investigation she attacked a video of course but she made a false statement in this state and she put out\nA she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II had fortunately embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct\nI had nothing to do with Josh ... never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved with this investigation\nAnd just for your listeners know our investigation McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that come up and McCaskill on a bottle policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that other staffers talking about banning semi automatic rifles and the capital herself was calling hidden camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be gun ban of some type so the capitals now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only does the Stanford talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talked about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets in the Senate will vote with the so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there is a red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not left is they're they're they're moderate\nThe pro life pro gun Democrats ... thing in Missouri indoor than me slaying state so whether it's an aspiration exposure is is that in order to get elected in order to get elected\nYou have to lie to the people and that's what our staffers are saying anything moderates we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because of the ball hitting\nUS Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling her a wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response James okay\nWell it is some startling and Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently in betting on me and my campaign\nNice the attorney general in the same as he starts to be going after fried not participating in it [noise]\nSo um there was nothing there I think very up prime al my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment really telling about this is how how far they're willing to go too far in bed somebody in my campaign\n[noise] world first of all it didn't mean to fly categorically unequivocally falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I'd never met him and she didn't live on a local TV in Missouri Larry to what's going to happen next to this this rather than a candidate John always going to tell you that had nothing to do with it\nChicken at respond to that so I think we're we're achieving our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nHurricane and ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable and that does now passing thirty\nAnd all air force base near Panama City took a serious\nAnd it's one of the size of or a leader deaf twenty two fighter jets which they were concerned with our nation's fighting ability ought to be concerned about that I turn to a regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher of the house armed services committee offense experts in the marine corps intelligence veteran himself let's\nGet right down to it the danger zone\nHas receded according to I'm writing a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr Mike Bost Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory [noise] it's it's we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and\nVery sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party offices we have around my district in northeast Wisconsin we've seen in a surge in volunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to take up signs and ask what can I Do to help so I Do sense a slight\nMomentous shift I always thought this was going to be a nice that when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other\nUh but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and other Democrats are pulling out\nOf a couple of states that look if you try to get our direction so again we got to run through that you have this you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down\nThe candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we're talking about here\n[laughter] sorry let me talk to you about some defense or she was first of all the F twenty to ten dull a it's a murky picture I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a things to sell technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way we keep as twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell you trying to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask questions of video deed figure out what exactly happened it seems like Seventeen twenty Jews are damaged I think ten of those are cats and the storm right at hangar\nBut no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the center of the Seventeen when Lester rated hangers\nI think it's important enough that no one thought this would be a four to five little working forty hours prior I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here on the planes are basic and do so that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want to budget that twenty two is going into super cruise over Kansas it's too disturbing to the local communities\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country so as best I can tell him talking to officials pocket experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired but the problem here is the skin on the plane\nThere's a lot of radar absorbent material wham involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive\nAnd my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frames appear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track but repairing the scans will be a very expensive proposition finally I just say coming to your question you know why we're so many their ground\nThis goes back really to the Obama administration decision to the program at two thousand nine factory gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that show many were on the ground and the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts and a lack\nOf train people to repair that\nOur president is doing the job camping when candidates

general change our debt [noise]\nAbraham Lincoln\nHe couldn't be Robert ... he was going crazy I don't know if you know the answer but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln gamma reason I can see\nThat one day\nIt was looking really mad and he just said\nYou hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem\nAnd I said I don't

at that point he said we don't have the ... the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday what are the second offends me six a sufficient to the United states\nWell the question here is has turkey shared intelligent Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe the radio of from inside the conflicts showing who did what a mix of the nation you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence got it buys who often work very closely with the Turks and that's one thing and if they haven't if they only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared\nReally All right now doesn't impact for example the war in Yemen this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront these were sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome as being a necessary course correction middle aged\nI'm not sure they had any impact on me and rainy and all that I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish tennis whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a robot operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nCan their arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it is an exotic story and read like a thriller ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long Democrat or a\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite

there are no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's gonna find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has

chances are you have found crayon marks on walls appliances not to mention TV screens\nFor those of you aunts and uncles out there who babysit your children or grandmothers and grandfathers who haven't had them in a while and suddenly you have an art gallery on your walls or your TV and pray on there is a simple way of removing crayon drawings from your screen simply use WD forty\nI never would have thought of this but applying WD forty two a towel and holding it against the screen surface instead of spraying it directly on the unit is what's the key here\nYou know here's some things that you can do at least as far as a dog goes the pet safe spray shield animal deterrent it it detracts animals with a powerful ... percent and it helps and aggressive dog unlike pepper spray it has

with bears you want to be as big as possible scare them off you know\nSo it's that same concept to be as noisy and as big as bright as possible to attract attention and scare off\nI'm your attacker whether it be two or four legged okay so\nNext I Want to mention something\nThe latest road trip which I Will be talking about next week on\nThis show I went to ... Texas with my family and I ended up doing a long road trip through New Orleans and going up through Vicksburg this was this was our little fall break trips so\nThat was we were supposed to fly out of Dallas and our flight got cancelled by Expedia\nSo as you can tell I Am non plus about that but I had to rent a car last minute due to the hurricanes it's hurricane season and all of the flights got booked so I had to rent a car to drive back to our beautiful state of Arizona\nAnd it was the last minute things so you know in my case and in many of yours you know we're all we're all out getting out there and and doing stuff and in order to be safe to do those things it's important to pack an emergency car kit\nAnd the reason for that is so many things can happen just keep it if you even if you're flying\nTake it in a suitcase because you don't know if you will be driving home like I did last Sunday [laughter] Seventeen hours straight with my parents and the children it was ... imagine [laughter]\nYou go from flat Texas through New Mexico when we cross that Arizona border it was a huge cheer you know but the point is is that you need to make sure that you've packed this cat so\nHere's what needs to happen I\nGo in and you you can build your cars emergency preparedness preparedness kid by packing blankets and extra clothing and shoes so if you're traveling\nLike I did you already have the clothing and shoes but you can pack a blanket that'll little pack down something potentially nylon\nOr um you know but that has a little bit of warm to it but it has a little bit of um [noise] not natural fibers cause they typically won't pack down is tight so\nI'm polyester does really well for warmth and you can add um\nProtein bars and a favorite snack um as long as it's packaged you can bring that on the plane they don't care but they do care about liquid so um you know when you're when you're stopping make sure that you get some water and\nPack that away with your cat as well and leave it in the car so you'll also want to make sure you have a first aid kit in your luggage or in your car and has stock to\nBandages antiseptic gods and other basics\nSo this last trip we did was ah through you know Gulf Coast area up in ... Mississippi Louisiana\nI Will tell you you know many nights we we we had to stuff toilet paper in our ears ... imagine sleeping trying to sleep and you hear it and\nSo I said kids go get the toilet paper\n... piece of the toilet paper in our ears so we can get some rest we woke up a little bit in up so I Would suggest as well in this kid making sure that you have either drier sheets to get rid of the you know the bugs and as well as you know\nWhat do you call that calamine lotion [laughter]\nBecause the local shops you know in in this area don't seem to notice you know either they're immune to bug bites\nBut it's not super easy to find unless there's just a random Walgreens around there so if you're going in the southern states of the United states of any sort I Would say calamine lotion should be in your emergency kit as well\nSo also you're going to make sure you have\nRoads layers and um you know things it it very frankly you should also be checking to make sure that you have a spare tire if that\nIf your vehicle will fit like a donut tire 'em in a in a changing tire kit um [noise] as well in the car so if you're a rental car doesn't have that you can ask the rental car company for a kid um you know because some of these places are so remote\nI really don't know how long it would take triple A.\nOr one of your toe companies to get there you may want to try to get into a station where you can get to a hotel get to somewhere where you can rest and you're not on the side of the road waiting for hours for until company potentially with all of the mosquitoes [noise] so\nUm you know all of these things are super super important so that you have a a nicer trip\nUh like I said I learned after the first evening of bugs or what to do so I Would just say you really want to try to pack some of these things ahead um\nYou know and make sure that they're in your bag and ready to go so you know your road trip is is much more streamlined and successful [noise]\nAll right so you also want to have a cell phone and a charge or seizing call for help and stay in touch with your family you might also considered keeping your kid and in a backpack and keeps you need to lose lead the car and so my kids travel with backpacks I travel with her so\nThat goes with their stuff all the bottles of calamine and gold bond medicated cream\nAll right so let's see here\nNow travel mistakes as I mentioned I have had a few the bug thing was was definitely one of them I was not prepared for that so\nI have done a lot of traveling and I feel like in many respects though I I have the system down and so whether by train or by car it's still easy to make some mistakes and we're all susceptible to it it can be anything from choosing a destination to packing navigating maps\nThere is a list of a few more of a common travel mistakes here and you know\nJust do what you can and have them as my parents put it were making memories [laughter] so [laughter]\nThat's what it's about and sometimes\nWhen you have the ... news it's it's fun to talk about ... and laugh about afterwards but not in the middle of it but here in some ways to avoid some of these mistakes so trying to fit to many destinations into one trip I have actually done that as well\nUm and we had one of the days where I had not planned for the size of the drive a that we had\nSo we didn't get to do as much in the city that I had planned for and it's the there are travelers who actually have attempted to visit ten cities on a two week vacation to Europe\nIt sounds like fun but in theory it doesn't give you much time in each city as I mentioned before you get there you look around everybody get back in the car so there's a certain amount of time you'll spend flying or traveling on it in a car on a train\nAnd so the best thing to do is map out what your trip priorities are read opinions from other travelers about the minimum amount of recommended\nA time needed per city and planned rest days to alleviate the stress and get the Mossad they experience without being exhausted\nRemember you can always return if you don't fit it all in\nAnother little tiny tip what this is you know when you're doing a road trip that you're going to have a couple of long drives bring the neck pillows that you would bring on a plane because for the non drivers the if what is that the law of the carpets everybody to sleep and you don't want to wake up at the quick and your neck\nSo that helps as well so standing in long lines\nAt attractions is another aspect of a ... of a mistake you know you might be entertained and museum or Parker seeing such sites as the Eiffel Tower but waiting in line\nHas been ready to DC for politically correct I tend to dismiss learn the Larry Elder [noise]\n\nLarry over here that said from South syndrome unit bizarre\nWay down the Marines are welcome to the program because we got to kind of just a guaranteed\n[noise]\nCrippled eight nine seven one S.
