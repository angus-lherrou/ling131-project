Bush being called a racist that's why I'm actually one is called George Herbert Walker Bush racist that's why the left calls Donald Trump or racist\nWho's going to vote for racist racist\nNow it might be persuasive if they didn't do it all the time\n\nWhat did William clay and a member of the house say about Ronald Reagan when he was running Ronald Reagan got his racist precepts from mine cop are you kidding me\n\nJulian Bond the head of the ... in double ACP said that George W.

the majority of Democrats according to a poll I recently read majority of Democrats believe not only that the Russians interfered but they they changed ... vote tallies\n\nAnd there is zero evidence zero that vote tally were changed Obama's homeland security director Jay Johnson said there was no evidence whatsoever that any voting tallies changed not if the majority of Democrats believe it how

here in DC they start to sound history on a a ... and it's all a reason to sort of try to inspire their base I suppose to step forward if not the most important election of your lifetime [noise]\nUh but but it's important for the next two years because of the Democrats do when the majority in the house we're looking at obstruction even more so than what you're saying we're looking at the resistance movement holding the gavel\nIn the speaker's chair and in ... chairman share of every single committee [noise] you're looking at impeachment you're living in investigations\nFor as far as the eye can see you're looking and investigations of the Trump Administration and the Republican Party and conservatives in this country in general I and if you don't believe me if you think I'm speaking in hyperbole listen for a moment to one of the shining lights of the Democratic party probably this guy's going to be a running for president\nOr he is on the intelligence committee he's Joaquin Castro he's a congressman he's a Democrat he's on the intel committee\nWhich means the Democrats taken very seriously I just this used to be a committee that that you know transcended party it was about the most important sensitive information that this country or could ever waded into\nA ... that that it it shows no politics there's no red there's no blue there's just red white and blue on the intelligence committee or and then the Democrats brought us Adam Schiff the ranking member\nAnd uh this guy Joaquin Castro of Texas who who claims to be and they say of him that he is presidential material he was on Hillary Clinton short list for vice president this guy\nI came on CNN earlier this morning and made up of himself\nAnd committed what is tantamount to if not defamation of character\nAt the very least one of the most irresponsible things I've ever heard of politicians say about another government official and that's saying something speaking about the current situation in Saudi Arabia\nI no problem with this with a lot of that sort of out of a more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today let me get to the point that I think is the most conservative right now the recording the jury for sure [noise] may have with U.S intelligence civil liberties ... enemies with [noise]\nThe crown prince and the Saudi Arabia ... that may have acted on that one of the people that he took action again [noise] Mr conservative and they're not right away\nTo find me clarify army or we do not have that recording I'm not sure where you're getting out of recording to that effect [noise] or like World War II and without a factor sure\nNow here's where you have to understand why this matters more than just you know some sort of gas for some sort of outrage the outrage of the day and Democrats accusing Jerry cushion or of ... hit on this guy and working in concert colluding if you will with the Saudi Arabian government and the crown prince [noise]\nAh that's certainly all valid untrue but here's the most important thing you need\nTo understand about this he's one of their stars the Democrats win the house two and a half weeks from today and he is in the leadership\nI mean he's he's he's a rising star ... they're going to give him power more power than he has right now this guy who was peddling a conspiracy theory that it's completely debunked unfounded and atrocious he goes on CNN in turn national television\nAnd accuses Jared Kushner the president's son in law and a White House advisor\nOf delivering U.S intelligence to Saudi Arabia so that this is a columnist or cut shockey could be killed\nAnd and they're going to give him power now this\nMay not be the most important election of your lifetime but if you care about the direction of our country for the next two years if you care about anything positive getting done if you care if if you are sick and tired and set up\nOf the ongoing drama that you see play out and cable and broadcast news on a daily basis with regard to the Democrats\nAre acting hysterical about this president and about this administration than this is a no brainer\nThis really is a no brainer you cannot give Joaquin Castro [noise]\nAny more power than he already has in the house of representatives frankly has too much as it is\nAs a junior congressman from Texas He shouldn't be on that committee with that kind of irresponsible behavior with that kind of irresponsible language by the way he came out later this is this is amazing he came out later and said I didn't intend\nTo a accused Jared Kushner\nOf any illegal behavior I did in tend to accused you're a cushion or could you\nMay have with U.S intelligence is the ... with the enemies with [noise]\nThe ground and the Saudi Arabia print that may have acted on that one of the people that he took action again [noise]\nI think he did you hear what do you just said and now he claims after the fact via Twitter\nIs how they do it these days but I didn't I didn't intend to accuse cheering cushion or\nOf calling a hit or doing anything on toward a delivery misinformation scares the problem with these Twitter denials these cowards who will go on television he's fine going on the international television on CNN and making this charge\nThe recording the jury cursor\nMay have with U.S intelligence for the ... with the enemies with\nGround for it and the Saudi Arabia\n[noise] he goes on international TV and delivers that and then when everyone starts screaming ... and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the\nDaily Beast website which is which is a new left leaning left complete total left the site\nSays I Can't believe that walking captured it that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no no no no he puts out his apology non apology denial non denial walk back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner blah blah blah blah blah and of course there is no reporter not that there would be but maybe poppy Harlow over there at CNN would actually a raise their hand and say okay\nCongressman Castro [noise] uh I understand your statement saying that you didn't intend can you tell us what you didn't tend to say because it seems pretty clear what\nShe said and and and here's the best part of his denial\nThat never got any follow up and never got any challenge and it's just accept it while he's that he says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take it but it's where they didn't intend to what he said I said was there was reporting to the fact that Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate\nYou see and now and now that's that's the crux of it because\nThey see everything that happens in this town Washington DC everything that's happening down at the border right now everything that you are seeing on cable news\nNight after night after night all of it\nHas to do with the mid term election that Kavanaugh hearings that was all about the mid term elections\nThe the the the way the media and the Democrats and some Republicans are reacting to this story of this a columnist for the Washington Post who
