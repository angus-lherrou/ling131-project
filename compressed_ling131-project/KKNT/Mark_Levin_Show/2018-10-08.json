be aware of is because of this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break into where you have a real noticeable thing than right to their little trips a little leaks here and there and so we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time be up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] Dr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium any of them is excellent for back pain

was the one who took a week of ah the formula ... formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer me out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use it for ... athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles in real relax shape\nThe really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and and the add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium needs them in the system so that very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish and in many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nDoes and it's so it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it

stress financial stress family stress any form of stress take the serious physical toll on your body and Dr ... you were talking about how you're killing ... formula\nCan help us in this battle against stress\nAnd I guess this is something everyone should be aware of whether you're twenty four or Ninety four\nI've used it for many many years as as a younger person and I'm Eighteen [laughter] so I use it then it definitely helps me sleep better it helps control the stress of the working world and many people will just be amazed how this actually work\nBecause our formula had a chemical reaction occurred before you actually ingested mhm Mac is treated at all it doesn't get lodged in your system\nAnd so what happened is that when people drink the ... it's like an infusion into your body is like like compress it and so people who aren't paying they take the comments the calcium and get into the muscles and it starts to relax it\nDr biggest you talked earlier about how stress affects your energy and I'd like you are to elaborate a little bit more on that subject if you would I mean the stress really affect our energy levels\nQuestion 'cause energies like the biggest thing right now like people chronic fatigue syndrome PMS fibromyalgia wiping people out and that's the key to low energy is a lot of it's caught by paying\nFeeling old your joints don't well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then they never get tired and you go to sleep I guess what you don't\nKnow I'm telling you like common scenarios due to lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the comics and the first thing that happened your ticket twenty minutes before you go to bed ... good night sleep and wake up feeling fresh energy comes back\nIs comic safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\nComics is never ever been shown to interact poorly with any medication\nOkay it's a hundred percent natural state and you know formula doesn't contain sugar which isn't a lot of calcium products we eat soy gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid don't have any of that but you see the point is is that if you're a person has a diabetic your and high blood pressure you had bypass surgery\nLiberal Democrats Harvard law\nTalk of course he was on full display [noise] I don't\nBlame him for being angry this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes they shouldn't be expected just

price and\nWe'll hear from Lindsey Graham\nWhat about these red states have their toes\nAll of them all all of them politically you know the only one seemingly even said no\nAnd we'll look at a solid

my program each weekday morning alive six to nine AM and on demand twenty four seven learn more at hue here at\nDot com what a week in the belt way that makes our typical partisan politics looked like a play around with stage before the eyes of the country this week\nUgly uncaring crash do come near to what transpired in a new phase of judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing it was an effort in and it's sort of ... the as soon as I argued over at the Washington Post this week\nThe Democrats will ultimately share the credit proceeding to ruin the lives of Brett Kavanaugh and his family likely is accuser Christine Blasey Ford Elite media outlets said their part in the ... and the allegations in the Washington Post and the New Yorker and then it was something of a free for all\nWhat unqualified legal observer professor Alan Dershowitz retired now from Harvard law school a lifelong liberal now moving somewhere near the center laid wave to the Democrats cynical miscarriage of this confirmation proceedings my colleague Dennis Prager took a closer look\nLet me read to you from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz\nAnd his description of what was happening\nIf he has failed denied the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible in prison and he may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully\nShe could be forced to resign as current traditional position because having the code convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence or some standard close to that\nA judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled she could go back to his life Robert Bork that both the Senate fails to confirm him now his life\nWill never be the same\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair and issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nBut we mail living in the age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism\nWe must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrats Harvard law professor\nDarker than McCarthy has\nEven know if you read the report of racial Mitchell the woman who seems to have asked you know ... very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide bunny assessment of talked to forge allegations in a legal context\nIn the legal context here as my bottom line he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove what this case is even a week or so that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell they pay you a prosecutor of sex crimes Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee newer nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard you understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world pull you need is the ... I think in the ... ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just ... live but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThat the Republicans seeking to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus the confirmation one\nOne week the FBI made additional inquiries guys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate and also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice [noise]\nNow if in fact when we get word that the FBI has done and that shouldn't all senators will have the report it's okay to file the notion of culture because that's just thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat is right down to the Senate rules are being at least a an intervening day in other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cultural wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for centers to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I catch a more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to make them because the institutions in America have not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nOf the terrifying narrative that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she has a millionaire with polygraphs inconsistent with their testimony testimony in this as a lawyer deal\nCould not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one could be disproven that's very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems with her testimony\nWell there are some allies of oil a ritual Mitchell\nWas retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um\nAnd I thought that a very professional job but I thought she got the basic facts out to the demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have some memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but\nI just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that the uncorroborated allegations should be enough to condemn or a nomination\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry ... Adler the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays the mold impeachment proceedings I say bring those on because they will be laughing stocks about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh wide I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful and attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're often this wild goose chase and the goal post is five\nFriend the majority leader likes to say uh after continued to move but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cutting number Fifteen what about\nThese red state Democrats I think they're\nAll of them all up all of them politically and all the only one seemingly ... even though there is no\nSenator Cornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried I think uh the uh I think the judicial I mean I'm Sorry I just I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what was he just said\n... has the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as a base was confirmed\nThat you know I think things very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the ... rejection McCarthyism directed\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and this is ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a part of sooner or not display the appropriate temperament on the bench\nThis man has been slander and he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nAh there were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he has to judge are centered corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut they shouldn't be expected just to take a business slant are these allegations of\nIt as as stopping that tax cuts in job to act what ever it\nIs they try and delay Dell a recess\nUm and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that person in\nAmerica disheartening over the place in the United states some very good news came out of mid week\nThe new trade deal was finally son with Canada several weeks following and signing with Mexico to the United states and Mexico Canada agreement for us MCA\nUs MCA will replace NAFTA which dates back to the mid nineties\nLarry Elder joined us even more of the Heritage Foundation for pick up their interview with more\nHuge victory for Donald Trump I mean we've got a new NAFTA modernized now but by the way I I always thought that there was a pretty good thing I mean unified our North American continent or Canada Mexico and the United states and needed to be modernized there were a lot of things in them out there that were out of date or unfair and Trump\nHad a big victory here first she got Mexico to sign on and then he's tighten the screws on Canada and they made some real concessions cheer Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make and now they're sets up very nicely\nFor negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to leave with China because they they are the worst uh you know abusers of portrayed lodged in on the planet\nOne other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump cut his past outbreaks of one of the point she\nSaid look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their tariffs on us and I often say you may not agree with the topic but what is it working 'cause he's countries are reducing their cherished\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries\nAnd the University of Chicago survey of probably kind of a sound Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did it you know and I told him I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped draft NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally passed their one Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the you asked them to see a we're not going to go on that any longer\nBut it is a new on North American free trade agreement that will open up orders a between all three countries is modernized because America is a better deal and so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage out in other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this do you also have area got me on that one I'm not you know we we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things they could have bad economics in this plan show I'm going to agree with you on that\nOne so on par though this bill lowers tariffs and barriers saw off for the candidate has imposed

C. V. than victory a why this week my in my vacation vault I'm going to explore new Smyrna Beach Florida\nSo personally I was there on in our flew into our land do and it's a great place to fly into we mentioned that on an an a different show with lots of it's one of the most are the most visited city in the world but\nI took a road trip guys over to new Smyrna beach and it is not to be missed this hidden in this place is Jim\nAnd mostly the locals and know about it as a great spot most of the tourists do not so I Am sharing it with you\nSo when ... when some of the locals want downtime a new Smyrna beach is where they had one reason is it's a good value destination ding ding ding okay so locals debit as the real Florida\nThanks to its laid back attitude it's an array of independent restaurants and it's strong connection to art and culture may get just an amazing well rounded visit so new Smyrna is a coastal town about an hour drive from Orlando but it's worth it it's a beautiful drive it's well\nIt's a lot like you know a ... a lot of small southern and eastern a surf towns\nFor those of us here in Arizona [noise]\nIt was a little bit reminiscent of Pacific or mission beach because it's on a big peninsula\nThat you drive out to and I'm making is such a cool beach town so there's it's known for its can canal street shops mild and broad white beaches and rich surfing culture\nThe city offers accommodations ranging from ... to condos in boutique hotel so let me just tell you for one second what my experience was like so that you guys\nCan get a picture real quick imagine\nWhat we're used to hear on the west coast\nAt least most of us go to California it's darker water and\nYou know there's at least it mission beach or Pacific beach like most of us ... have had you know there's a boardwalk and restrictions on the beach this place is completely different\nAt a condo over in San Diego is usually for you know a place right on the beach about two to three hundred dollars a night\nThis place was a hundred and fifty five dollars a night right on the beach with A Panoramic view you walk downstairs and you are right on the beach so also there was a um a lot of activity going on because\nIt's at Florida seems to be very neighborly whereas in California my experience I don't know about yours has been like thank you I'll keep my distance\nEverybody in Florida and very welcoming at least on by the beach and you know it really adds to the flavor of your experience and you know you you feel a little more relaxed on your vacation especially\nAs a single female traveling you don't worry about oh I'm a little nervous walking around here by myself because everybody seems to be very friendly interested in getting to know you helping you out if you need something just that southern charm in Florida I dunno it's beautiful so [noise]\nAll right now I Will say the place that we said across from um [noise] had a restaurant that also had evening jazz [noise]\nNow I imagine you can hear it from your hotel room and you trickle down and walk in and it was a entire restaurant called let's see it was called Napa Valley\nLet's see Napa Valley restaurants and it had all Napa Valley winds which I thought was also a very interesting for those of us here on the west coast\nThere was nothing as far as like eastern winds that with all the Napa Valley restaurant so you know that's another thing so let's let's go back to where I particularly stayed at a hundred and fifty five dollars a night that's significantly cheaper\nThan in California or much less Hawaii getting a coastal experience like that was phenomenal but sweeping new Smyrna is changing with the tide and snowbirds form\nAnd you know from the north and they call at you know\nThe the Orlando people call them yuppies and to ... they come in and buy property and the rent has definitely gone up but at the same time the new revenue and residents have given the town a bit of cool energy so it hasn't lost that charm as well so now here's the trivia\nThat punch inlet lighthouse in Florida is tallest\nLight house at a hundred and Seventy five feet and with over twelve hundred settlers ... settlement was\nThe new worlds largest European colony ever attempted end ... safari clubhouse surf contest and sells its signature hot surf sauce which is very popular there and local shops to fund scholarships for local students\nNow the city is located in the so called southern coast\nOf the region of the state of Florida it's regional term created by Daytona Beach Halifax area chamber of commerce\nThis can it coincides with the local area three eight six which spells fun on touchstones phones love that by the way new Smyrna beach\nHas a total area of almost thirty eight square miles and is bounded on the east by the Atlantic ocean new Smyrna is on the Indian River [noise] okay so\nQuick little thing as far as that goes walking down the beach is unbelievable you will see even people bike riding on the beach I'll get back to that in just a minute we're going to talk about\nHow you can drive on the beach from the neat stuff so it is eight ... surf town as well surfer dot com named the beach town as one of the best served towns in America in two thousand and Seventeen and you will see why\nIt has plenty of places to fish\nSuper small numbers and people driving on the beach if you go to my Facebook page you can see a small video of my girlfriend and I driving down the beach we got we were so impressed by that we took her video it was twenty dollars to just drive down the beach but it's it's a little [noise]\nYou know it's more neighborly personally everybody sort of it's like a campsite in a sense with a beach and on the west coast I personally have never seen that so I think it really helps\nYou know develop a better community of even vacation or you just feel close to everyone so everybody's playing around music has their own coolers and as having a great time and you know you even see people there's there is no boardwalk so you see people bike riding down the beach and I will say\nA little bit careful in the end of the day be jellyfish did come in a bit and we saw them on the beach so you've got to watch yourself because they're clear and there's a lot of people out on the beach they're like little landmines you do not want to step on one so\nWhile I'm let's get back to some of the facts though here because I Want to make sure you guys get as much about this place as possible\nBradford county is to the south and it's well known as being the ultimate surfer destination new Smyrna beach is reclaiming that role from Broward County\nSo over the inland from Daytona Beach is spring break madness and new Smyrna beach in contrast is quite a little community of course surfers and sure there is a bit of shark situation due to the nearby inlet but that's\nMaybe how everyone has gotten so good now I Want to make sure I mentioned this as well because I interviewed several surfers and a lot of like locals are 'cause I was so impressed with the area and you know just you know\nOur opinion being landlocked and being from Arizona here you know they get sharks there most of the shark attacks there are baby sharks and so you know they kind of have a little more blood they um attitude about it because they're little tiny teeny sharks\nAnd they do bite but they said it's like a dog bite so you know take that as he will it's not like you're going to lose an arm you might get a bite [laughter]\nBut it won't be that bad and if you want to try out the amazing surf out there it's\nBeautiful beautiful okay so now it is easily the most consistent break along Florida's a hundred and twenty I'm Sorry excuse me one thousand two hundred plus miles of surface coastline you'll find a sand bottom skate park stacked with\nPeak he ramps and barreling reforms at half an hour drive north over the bridge ... inlet accommodate a large Sal swells about further north in Bradford county or various beaches\nNow driving on the beach okay like I said go to my Facebook site you can see that it's something that you've you probably haven't experienced that can be so much fun we had a blast and it is twenty dollars a day [noise]\nAll right you can get back in ... and if you do have a little person they're taking your ticket but they give you a ticket you show and you can go and go in and out so\nThere is a ten dollar fee per vehicle I think I got in for seven for some reason it was like as a special day um and uh it it is really beautiful so very cool as well now turtle mound river tours um [noise]\nIf you ... you can hop on a forty foot pontoon boat to see the river wildlife and their natural habitat and get close to see dolphins manatees shore birds and fish as well so very very cool okay so\nThere is nothing like checking out the newspaper to see what the locals recommend for combinations\nI personally stayed at I mean it's going to give them a little plug not getting you know anything for this but it was really amazing when for those of you that want a good vacation you know little\nA little time away with the spouse or just getting away with your children this place with a value right on the beach called ocean truly him sweets hundred and fifty five dollars and I ... you know and it's\nAmazing now I Will say the one thing that if you want to be closer into where more of the action is it's not in the action is more down the beach\nBut I liked it it was great like I said that Napa place I'm with the jazz music was right across the street and also um\nYou know there is the if you want to say and more about like\nBusy area on near Flagler instead of the um\nThe in on the avenue is\nAwesome it is um you know really really cool and it has soaring ceilings and French country decor and it's a B and be in a bar as well and it's it's a really it has great reviews that's the other place I read about as well and um they actually have a complete\nDo it yourself pancake Gretel as well and you can get even make bananas foster pancakes there so I did not do that\nPersonally but that is something that you can go and do and it is\nTalked about quite a bit and another thing that is talked about quite a bit and you pass it on a one eight the main highway going in is and I thought this was so cool that I told my travel buddy or we're going back there tonight there is a place called nor woods and it is to tree houses\nThat have a bridge in between and it is a bar and grill and a restaurant and they light it up at night with these white lights and there's music\nI mean honestly this is like a playground for adults new Smyrna beach has so many cool things and it's on a budget and you really get\nSo much for your money there I mean I had a full meal at this Norwood place of a lobster tail I'm black and fish and shrimp\nAnd I think I spent twenty dollars on my dinner it was amazing and they have a very good wine generous wind poor as well so you know\nAgain if you want to see some of those pictures you can go to my Facebook site Victoria McVeigh or my

they don't go anywhere else to the cool places that are nature oriented you know guys that don't cost as much money\nSo and you can really have some then connect to reconnect with your family not be waiting in line\nYou know just have a great time now I'm going to go through because if you missed any part of this show please go to my Facebook site or my website Victoria McVeigh dot com and catch some of the pieces about driving on the beach and you know some of the deals you can get in staying there\nI'm fantastic place and also don't miss the the the tree house be so so if you're ever interested in the eating in a tree house you've got to check that out so I'm going to mention though that was a restaurant\nI'm going to talk to about a couple of the other restaurants there because you know frankly most people want to eat out on vacation\nBut you can do it inexpensively there and that is really nice um so I usually will eat breakfast or lunch in a place that I'm renting\nBut dinner out you know there's something magical about dinner out so by the way you can eat breakfast I took my breakfast out on the beach bowl of cereal and that's why I almost got hit by one of the cars on the beach [laughter]\nAri another did use is to hang on on the back of the pantry door to collect little items and that can sometimes get lost\nMaybe have a bunch of kitchen cabinet gadgets that get lost in drawers maybe it's cooking utensils like wooden spoons tongues are even ship quips now for me one of the things that I have is a\nLittle medicines for all of the children and my husband and myself little bottles of medicines if you have no idea they're shoved into the back of the pantry I mean those are actually at least in my house\nThe real problem for many of you because they're so tiny and they're expensive oh my goodness medicines are expensive so if you keep them organized and something like this you can get to them quickly when someone's not feeling well running a temperature\nYou know it's easy access as well so it really for me I prefer using this and my pantry for medicine so All right now you can also I'm here in Arizona and other states that are with warmer client climates we don't have to think about hats gloves\nBut um you know she organizers come in handy for starting hats and gloves because we do travel\nSome of us up to Flagstaff and if you venture further up north it will be ... so you know most of us do have at least a couple of pairs of\nYou know gloves and hats and those kinds of things so issue organizer is pretty handy in the bathroom as well it's a great place to put shampoos shower gels et cetera but you just you know\nUse the plastic one if it's going to be in the shower area so that it doesn't get mildew and and mold okay so an outside of the shower you can store the band aids and things like that you know if you do use that um you know in your bathroom and you keep your medicines and your bathroom I keep them in the pantry you know you can put your\nToiletries in there as well as your medicines 'cause it it might be I guess that's sort of expose a little bit we have a lot of children antibiotics and you know a\nIbuprofen and everything new snacks every bit of medicine for the whole family goes into the pantry so that's how I organized but for those of you that like to keep your medicines with your toiletries you know that's also a good idea All right so\nAll those little pockets are also perfect for storing markers glue and other art supplies for both yourself and your kids if you're gonna do this for officers that can also be really cool um and shoot organizers are also great for storing Barbies and other small dolls\nFor boys it's a great place to put toy cars and other small toys\nI'm if your scrap booking and you into that kind of thing the pockets are perfect for storing little bits of paper that always seem to be left over now for me I'm not a scrap Booker but I'm a seller so that does work really really well in that respect I have one I haven't set it up in my little sewing area\nBut it is a perfect perfect option so\nWhy not choose a shoe organizer also for gift wrapping for those of you my father is like the person at Christmas\nWe all give him our gifts because\nEverything turns out beautiful corners and beautiful bows and he has a whole section with a table and paper and it's all organized and this is useful for someone like my dad or if you have a member of your family the skin and an extra shoe organizer this can be a good gift for them so that they can get organized for Christmas\nAnd it was great for scotch tape you know tissue paper boats and and organizing all of that\nAnd so you can use a short a shoe organizer to keep items sorted for camping if you're a camper there is a lot of stuff that goes into camp bring like a needle you know\nRock climbing and whatever you can put Caribbean or is in there\nAnd you know you can put all of your stuff that you're going to use for camping kitchen gay gadgets et cetera now the other thing I have seen because my dad uses these kind of things is in his garage for tools he uses it for his tool bench but those men out there that are listening okay\nThis works great for nuts bolts all kinds of screws organizes everything into one place right above your tool bench and you can access it usually very easily because they're clear or you can put a piece it Scott masking tape at the top\nSaying bolts you know and very fast and easy so\nReally really great idea with the shoe organizer they're usually anywhere from I don't know you can find them probably an offer up or Facebook that's what I Would do don't buy retail by secondhand guys you know that was from another household hustler moment\nBut yes she organizers are a fantastic way to keep Oregon\nI really use what you have and move on to not having to re clean every you know three months because you have your stuff all over the place okay now we're gonna talk about running\n[laughter] [noise]\nSong just makes me feel nostalgic [laughter]\nOkay so whether I Am on the road traveling or at home I Love going jogging to keep in shape there are many places you can go jogging and new Smyrna I did do that if it was so beautiful and the wind is blowing in your face as your jamming\nTo your music okay so even though it's a smaller community a than Orlando you still need to be cautious and like anywhere you travel so\nWe're going to talk about again each week different things you can do to protect yourself while getting out there and exercising are exploring so mace\nMace pepper guard sport even though mace and pepper spray have been around for a long time it's definitely more advanced than it used to be amazed pepper guard sport designed to thwart an attack\nFrom ... up to twelve feet away the small handheld pepper spray it's easy to deploy simply flick open to flip top safety caps and press the trigger\nPowerful pepper formula when aimed at the phase causes coughing choking intense burning sensations and it provides a way to fight back against the human attackers as well as lose canines for those of you or I actually haven't been attacked by a canine but my fellow runner a has\nAnd she did not have anything like that on her in the back of her shirt got chopped so you know it's a real thing to get get a you know they get out they get aggressive so you gotta make sure you're protect yourself\nAll right so the drawback is the wind blow back so if you're spraying someone try not to be in the uh you know in the blowing wind [laughter]\nMake sure that the wind is working with you not against you because the spray can affect you just as much or more than your attacker\nAnd some states have restrictions on age and others require a license to carry mace it's relatively expensive and selling for around twenty dollars at ... dot com\nSo All right then now they're cool thing now this one I thought what was the bees and these guys are eight that tiger lady this is\nHas a special meaning the product is modeled after a cat's retrieval clause\nThe small handheld device is lightweight and will easily fit into the natural crews of your hand\nDuring runs it also comes with a wristband so you never have to worry about losing it if you feel threatened a simple squeezed will make the claws come out and give you a hard line or I should say a sharp line of defense [laughter]\nAlso the channels on the underside of the car actually designed to capture DNA seeking later identified an attacker love this product it was obviously made with women in mind\nA portion of the proceeds from each sale go to a nonprofit focused focused on ending violence against women that is a fantastic product guys it's so cool\nAlright aside from safety devices\nCommonsense is the first and best defense the national crime prevention counselor or a Mac recommends\nTo choose well let some ill your roots now ... can be a challenge when you're on vacation but you should you know be able to find a meta jogging group or you know that the people who can recommend safe running roots in ...\nIt's even better to find a buddy jog with and avoid distractions from ear buds I usually leave if I'm On my own one ear bud out so I can still hear my music um but it's if you put both and it's easy to daydream and distance yourself from reality because that's the idea little me time\nBut it's not a good idea if you're on your own and you're not you know with someone and um you know you could be in a situation very frankly in New Smyrna if you are running in the uh you know park areas there could be alligators okay let's be honest it's not as much the people there because they were super nice but ah\nAlligators could be waiting for you right around the corner [laughter] so you know I don't think the clause the tiger lady's going to work against an alligator but at least leave an ear bud out so that you can hear something wrestling or coming at ya\nAll right so if you think someone is following you switch directions or across the street if a person for this move quickly\nToward an open store lighthouse do not be afraid to yell for help now for me I run in the middle of the street if I'm hearing some strange noise or whatever so that I'm not close to either sidewalk of anybody getting me and I'm very much out there and getting attention um that's if I'm I'm really scared so that I can\nYear the the helps more than a million veterans so they can reach victories great and small\nVictory was getting my

talk\nTo an expert in tax and the state planning to find out whether or not the president and his family engaged in lawful tax the fertile\nAnd tax avoidance schemes or did they do something illegal let me just read you part of the articles of very very long article some of us would probably prefer to wait for the movie\nSo contrary to Trump's assertion that he received one million dollars from his dad and turn it into a ten billion dollar fortune it says that he received in today's dollars at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\n... much of it through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen nineties into Fort ... participated in dubious pack schemes during the Nineteen nineties including coat instances of outright fraud\n\nThat greatly increased the fortunately receive from his parents investigation by the New York times has found that we're going to ask my expert did the Trump family engage in quote outright\nFraud [noise]\nSaid that much of the money came to Trump hope because he helps his parents dodged taxes she and her siblings set up sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars and gifts\nRecords indicate that Mr Trump help his father taking proper tax deductions worth millions health formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars in tax returns sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred him and his siblings\nThe article said quote the maneuvers met with little resistance from the IRS calls but what does that mean met with little resistance you mean it was lawful you mean the Irish didn't care I mean the IOC didn't challenge it what are you saying\nSays that Fred and Mary Trump comes parents transferred\nOver one\nBillion dollars in well to their children which could produce a tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million under the fifty five percent tax rate than imposed on gifted in an inheritance is but the Trump paid\nOnly about fifty two point two million or about five percent of that quote according to\nTax experts it is unlikely to Mr Trump will be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents surveyed taxes because he acts happen too long ago and our path to statue limitations\nThere is no time limit however on civil fines for tax fraud I'm going to find out from our expert whether or not the president should be worried about a civil fines for quote tax fraud close quarter\nNow what is it based upon\nTime says the findings are based on interviews with Trump's former employees and advisors and more than a hundred thousand pages of documents describing the inner workings and the men's profitability of his empire they include documents from public sources mortgages is indeed probate records financial disclosure reports\nInvestigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records bank statements financial audit accounting ledgers cash disbursement reports invoices cancelled checks quote most\nNotably the documents include more than two hundred return from Fred Trump she's companies in various Trump partnerships and trust\nWhile the records do not include the president's personal tax returns and review little about recent business dealings at home and abroad dozens of corporate partnerships and tax returns offered the first public accounting of the income he receive for decades from various family enterprises\nSays Fred was a relentless in finding creative ways to channel money to his children\nThat Trump when he was three years old already earning two hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollar from his dad quote the most overt fraud\nWas all county building supply and maintenance\nThat the company formed by the Trump family Nineteen Ninety two cars in New York Times all counties ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for ... for ... buildings by everything from boilers to cleaning supplies it did no such\nThing records and interview show instead all county siphoned millions of dollars from Fred Trump Kim empire by simply marking their purchases already made by his employees\nThose millions effectively untaxed gifts then slowed to all these owners Donald Trump his siblings and a cousin Fred Venus a padded all county receipts to justify bigger ... increases for thousands of tenets\nAgain I Will ask my expert in just a few minutes did\nDoes any of this amount of something illegal does it amount to fraud I'm holding in my baby round libertarian fingers and article from force magazine dated July eight year of our lord twenty fourteen headline how one billion dollar Kennedy family fortune defies death and taxes\nQuote protected by a labyrinth of trust as well as tax credits that would make jokes at the Kennedy proud that can be fortunate now spans approximately thirty family members including the surname Shriver all offered and Smith\nThe bulk of the family's wealth is held in dozens of trust which range in value from tens of thousands too much at twenty five million nearly all are managed by Joseph keep Kennedy enterprises located in New York City the trust also protect the family after it from another set of prying fingers Uncle Sam ...\nBy holding assets in so called dynasty dynasty trust which are passing air to air for decades if not longer the Kennedy family is largely insulated from the estate\nTax handled correctly a dynasty trust could potentially maintain an on taxable fortune indefinitely the oldest Kennedy trust on record dates back to Nineteen thirty six\nAnd then they talk about the sale of the family's most valuable asset the iconic merchant merchandise marching in Chicago\nWants to start to be the largest building in the world and thanks to a carefully crafted deal
