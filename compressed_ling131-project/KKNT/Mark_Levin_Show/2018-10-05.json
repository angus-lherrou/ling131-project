going to talk about that later on\nAnd it was funny watching Dana Bash of CNN interview Tom Fuentes Tom Wendy's is a CNN contributor and he served as assistant director of the FBI\nOr and they were talking about whether or not the FBI investigation report throw one and I'm sure that Dan is bash expected him to say they didn't have enough time wouldn't be thorough if the opposite of what they had that for you later on but first my next guest was born and raised here in California\nGo to don't touch my Medicare dot com right now don't touch my Medicare dot com\nNow speaking of whether or not the yard record a comprehensive it's Thoreau Dana Bash of CNN was talking to a CNN contributor named Tom Fuentes\n... was an executive senior official in the FBI so he knows what he's talking about and I I could just tell her expression she did not like when she was here in\nTown and you have overseen probably more FBI background check and you can count looking at the profits\nHairs right after it was announced that the FBI had completed their report and to deliver to copy to the White House in one copy a then goes to the Senate just right after the news that the FBI completed their report\nLooking at what we know about what they found that and didn't find what is it patio\nTells me that they were Thoreau as they can be you know Kevin ... already been through a ... a background investigations including in the case\nBut they didn't need to go back over ground they'd already covered but in any background the use of alcohol drug other situations like that personal behavior is part of the routine back on\nAll the time so he would have been through those kinds of questions with classmates for professors neighbors relatives and friends that would have already been covered what ... was supposed to be covered in this case was\nWhat new based on what for side in her letter and in her sworn\nTyping you're given your experience do you think that the FBI had the ability to do as extensive a background check supplemental track you know the days ...\nHe served as assistant director the FBI from from a system a director to the FBI from two thousand for two thousand eight altogether he was the FBI for twenty nine years she asked him a very pointed question based on your experience and they have enough time to do a thorough background check she says yes absolutely\nBased on what for side in her letter and then her sworn\nTesting you're given your experience do you think that the FBI had the ability to do as extensive a background check supplemental tack that in the days that was a little bit\nBecause you've already heard in this case a week ago Saturday they're not going to look at anything except poor or allegation\nAnd then the next day you hear the already interviewed Ramirez so and now you're hearing today that they've gone forward with some of the other interviews that were done some of the other tips that they had gotten so\nThe White House just basically said we don't want you to do five years fifty thousand interviews in the case but narrow it down as much as possible to the most recent allegations that are credible and take a look at that and it sounds like they did or the senators who have already looked at the report wouldn't be saying that look thorough to them and [noise]\nWe should not Fox's on CNN I don't think they were pleased\nSeveral of them are saying mark judge in particular who is really a key person for a lot of that they have it all senator what talked to for for three hours um\nSeparately though we do care from the attorneys both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez that\nThey're not really that thrilled with without it went out and let me just reveal a quote from Deborah Ramirez attorney she was interviewed empire she has one of the night within four days later however the FBI apparently had concluded investigation with out permitting agents to investigate\nWe're deeply disappointed by the failure we can only conclude that the FBI or those controlling its investigation did not want to learn the truth behind ... action the the argument there at that she gave the FBI other people to talk to and then followed apply for it\nI mean I think the problem is that you let me control who you ask questions to I'm going to control what your answers are\nGoing to get back to when he's in the second\nAnd that they're going on because the dog like adequate house we're shepherding this whole thing\nTelling them and they are the clients to them though in them who they should talk to and that's all they can talk to doesn't matter how good they are when they're talking to them they're only going to get the answers the White House or the is prepared to have and that's where the problem is in terms of our consciousness so was the world on or not well on it technically probably done\nPerfectly but the problem is if you control who gets to the questions you can tell the outcome\nOf it right and I think other than what the crime or not in criminal investigation though not a normal and another normal thing that people think of when they think of the the iron but then the big part of what the FBI does so I think what is happening back story here that's going to play on\nYou know if the Democrats take over the house they are going to spend time reviewing what the the I didn't hear the FBI knows [noise] and that's why you see a lot of information including the tip line information is being set up so that you know the I think the kind of tired over the last couple of years of being sort of the political football\nFor yeah for the politics I Would I Would imagine Brooklyn the probably the right time for lawyers are saying that it back to when these ridiculous that she was a top kill is well as somebody who's done it before do you agree or do you think that but she had in public\nAnd then I Know I just agree and what you hadn't public was under oath\nYou know she tells you gave her a letter she gave her statements or through herself in through her attorney to Senator Feinstein back as far back of July\nBut she testified under oath for several hours as a judge Kavanaugh that their statement that's everything that needed to be dead and she applied the names of who they should look at and talk to to corroborate her story\nThey went to them they did that and if they fail to corroborate her story what else you know where else are they going to go they called like the still don't have the day time place or anything about this

[noise]\nRepublicans hold fifty one seats [noise] every Republican senator except for like Collins and Murkowski of Alaska [noise] come out in favor of the nominee [noise] you can lose\nOne of them because it's a fifty fifty tie a vice president Mike Pence would break it presumably in favor of cabinet [noise]\nJoe mansion [noise] a Democrat who voted in favor of the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch [noise] remains undecided Heidi Heitkamp\nFrom North Dakota was in a very tough race she's down the double digits according to one poll I read and the majority of people in North Dakota support the Kavanaugh\nNomination and of course North Dakota overwhelmingly voted for Trump steel she's now a no vote on Kavanaugh so you can lose one Republican just one and it looks like Collins dissatisfied with the throne is of the FBI report it looked like flake is\nSo we can't afford to lose anybody and that's why I'm a little worried about being sass from Nebraska turns out he did not want Kevin nominated not because he knew anything I think he felt that Trump should have nominated a woman and here's what he said today\nThe Supreme Court confirmation vote isn't a grand choice about whether we love our daughters or whether we trust our son it's better than not the choice before us\nThis is the consent decision about one person for one seat moral her also say that although I've said many complimentary things\nAbout judge Brett Kavanaugh and his distinguished record of twelve years of service on the DC circuit court I Will say that I urge the president back in June and early in July to make a different choice\nBefore he announced the nomination I urged him to nominate a different individual I urge the president to nominate a woman part of my argument then was that the very important to me too movement was also very new\nAnd the Senate is not at all well prepared to handle potential allegations of sexual harassment and assault that might have come forward abs annoying a particular nominee\nNo one really thinks that our body politic is going to get any healthier by giving more oxygen to the one man clown show that is Michael ... [noise]\nBut you know what [noise] not being down with the circus is not the same thing as being indifferent to the complexities of the me too movement I Believe that we have a widespread legacy of sexual assault in this country\nI slept with the victims of sexual assault and I believe the advocacy groups data between one fifth and one third of American women have been sexually assaulted at some point in their lives\nAnd given most women have many other important women in their lives along and the daughter sisters and a couple of close friends it means that the overwhelming majority of American women have been deeply affected deeply hurt by the tragedy of sexual violence\nI've had to near and dear friends who've been raped and it is an act from the pit of hell\nTo movement of the complicated movement but it is not a very good that we all know that the president cannot lead us through this time we know that his disposition only unable to restrain his impulse to divide us\nAs mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong but it doesn't really surprise anyone who he is\n[noise] Joe mansion as I mentioned from West Virginia is undecided he did vote for the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch according to recent polls the majority of North Dakota and want Kavanaugh confirmed by fifty six percent\nWest Virginia mentioned state majority fifty eight percent want Kavanaugh confirmed\nNow Senator Joe brand before the FBI report came down said that the FBI was not interviewing the people that were coming forward\nYou're told reporters earlier today that you've passed along a letter to the FBI from one of your constituents regarding the capital investigation can you tell us more about\nThat I found the at the front line who want clean every lifestyle I think for me I had a pretty hard for their background check\nOr what have you know the FBI is agreed to interview this person\nI think coming out now and I thought it would require because you're a lawyer because of that work for her and\nDianne Feinstein the one who sat on the letter for all those weeks so she had an opportunity to read some of the FBI report but not all of it\nAt nine o'clock this morning my staff and I reviewed the FBI support into sexual assault allegations\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh let me be clear I Can't talk about the detail because this remains a confidential part of the background report I Hope that uh changes are made and we'll be able to talk more about what the FBI\nDid later about what I can say is it the most\nNotable part of this report is what's not in it as we noted by the White House the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview doctors lazy for\nShockingly Dianne Feinstein feels that the FBI report it's an adequate as does senator Coons\nI think it's going to be very close um I think um\nThere's a number of senators both Republican and Democrat who haven't um\nYet the senator they did they deal with with like and I said at the time watch tunes and say oh it wasn't it wasn't adequate enough wasn't thorough enough they should have taken more time\nThat made public what their final position will be a and I hope they're going to look at this report and I hope they are going to reflect on a number of other things are ways in which a judge Kavanaugh showed um I think a partisan inclination or a lack of judicial temperament and how he conducted himself in front of the committee and a number of other issues\nYou see when you were accused of sexual assault you're supposed to be calm cool and collected about that and if you don't mean to you ... additional temperament\nIssues that have been brought forward or both through this process in public\nWell I've been accused of sexual assault if not right before I'm an old hand at this or a senator I really\nQuite ... I Hope that we reflect a hard on how this balances out against what they might hope to accomplish by having a conservative on the Supreme Court most of the undecided senators would prefer a conservative Supreme Court um but I think they have to weigh it against a fitness and character\nIn other words you have no intention of voting for him nor does senator Blumenthal\nMSNBC is reporting that they still have failed to interview now this is\nThe one who misrepresented his Vietnam record said that he was in country when in fact he was never in country probably as a result of and if you lie about one thing what did he say the Kavanaugh was even you lie about everything else so should we play the same standards and senator Blumenthal just saying\nSelf imposed constrained by rather straight to acting from the White House and they need to talk to for example one of the witnesses that I put in touch with them who can tell them about possibly improper outrages to key witnesses\nAnd there were mirrors incident who were known to judge Kavanaugh and potentially indicate that he knew about that New Yorker story before it came out\nWe come back Chris Cuomo said that when Trump quote mocked close call Christine Ford\nWell Colleen a thank you for calling um yeah it's kind of a complicated thing uh but what I've read is that uh the house being loss had nothing really to do with uh uh with Kavanaugh's family\nBut I thought you were you were you were going to say that perhaps\nAfford red judges book the book of fiction where a lot of names close to their real names were used for example there's a character in the book called ...\nAnd maybe she read the book and then simply I'm a parent if some of the things that she read in the book uh as to the drinking and all this stuff that went on a I have no idea whether she was even asking she read more judges ... I'm not sure mark judge is leaving them ...\nI read that you can get it on Amazon for almost fourteen hundred dollars a anyway Colleen thank you very much for calling the show I appreciate that I'll I'll look into this business about house being taken away and try to explain it all I Know what I read a few articles about it and it didn't seem to me that it did the amount of ... to a whole lot but thank you very much as two I'm\nBeen fast this article just came out from political and it says that\n... we have not heard from being asked about how we feel about ah the FBI reporting whether he's not he's going to vote in favor of Kevin uh but they did quote a Ben Sasse spokesman named James\n... who said today\nThat sasquatch has long been and remains a lean yes\nShe spent well over a hundred and fifty hours doing his homework and he pledged to fully review the information in the new NPR we report before announcing his vote close quote but he has long been and remains a lean yes now you've got Collins who called the reports are all\nFlake recalled reports or oh\nWhy would been sass call it anything other than thorough so I Believe he's a U.S as well so the only one we're really now are worried about is Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski of Alaska she's not announce how she feels\n... Collins and said that the investigation was Thoreau flake said it was ...\nOr you can only lose one Republican uh assuming for a moment the Murkowski says no then is fifty fifty and my parents would break the tie so assuming nothing change between now and Saturday it looks to me like Brett Kavanaugh was going to be\nThe next justice in spring court\nCuomo says that Trump's comments\nWhere he
