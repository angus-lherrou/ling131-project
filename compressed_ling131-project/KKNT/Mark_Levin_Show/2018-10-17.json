{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "I understand I think it was a Bloomberg estimated the cost of this or something like thirty two trillion dollars over the course of the decade\nAnd so you could make it clear that was trillions now feel yeah right but thirty trillion would kick our national debt in into oblivion a national debt would be so big it'll bankrupt that should be a horrible horrible thing\nBut Dan Obamacare solve all our problems remember when Joe Biden said yeah it's a big deal I thought it solve all our problems\nWell I'll tell you what Obama said you can keep your doctor if you want to and that was a lie this one here\nYou can't keep Medicare Bernays plan replaces Medicare itself with Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that there is twenty two million Americans people who have Medicare Advantage plans which are run by private companies and they would eliminate all of them that would be an increase fishing is fish would hurt seniors especially and that's why a Mac is against Medicare for all\nWhen when you want to get a left wing persons drawn to tighten the Dan Weber ask him or her who's going to pay for it who's going to pay for that but he was going to pay for thirty two trillion dollars over ten years yeah\nThat's right and in addition to that you're going to have rationing\nPeople say oh well Canada and Great Britain have great plants\nEverywhere I should keep this number line twenty two weeks that's how long it takes for a major surgery and Canada\nAfter they examined you may take months for the you have been examined that now they say yes you need this major surgery twenty two weeks average wait a lot of those people cross over the border and they get their operations in America\nThan wherever is my guest founder and CEO of a Mac ... association of mature American citizens now Dana probably mangled this guy's name but I Know the father of the Canadian health care system in Canada is named Claude Gaston ... or something like that and he won that sounded it in Quebec\nAnd all the other provinces ultimately adopted it he still alive as far as I Know in his nineties and have come out and recently said\nThat I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlawed private care and he pronounced the healthcare system Internet in Canada pretty much a failure\nYeah yeah and well we just gotta look socialize looking at a Cuba they don't even have\nA aspirin available in a local drugstores look at Venezuela they socialize the medical care thinking doctors running too much and now the poor people literally are dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because under socialism the individual mandate from nothing\nAnd I'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about this Canada Great Britain they have a a socialized medicine Canada has a what I think Obama wants to have which is single payer in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they were in a long time to go to a local call and I got to get taken care of and it won't be any money out of their pocket\nUntil they have a serious problem not only that the recovery race after cancer operations at the heart operations because of the way they rush medical care\nAs much less survival and Canada and Great Britain compared to the U.S was something depending on what type of cancer\nWhere somebody between twenty and thirty percent higher survival rates because it's not a machine like they have over there well you march in March out your number you know stop what is your relationship with the doctor it's horrible system or we don't need it and America\nMy guess is damn wherever founder and CEO of a macro association of mature American citizens and we only have about ... seconds left what ideas as a Mac ham on how to reduce costs of health care all\nWe got this free enterprise for example we have a bill in Congress now with mine co sponsors age are fifty eight fifty six listening to this so called the seven million people for free\nWe give doctors local doctors can take a simple tax deduction for treating a patient for free [noise]\nThat'll cost the government about fifty bucks for the tax deduction for the dog versus somebody on Medicaid who goes to the ER as a couple of testing costs a thousand dollars\nSo every time a person goes we estimate seven million people could be covered it will save billions on Medicaid and Medicare for the feds and for the state so that's what I was pushing\nThem wherever thank you very much for coming on founder and CEO of a Mac association of mature American citizens Dan thank you very much I appreciate it\nThank you God Bless God Bless\nMedicare for all forty thirty two trillion dollars over the course of ten years and when I was angry Ocasio Cortez was asked to pay for it she says well we're going to modernize things and and we're going to make things much more efficient don't you love it when someone who's never worked in health care\nHas all these ideas on how to make things more efficient because the people working in healthcare too stupid to figure it out we're going to have you

by Hollywood standards\nBut we really did you know we feed her you know we're really really happy with how you know what we got for that money you know and\nAnd I think they fear the by the way playing defense lawyer it's just unbelievable really you know it took over performance I bailing I can get get really it's an enormous amount of French people think he he gives good creepy you know he's a very good at playing Dr\nNow now the the man who played the defense lawyer a Knicks Hirsi yet he also directed the film\nThat's correct and he's you know your listeners will know him perhaps from justified and he was also in two of the Oscar nominated film last year he was in the shape of water and didn't treat billboards outside ebbing Missouri ... you know he's a well known character

great and I mean I I Love that scene in it it's very powerful\nNow when I when I said it it ran like a crime a thriller and it's because\nI didn't realize how on the interest in the mass media were in this case or in here you have the da ... the assistant da ... be detected that we get to the courthouse you're going to be ... by all these people because this is going to be the intersection of abortion and murder in this that and the other no body was there that's right\nRight it's extraordinary [noise] you know I'm a ... and it's completely true they reserve the largest courtroom because they expected you know to have a huge number of people because the news or the initial story you're sick of all\nI mean here you have all the major and your doctor who didn't turn up in New York Times and the NBC all know that didn't turn up\nAnd they didn't it didn't turn up until they were shamed turning up by an article in USA Today by cartoon powers but before that it was crickets in there I mean my husband's favorite like your attempt at the trial it quite by accident actually mean wasn't like he was intending to go there he was doing something else\nWith without fear in the courtroom and couldn't believe what you heard what he saw and then to see the ... bank after buying up these ... these benches with her with a reserve planning on them you know reserved for journalists and they were empty\nSo he was murdering babies that were born alive he was also performing late term abortions\nYeah and he and he also with selling and opioids he was selling prescription opioids to drug dealers but yeah but his main you know the reason we made the spell it because he was delivering babies life including the next week and getting away with murder basically for Thirty years\nSeventeen years no one inspector clinic and not you know it's a lot to do with Governor Tom Ridge a Republican and the Catholic by the way who you know who who ran on a pro choice chicken in Pennsylvania you know became the governor\nAnd and then said hands off the abortion clinics don't do anything like it to the ... when we put up to write whatever they call it a new one turned up and I know I mean trying to women died\nFor young African American mother died in two thousand I make a show no one knows her name you know\nIt's amazing that on the Fox news show when it when I was told to cook and I won with him and he and he said kind of quite dismiss it like you said oh we don't need any more about that story we all know about that story I like that to make a show is\nAnd he kind of shrugged and I said yeah but you know Michael Brown who wants to meet your show is you know here she she don't she dead and Barry Goldwater dead and buried and no one investigated and nobody from the department of health in Pennsylvania urge\nTo go and look and see what's going on and they had that perhaps a almost a decade later kind of my longer died young who's in these refugee possibly wouldn't be that if it was for the fact that you know nobody bothered they didn't even bother to check out what happened to me show it unbelievable\nAnd this story is one of those on told stories and that's really why we made the movie I'm quite wrote the book because this guy should be everyone should note this guy's name I Know what you know that this guy is worth out there and got away with murder for so long\nAnd ... mackerel him he is my guest she is the producer co writer of the book and movie guards nail the ...\nThe story of America's most prolific serial killer and we only have a

Warren affectionately refer to as the bad Pocahontas you want to talk about stepping in it in a way that is spectacular\nAnd Donald Trump and his ... says not manage to do what is a little bit Warren has done to her cells inside of about twenty four hours\nIt is ... or ... friend Bryan mud or do a morning show W. J. you know in West Palm Beach ideally mid morning show\nW. I. O. D. in Miami and occasionally I I think when they are uh you know kind of desperate for so many people on TV Fox News looking around to doing something with me in the end it's not that was that last weekend the mid term elections\nAnd it was great actually it was kinda waiting for the moment like I'll give anything illegal or try once\nAnd I was waiting for them to uh to to try to get me and they never\nActually was just a a good experience so a baby or the world a special on the mid term elections that was actually a lot of fun now we are three weeks away three weeks ... days Twenty one days from the general election\nOn the entertainment it's endless hit absolutely analysts Elizabeth Warren poke honest about it when\nYou take a look at her test CNN headline here Elizabeth Warren releases test with strong evidence of ancestry now and the series of events that unfolded yesterday you had the Boston Globe and I believe was the first to kind of lose their board over the\nStairs to his Native American and I don't think they actually ended up really looking into the whole thing they simply ... she's got to have it in\nThe Boston Globe even miscalculated family\nOnly by a factor of about a thousand how much native blood she may have in her but they weren't the only wants to run with it it's it is CNN they ran with it to you here's an excerpt from a story there's yesterday\nSenator Warren has released the results of a DNA Analysis showing she has just in Native American ancestry and an apparent attempt to preempt further questions and attacks she run for president in twenty twenty\nOr and first face scrutiny for her purported Native American heritage during her twenty twelve sitting a race for president Donald Trump has revived and amplify the controversy has the eyes weren't as a possible liable frequently mocking her with a name broke on us\nWarren has now been documented in in obtaining documentation of baggage per family lore\nAnd and now it's just I've heard genetic data performed by Carlos Bustamante I get all of that name to write bustamante the\nName of credibility a professor of genetics at Stanford and an advisor to ancestry and twenty three and me\nIn a row video what bell warns heritage to Massachusetts Democrats as seen sitting behind a laptop as she calls bustamante\nNow the president likes to call my mom a liar\nOr and asked him what do the facts say a bustamante in response the facts such as that you absolutely have a Native American ancestry in your pedigree isn't the way that humans to talk to one another by the white\nPedigree isn't that one more usually like talking about the brain of an animal nothing if it's high it's just\nI have never in the in the context of this conversation when they were sent in my family or with somebody else and talking about their answers for like your your pedigree and tell me about your your pedigree so anyway bustamante talks of her pedigree\nWarranted show nominee bustamante for report now posted on warns website along with others supporting documents in interviews detailing her background according to the report oh this is\nJust kind of a minor detail here the majority horns identifiable ancestry is European oh however the report as however the analysis also identified find genetic segments\nAs Native American in origin at high confidence bustamante is analysis places warns Native American ancestry between six generations ago with a report estimating generations\nUh okay let's take a look at something here this is where\nThe Boston Globe and they're they're\nReally got off track by the way really got off track trying to figure out a the the six to ten generations okay so if maybe there was a little bit of a Native American thing going on let's say eight ... rations that go\nAlong with that equal here and the answer to warn as it turns out more lily white middle Whitey white folk like perhaps you want me\nIs what the experts have actually been able to find after they dug into the report on our website warps\nNow throughout the course of the day\nI have heard from my my friends still lives here in the in South Florida has been talking about this and the noise continues to be allowed out there and social media and it is fascinating the dearth of knowledge on this particular subject that seemingly the average Alaska to want to be socialists\nActually has about Elizabeth Warren received a question why is it why is it that this is even an issue well the first thing happens to be made in one again [laughter] and she was already ill nobody told her to go out there and get oh actually President Trump did\nPresident Trump did in fact ah do you have cut three ready\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] uh let me think about that one [noise] she's on being a minority [noise]\n'cause they always say well I'll let you guys are saying is [noise] and I apologize audience tonight [noise] apologizing [noise] ...\n[noise]\nYou know even the liberals are saying\nTesting is entertaining and president Donald J Trump president of the United states at a rally back in July she says she's the one who put it back out there you have to wonder\nYesterday that the president prompting her like that you think she was asked\nIf she supposed to be ideally educated right\nWhen you actually like try to figure out exactly what the results of your test would mean before you go out there and say yeah you know I'm a I'm turkey\nHere it is and then the experts you\nActually know lighter than the average white folk here in the United states just saying go either way but that wasn't the best smack down the ball now in the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kind of smack down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday\nCrying DNA test do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were in detention it's in North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations said the only legal requirements for citizenship in a while DNA test can be used to determine lineage such as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliations\nOh by the way he was a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA testing and it's a legitimate uses while also does honoring a legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who is heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with hurricane tenuous claims of tribal heritage\nIs once again so goes the dynamite any questions you can have the the president the United states were forward to\nElizabeth Warren a bad book on us as he might say as a fraud\nBut we only have to do is listen to the secretary of the Cherokee Nation that she claims to be enough\nTo call for re fraud\nOh by the way how many details you know these little things part of the the liberal argument that I've heard of answer out today it's well I mean what difference does it make anyway in Trump's tax returns okay let's talk about the tax return thing real quick so let's\nWater phony he continued you went down there he had a lot of fun just worried that now that her claims of being Indian Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam an ally\nElizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this brought against the American public Harvard called her a person of color amazing God and would not have taken her otherwise and again this is the important point here we're talking about the Elizabeth Warren deal is not just oh it's another politician line it's not that\nNumber one enemy is a lie it is a fraud but she has kept up her entire adult life\nBut secondly it's not a victimless situation she committed fraud for personal gain every single step of the white educationally professionally even went in because a couple of steps along her career path\nThese institutions and identify her as a Caucasian\nShe made sure that she was always referred to and had it would have changed that she was Native American or a person of color seriously seriously\nBut in the president's always end up he said thank you to the Cherokee Nation already feeling that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas you can just see him and hear him saying that to ... is a complete and total fraud and again\nYou don't have to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do taken straight from the tribe that she claimed to be part of\nA kind of tough for her to rally back from that one of the way the the president in terms of toys holy cow he had all kinds of moments today including moments in with a story Daniels now to be ready for it to you was I guess horse face\nThat that that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabians situation will be discussing that a little bit of a leader in the show we have the oh by the white Honduran caravan
