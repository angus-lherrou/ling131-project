S. is done by general surgeons and it's done well by them\nBut in short order there is data to support the fact that breast surgeons do less mastectomies than general surgeons\nWe'd do less modified radical mastectomy so\nI think you know it really comes down to who's a good surgeon who is not and certainly one of my partners is not fellowship train but he is certainly a very skilled and only does press so\nAny time you get someone who specializes in does more of something they're going to be better at it so a general surgeon who might do ten percent of his workload has breast\nIs not going to be as fast style of someone who does a hundred\nPercent\nOkay tactic costs I think you saw yourself short I mean the changes in breast surgery over the last five to ten years have been profound with ... yeah first it was um ... you know up to Nicholas ferrying mastectomies or doing skin sparing mastectomies\n'em and all of these additional options now for surgery have really made it added to the complexity of the surgery and really I'm always encouraging patients to see a breast surgeon because they get all of the options and I think that's what's really becomes so important today is having all of the options\nGood points thank you Dr quiet it for free and I agree with Dr quiet [laughter] yeah you're probably right that a breast surgeons will do nipples sparing where's the general surgeons will not back event called\nThe uh idea that reconstruction is considered in large part cosmetic there is a assumption that the procedure there for them would not be covered by insurance\nAre expert\nI Love this question is one of my favorite questions because I get to about ten times a day [noise]\nThe one thing that Congress did right on the first try the woman tells act of Nineteen Ninety eight in which it as a woman can have reconstruction as a medically necessary procedure\nFor mastectomy and Contra lateral symmetry procedure which means anything that needs to be done to the other side to match is covered by law so if your insurance company says oh well this is cosmetic to get to talk to me\nThey don't like that conversation 'cause then I start bringing up legal terms and they don't like that but by law government says they have to cover reconstruction as any medically necessary\nProcedure and by the white folk so just to let you know a a\nDedicated a these are individuals are in front of me a long way for their time schedules and everything else to take time out to be with us but the doctor Franco has a a serious case of learned drivers so says you're wondering a yes\nOr sound a little raspy she's she's straining to to make herself for your herd than we are pushing it a\nImplants and go back to him plans for a moment a once a an individual has an implant\nSo they uh prevent a detective detecting cancer\nNo absolutely not so much for it even plants in this day and age are actually play suicide muscular position and most ... refers who's been doing mammoth mammograms long enough which means basically if he's been doing a more than a year\nWill know how to do displacement news meaning they push the implant out of the way to look at the brass\nThere are a few views where it's harder to see because of a breast implant but realistically it will not change detection\nMammograms have gotten so good over the last few years especially that in in its aren't going to change whether or not they find something\nThat also pushes the of said also pushes the breast tissue forward which can make it a little bit more easy and clinical examination as well that is over here and plan does not block out the ... the detection pretend tribute faction of the lesser\n\nGo ahead oh since I no not at all okay All right ah that's a start go briefly why we have just a moment a doctor Dylan if all the cancer is removed during surgery I think where you've touched upon ... came over as not made it after that\nUs and so that's not true um criminal breast cancer is a team of doctors a and like don't recall was alluding to addicts or surgeons radiation oncologist medical and colleges and all these things go hand in hand with the ultimate goal of defeating cancer\nUm in general in early stage breast cancer chemotherapy is given to eradicate the invisible cells that are left behind after surgery\nOr these cancers are may have escaped to breast area and launch themselves in different parts of the body this is called micro ... disease offer a patient has had successful surgery micro ... disease is the one that pose a significant risk of cancer occurrence and ultimately death\nSo ah fortunately you be a do have guessed that help us determine what cancer is likely to recover versus what cancer is not one of them as uncle type D.

zero ... just tuned in we have Dr Michael take us back in the studio with us today he's a leading authority on both natural and alternative health we've been talking about\nHow critical vitamin C is in terms of overall health\nNow Dr Prentice I got to ask the question I mean you know you you it's kind of talked a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough on them and see but you know the reality is\nThat I'm sure I'm not getting enough item and see based on what you said I I I'm not arguing that point but the reality is that I'm Still standing I I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here I mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. but you need to have in order to be healthy\nWhen you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a de minus because they're already a for vitamin C. it's sixty milligrams sixty Miller they're empty tire Lee inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the writer mouse and the right form in order to get yourself into a high level health or why it why is that so critical do why is getting enough fight 'em and see so critical\nWhile just recap number one your body doesn't make it\nToo is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least\nThree thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per day vitamin C. you're going to be someone who was on multiple medications you run into doctors you're got blood pressure

benefit of having those twenty two different sources well the benefit is is is that your body recognizes these from nature\nAnd there's there's a number of different sources from nature there's rose hips broccoli\nTo certain type of cherry called an asteroid cherry lemons lines grapefruit with the super ... to ... I've tried to duplicate what's in nature and I put it into one form I see okay well speaking of which can we can we make some yeah I Want to try it right here yeah okay All right now why why a powder
