looking to buy or sell a home you guys have ways where they can save thousands of dollars and even put money back in their pocket get them into homes for out of pocket right now she can I ask\nYou a question about that so there is witty just thinking in my mind where they are not not a teacher but someone who works for the school as a coach or a security guard they qualify wild him interesting wow I Would never I when you said that I thought oh man I didn't know that about the program\nAs well pretty much anyone on payroll at a school huh yeah I Am school payroll you gotta love it got all of it we have a great market update today also Josh in the stall has a couple of different topics follow the golden rule\nAlso millennials homeownership versus starting a family are taught that there you go and then of course a real\nGym in the valley here some real estate's come back we're going to talk about so you know it's\nInteresting because we were just talking about mortgage fraud yeah now this is a mortgage fraud but interesting there's an interesting yeah Frenchman story but ... why don't we start going to be safe out there man you know that's you know we don't just talk about you know doing business over ... we're protecting our consumer ...\nIf you are an investor or a first time homebuyer you're not going to want to miss the show we have a coming soon property that's going to hit the market in about a week and a half and it's located over in Chandler at re and McClintock area\nLittle sixteen hundred square feet three bedroom two and a half bath two car garage priced while under three hundred thousand we think about that and that's a ... for the most are eighty five eighty eighty five\nPercent remodeled his well under three hundred thousand did yes her man that got us so the fly\nYeah it's not going to last one I just put the coming soon sign out day before yesterday and yesterday I got a call from a from a guy that lives across the street that's been waiting for something to come available he's from Southern California and moved out here a year and a half ago him and his wife and his daughter so he called on it and I said soon as the tenants out of there which is going to be tomorrow\nAnd said I'll give you that the foot in the door right there take a look at it before it hits the analysts so he wants to buy it sounds like a year but we'll see I mean you know when that coming soon signed goes up and some of these areas that we specialize in people calling them right away so why don't we dive into the show do what do you say they're Josh with American update\nDive in water and water and I [noise] yeah I'm going to go by you liked that one admit it and I don't know oh come on I was hurt [laughter] Jovan opposed to that would hurt it but\nYeah I'll go to the update but I just as I Know I never heard that before the flush said that [laughter] I've never heard of him and sometimes you got to be a pioneer with one liners must be a false of cities they must be officers and I haven't lived there for almost Thirty years my friend [laughter] I'm like I'm going to get to this real quick 'cause we have so much to talk about [noise]\nUm so it's not a secret over the last two weeks mortgage rates have really jumped man\nUm if you're out there you're under contract or thinking about refinancing lock now because it's probably not going to get\nYou know go back down I mean we've seen some pretty dramatic increases you know that being said still you know five percent of that term a tremendous rate you know Thirteen fourteen percent when I started doing this you know five percent still very affordable\nHey Josh real quick back in ... foreign oh five when everyone is coming from around the world to buy homes here ... interest rates are six and a half to seven percent back then that's right so if you remember that yeah\nYou know I Do and I remember you know selling eight nine ten percent um the problem is you know we were really really spoiled for about three years and then I mean you know that's a very unheard of period of time to have a right to that low ... I mean\nYou went to stretch of just you know three three percent ... some people think that's still the norm which just as any more it wasn't even the norm back then you know and like I said last week and you no matter what the rates are people who are you know you start you still have to buy a home ... um some some better news uh\nTo suddenly see a little bit of a reduction necessarily in the high end home pricing um\nYou know those seem to be on the market little bit longer so this is the first time we kind of seen those is starting to peel back as far as um the list price versus soul price um another another good little tidbit\nUm lumber pricing is as dropping so that has a incite a you know made homebuilders want to build more so the builder confidence is increasing so that should\nUm result more new built throughout the valley\n[noise] that's interesting you say that because I just talked to a good friend of mine who's a\nA a big cuts to build her here in the valley do a lot of ah and I'm not going to say they do big subdivisions Michelle who is well it's all it's my cage with rainy homes or go [noise] and a really good guy loving guy totally cool and I was had a conversation with him and he was saying\nThat they are a little bit concerned about the spec homes looked at the ... you know kind of contrary to what you're saying but he's in the business and he's saying that it looks like it's going to slow down a bit because prices of materials are up\nAnd now with interest rates going up and you can kind of speak to this little bit and this was white people need to get off the fence and make a move if they're looking at buying a home because when interest rates to pick up a little bit doesn't that make it to where affordability their their purchase power goes down a bit\nAbsolutely so um let me just read this line so builders are relieved the lumber prices have declined for three straight months\nSo it's been you know your buddy I'm you know the other other things might be a factor in the cost threat but I think it's it's the rates man I mean I'll I'll tell you um I had a client who was out there shopping looking in um ... he had two homes that he was trying to get in under contract\nWhen he started the process he was a four point eight to five ...\nHe finally got into his home and we were ready to ... he's at a five point one to five so it's a big jump interesting it's a big jump and that's only in about a two and a half week period while and now now that's a little on normal that's like like I said earlier the rates have been crazy lately [noise]\nAre are there ways to lock in rates early or does it costs money or their loan programs where you can walk rates in early for free\n[noise] Mm not no I mean you can't uh so all of a lock doesn't cost you nothing someone's charging ... that's a joke okay okay there's no there's no cost a lot of reading but the longer you locker right in the worst rate is ideally I tried to lock my clients and to the ... the shortest period possible which is Fifteen days guy\nYou could do a thirty day which is very common but like I said I Try to and I'm not doing it lately because it's been so volatile sure but I Try to manage it so that it I can get them a little bit lower rate on a Fifteen de la okay so if you do the sixty would be way worse\nNow [noise] it's good to know ask your buddy about the lumber I'm care so that is true maybe that's just nationally 'cause this is a national ... a statistic you\nKnow what the lumber the lumber could very well go down in price but you still have labor costs have gone up absolutely and then just other you know other items that you would put into a custom home I mean there's so many ... you know obviously so many moving parts\nSo many in the mirror up to several quick so you know I hear a lot of customers talk about hey I don't want to buy this recession coming da da da da and just ... twenty ... twenty six percent of the time monetary policy has induced over the recession pretty interesting how it is um then I'll just wrap this up with kind of a a\nOf a um I don't know let's get that\nLet's let's just wrap it up right there [laughter] well I was going to say it's kind of interesting with the holidays ... what do you think the day with the fewest birth is\nAnd it's weird the day with the fewest first verse Christmas ...\nOh thanks for answering it I mean I was just putting some of his audit or about to guess Christmas though I wasn't as rod I guess since she's only female in many ways you know\nThat it's interesting I don't know why is that in there but big birth dates or nine nine is one of the biggest birth dates and really interesting little tidbit there at the end it is I like that or you know

started here but you knew but ah give it up for something else\nThat I play play a little little rougher sport for a while ago [laughter] but hey I'm the millennials homeownership versus so yeah so I'm In the family\nSo we we talk about one of those a lot and you know kind of dragging their feet to to purchase because that that is going to be\nYou know the biggest population of of purchasers going forward and I mean that's good that's a huge group of people that you know for ... need to tap into [noise] so um there was a um I got this from the housing wire dot com bank of America did a survey\nAnd two out of every five\nOr millennials are now putting off starting a family so getting married having kids the whole nine yards to buy a house\nSo you know we we talked about it before on many shows back that you know the most loyal just aren't ready they dig they're living at home they take more time or they want to say but more money um you know things like that\n[noise] what are your thoughts on ah becoming a little more financially you know buying a home getting settled and then having kids what are your what are your thoughts on that and\nI have kids in my age group right now and I ... the first starting a family\nI agree a hundred percent I Would too what about you just\nI Would agree as well not not ... not necessarily may have done it myself that way but [laughter] but I mean it it makes sense um\nBans are speaking from experience right that that's the way you do you do you get a house first and then during\nThe you know the bank of America report says um [noise] you know there there have been letting their priorities fall in place on them or at home ownership first marriage and then children interesting that that seems like the way it should be done but\nThat's the way I did hear sounds that's where I just wanted to be settled first and kind of you know get my get my roots planet if you will and then and then you got married and had kids\nLet's go perfect cool interesting Seventy two\nPercent among the millennials consider homeownership a top priority followed by a eighty percent there's retirement [noise] something I Want to retire\n[laughter] and and I have some some quick starts a free of time on this and so the\nDifference between buying now in waiting a year yes this this kind of goes on to you know why the millennials should should by now and this is a um a study that Fannie Mae did um there are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae\nUm so if you wait now if interest rates continue as they're as they're going up um you know a year from now you're probably looking at five point to this not a little bit higher as far as interest rates\nUm the average home prices now is right around two fifty a

affects each and every one of us in that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThey are it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects their body sure so stress affects the body is this I'm\nOn a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension\nAnd your mother ended up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right\nAt the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel that has that most of the arteries oh that guy ended up and the mothers the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that\nIs completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved but it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people do you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel for this and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with the picture and it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their\nHow many ... at issue it\nHas to do with simple absorption calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah and it does do here but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't a diet you know and to us from the bones and self\n... orbit back from the bones if neither that's right but I say and what\nYou just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yep okay\nAnd so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian irradiated hum the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer great but these things don't absorbing the body that's happening for a couple of reasons\nOne when you take a let's say an aunt that had the ... minute like Tom's first of all calcium absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that\nPowder and what happened to put it in hot water and you mix it up and drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that sounds that problem as well\nYeah because when Cal say many of them are in a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says the symptoms or being calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing them take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills but the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula says absorbed in credit when the body the thing is that when you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right Dr pain 'cause I Can't believe a thirty minute took the ... the pain in my wrist one way or I was able to sleep for the first time an error I mean this is really amazing\nAnd have them do a couple of Dr fire ... around in front of those people [laughter] I'm pretty sure they would stop [laughter]\nYeah I Know I take I take first lifted the first one first and second one second I take the point on the Republican form of government to the republic for which stance of course it's a Republican form of government and not a democracy I think\nI'm are conservative brethren in friends will use the phrase um variants of the phrase democratic small D things like that I think it's I I think it shorthand knowing full well that we are not a democracy when are promoting\nWell I Hope not but I take the point and I will uh I Will be of course more careful on it I Hope not because you're absolutely right now as you All right yeah I Know you can you can't\nBut I don't think it's unfair to talk about democratic norms unless you tell me it is no no no no no and I don't make it fair to talk about democratic symbols symbols item yeah right okay we're on the same\nPaying them and Karadzic yeah no I mean quite a thing or democracy like bad guys I Know I didn't ... know you were ... view yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm a credit card will have a problem okay\nDemocratic Party we have a democratic form of voting yes but it is\nFor the Republican\nServices are public and form of government of course represented\nThe or representative ... you know you can't\nGet people to and that's what it is kinda like their diluting the ... a\nDemocracy down to the same as racism or\nI I think what point did is it is it is well worth making and it's well worth making over and over again because it's well worth reminding people all the time about our history and what constitutional Issam really is here we we have moved so very far from it I take your point on the\nOn the second point and yeah hold me to account watcher [laughter] no do and I will only way if if it's a habit of developed I don't think I have but if it is I'm the only way to stop it is you know if I've ever\nHeard you said it's been very very very rare\nYou will snap my wrist with the rubber band if I Do [laughter] I have given you that assignment but on the second I I Am thinking um [noise] that that it's it's a\n... and you tell me I'm a I was talking about symbols of democracy how 'bout symbols of sovereignty I just don't think the vision of this the optics of this are helpful to the cause for which stance I think it's going to a boomerang I don't think anyone can look at this and say we need less border enforcement\nExcept for one problem with this particular situation which is that it's happened already but it is and it's obviously more visible in the news yeah [noise] uh\nIf the president\nCaves on this and get gospel truth I don't know how he can stop it without using force I don't know how he can stop it because\nThey bashed through Mexico Mexico's police were down there to try to stop now how tough they were being I don't know about how tough what our guys ... you know especially when they put the women and children out front\nSo but the other thing I I thought of today when I was looking on the Internet I saw a couple of those pictures I challenge anyone to find any photograph book that group of people walking nor that\nLooks hungry tire thirsty and showered they're all a nice clothes\nIt doesn't you might not be done to look like a standard asylum seeking movement\nTo say have been walking for a thousand bucks up now no model so\nBut anyway I just this whole thing is being promoted and funded by somebody\nWe ... we probably know who I hate to even mention I Know we do not have not given more press get right into anyway I just\nYou know there's no you got five thousand people that are going to the border of the same time there's not an easy fix for this but you can't go or getting a lot of men to let you see how bad it was a lot of bad you can't do that\nNo no I Know I and I think that that notion that very last one you mentioned the worst the better and that's kind of a ... view of things that I've never accepted I mean you know yeah I just I ever expected you know things go to health so that\nWe like jamming out condoms arise in grade school saying well they're going to have sex anyway we just wanted to get me started on that one [laughter] oh my gosh it's the same cycle [laughter]\nEnds of mine are you trying to push your [laughter] lord [laughter] I'd rather I'd appreciate all thank you sir\nPaul called president so I'm a Gen Xer the answer hey well I think there are already in Tucson we got plenty of 'em no [laughter] do you call me\nYou'll have a likely better likelihood of getting in if I miss step and confused or Republican form of government with something else our goal of course is to preserve it in all its form so I Do appreciate that I'm that important point in\nYour right um they do say that you're right the media and particularly op ed writers\nDo use that phraseology but I I go back to my first question really before I even got to the merits of a lot of what this columnist Charles Blow in the New York times was writing I I don't even know if he believes that I I just I literally cannot tell I literally cannot tell\nIf he's the fool or name I think a fool I think a fool [noise]\nSix zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following and they paid political announcement movie or the ... too many lives and

anybody on a conservative talk radio who might have provided endorsement\nOh OK thanks um um yeah so I'm ... I it's funny this year I'm more than almost any other year I don't know if you've noticed this to Anthony but\nI've been getting questions more questions about help on um selecting judges from the vote from the early ballots that have been mailed out then I can remember in past elections are so I'm not sure if there's more for our\nTeam our side is just waking up to the you know more and more uh you know waking up to the need to ensure that our judiciary has judges that actually understand the constitution from it's a perspective of original intent or not [laughter]\nDum la ... the culture principles to follow us there is a step leaves and show [noise]\nTalk about one day October twenty second two thousand and Eighteen this is the ... leaves the show I Am Seth Leibsohn our phone number is six zero to five zero eight\nZero nine six zero [noise] I um I have a bunch of stories I Want to cover what you hear this hour but I also have two questions that have\nKind of been um [noise] been bothering me or the last few days and I guess there's good a time is ending to get into them a a for a night in a day away from our elections are the first is um and maybe we'll do a poll on this survey through our\nTwitter account or something but I I Am really genuinely interested in you know in in what you're thinking is regardless of who you're voting for\nRegardless totally regardless of who you're voting for who will actually win\nA Senate race between mix Sally and cinema [noise] um I have watched the polling um which seems to slightly right now slightly favors the latest I've seen slightly favors cinema but I don't think with a robot liable enough margin\nFor anyone to rest anywhere near or close to the neighborhood of easy\nBut regardless of whether you're voting for her or not and I'm just going to presume most of your voting from excel who do you think will actually when how does it look to you on the ground or in other words the polls right\nAnd the second question Robert robbing the republic had a piece on this today um and Donald Trump is speaking about it on the on the ... and his rallies a little bit\nUm is he on the ballot\nWhen you vote safer um excel your for your Congress men or congresswoman whether to elect them for the for the first time or whether it's to re election bid\n[noise] are you voting a with particular already a of a favor with particular favorability towards that congressman or congresswoman that candidate or are you voting for Donald Trump's agenda how much does Donald Trump's agenda way on your decision\nTo vote those are the questions I'm interested in in answering I Will tell you I'm On the national front it does look really good\nFor Republicans generally when it comes to some of what earlier on was thought to be some close Senate races article out of the hill\nJust not particularly a partisan\nPaper they write the battle for control of the senators looking worse and worse for Democrats who just a month ago saw paths that the majority but now increasingly looked like they could lose more seats and have a smaller minority next year so the Democrats thought\nThey were going to take the Senate at this point there now just trying to staunch the blood flow of loss of further losses to a bigger Republican majority\nRepublicans have seen a bump in the polls in several Senate key races since Labor Day and they believe momentum has slipped to their parties since the fight\nOver Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nPolarized the electorate a two state for Democrats had hopes of major upsets Texas in Tennessee are now clearly moving in fact I have now clearly moved\nTowards the favor of Republicans what they say about our state I Know you want to know here it is races in Nevada and Arizona to other states where Democrats had hoped to make gains remain tight but\nRepublicans feel more confident\nAbout their candidates I guess that goes to my sense too about the confidence I haven't mix Sally doing a lot better uh on November\nAh well one would wake up November seventh or when we go to bed November six than the polls are right now showing I um I think as you heard me say that\nUm that\nUh the Democrats may have some buyers' remorse\nWith how outrageous some of the recent past statements of cure students cinema were\nI think she's a little surprised frankly herself\nCinema herself as a little surprised that uh they have been I'm making so much hanging over her statements because I don't think she thought they were outrageous if you look at her\nResponses one question about them she seems either dismissive or supportive of them not very convincing in distancing herself from them which she could have done had she wanted to or\nHad she believed it uh I I I don't think she does to believe what she said in the past indeed her most recent interaction last week with Arizona Republic on the Taliban quote\nWas to basically basically doubled down on it she basically defended her comments on it um both in style and in substance and style she said she was trying\nYou have a conversation along and in some said she said she was protesting the war and they were good reasons to do so there weren't to no three there weren't you know three there would have been maybe perhaps good arguments not maybe perhaps there would have definitively been good arguments for waging the war differently\nOr there might have been an argument for um\nA ... certain hearings and reauthorization of it but no I'm the idea that are going after the Taliban was was anywhere near debatable in two thousand three um unless you were Michael Moore the fever swamp left in which he traffics I'm no\nNo and I don't think I really don't think Arizona is going to support that Jim is in Phoenix Hi Jim\nJim is in Scottsdale fell on\nDid you start in Phoenix where are you on hold for so long that when you crossed Seventy fourth street\nSo I went from Scottsdale a cave down through cave creek and I'm back in the scout okay [laughter] so it's just\nSo happy call and the first time caller a very avid listener congratulate really really love the intelligence of your show\n... thank you not without having the fact that we confuse two major cities here the entire show not withstanding are geographical low labor so okay\n[laughter] well ah to give\nThe uh the uh call modern monitor
