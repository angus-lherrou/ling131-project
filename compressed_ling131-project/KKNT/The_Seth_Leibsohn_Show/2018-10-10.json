sometimes a general idea of what they're calling about and\nI haven't had a George used to be a hugely popular name and I just don't I I'm trying to think I I don't have it at any Georgia's in my life I don't know any Georgia's it used to be a tremendously popular name and I just I just want her to pause on that for a second\nWell to this\nDay I guess today as a news [laughter] [laughter] yeah it's very rare you named after a family member\nOr [laughter] [laughter] we were you named after a family member or how did you get the named George\nI was it\nI was named after a family member I read on Monday and go back to generate\nInteresting okay alright I looked it up by the way I have to tell you it's one of the one hundred and twenty five most popular names in America for a boy\nPillar of the soil saying well yeah\nThere you go and Slayer of dragons yeah that yeah okay sir go right ahead [laughter] well ties in\nTo the radio today at work when you're going to happen and they both play average rock and I live on the way in and on and I've been hearing advertise for your strength setting them up\nAnd of course I you know what I hear one side with him and said that she supported

sure everything is [laughter]\nAll right here's what I'm going to do a George since I did research this debate um a few weeks ago it's it's um it's not something I I Know cold off the top of my head I know what the piece of legislation was about\nAnd I remember a a political or a fact check on both the claims so will you do me a favor of of letting me respond to it in full tomorrow just so I have all the research and get it right\nSo little okay okay okay I I Will do that um [noise] it is interesting though that um and I'm I'm I'm Glad\nYou I'm I'm Glad you brought up that at in in this sense I have noticed that\nGrant woods who's the former attorney general for the state of Arizona He was a Republican\nFor many years he is now doing ads for Kirsten cinema and on this issue or you know basically trying to establish her book or speak to her bona fide he's on being tough on crime because he was tough on crime\nAnd it gets me to something I've had on my files here for about a about two weeks that I wanted to get too which is\nUm an op ed grant woods gave a wrote for the Arizona Republic about why he might run for Senate as a Democrat he's basically switching parties\nAnd I want to get into that too I Know this is what you called about but I think it's a it's it goes to a bigger issue about what he wrote in the Arizona Republic as to why he would be switching parties and why he might run for Senate\nUm so you've you've raised two two things begin this question that I'm grateful to you for that I I I I just want to lay publicly down as a as a bookmark\nI don't want to forget and I want to I Want the audience to hold me accountable on 'cause I have a lot to say about that\nAlso\nAll right so this ... this is a big thank you [laughter] I'm George thank you by the way I'm before you go do you have an inclination as to who you're going to vote\nFor in a in that race and the cinema and the cinema Mick Sally race\nSalad all the way OK okay and then but\nI just like in looked at all sure\nYou know because it has been the defense whatever they say yes it's just strange but today\nFair enough fair enough thank you George\nThank you says a barrel and you know\nYou're kind of man they're kind of say it will be will I Will address the sinful tomorrow thank you George much appreciated Stevens in Tempe welcome Steve\nHow are you man\nWhich does change parties I never liked him anyway as a Republican so\nIt's an odd Republican you know first of all I Hope he memories are a little longer than um than than than than three weeks ago or four weeks ago you know he um he popped up four years ago\nLoudly strongly vociferous Leon and and and ubiquitous sleep\nOn behalf of the Democratic party challenger Doug do see for devolve friend of all was the Democrat who ran against Doug do see in the general election four years ago and grant would create ads for Fred Deval\n... so you know once you start doing that\nOr you ... you have to start asking yourself what kind of a Republican is this person anyway\nKeeping in mind a couple of things um and they're not whether you call it about this or not doesn't matter I'll give you all the time you want but I just this this gets under my skin is people who aren't really playing it straight with the American people or the voters in this case Arizona and voters\nUm you know he holds himself out as a Republican but he ... he was doing big ads for devolved and\nIt's not as if Doug do see\nIs some kind of\nUm what's what's the word I Want some kind of aspirational Republican Doug do see is as straight down the middle a businessman commonsense oriented Republican as you can find it's not as if you don't know it's not as if this guy was some kind of earthquake or some kind of audacity to the Republican Party\nAnd then I remember interviewing grant woods about this wasn't a very good interview I wouldn't wanna replayed it may be one of the few interviews in my history I'm just actually not very proud of but it it it went off the tracks a little bit but\nI remember when it boils down to what I asked him to lay out why he as a Republican would endorse I'm Fred Deval a Democrat you know what his first answer was we were college roommates\nWell there are some great principal isn't it that's just a wonderful principle to encourage other people to vote for because of who your college roommate was I guess when you're in the party where you think what you did in college matters [laughter]\nI suppose yeah just the lottery ... ship ... should affect everyone else's vote\nIn one state Bill Clinton lie yeah yeah that's a good point [laughter] sure\nYeah I I I'm pretty\nSure five did not vote for Bill [laughter] although he might now Bill Clinton did fight for a return favor I think he he helped him out didn't need is in my memory right on that didn't Bill Clinton a commute five ... or something like that you know anyway sorry to go off on that tangent for a moment but go ahead so\nI don't think I did want to but I I might want to it's a great name what is it ... it says\nOh yes yes yes wait wait wait right the beginnings of Facebook yes yes I've seen it yeah yes\nOkay um there was a scene at

you're one of a dog that's very kind of you to say we have a great audience I think it's one of the hardest embezzling most fun audiences but you're one of them thank you\nWell yeah but but I Do now having said that I Do want to complain I felt a little emotional labor trade because a few weeks back we do you ever been talking about her\nBook club and we had went over some movies and then the following week we're going to do book and the uh having\nYou talk about the verdict and after the mail after someone else and all that your great things I was thinking\nOh wait a minute we have books coming up and by the way I'd I followed through and that the book or drawing life absolutely wonderful read\nYou read it happened I absolutely that is is it is it not a magnificent piece of work oh\nIt's absolutely phenomenal and how he he wanders back and forth through the trivial to the to the deep a just a wonderful easy read\nIf some wonderful education in western civilization and you could do it I don't know how long it took you to read I I uh you could do it in one night if you wanted to\nIs important so it's amazing you can get liberals to agree with the you know a good sixty percent if you go back to principles yeah\nI was thinking about that Doug a little bit and I was thinking over the break so for those that might just be joining us the question was you know in a social setting dinner or lunch some reception or other\nWhere you're just going to be social you're going for the dinner the launch a social reception\nAnd politics gets brought up from someone who's so fundamentally you disagree with their disagrees with few someone just to put a starkly who will who will who else analogize uh between Adolf Hitler let's say in Donald Trump which I hear a lot of\nUh lately a and everyone in this audience is certainly familiar with that um do I just clam up and try and keep a social or do I do I go at it\nUm I I more often than not trying to just keep it social because part of my thought process is I you know someone who thinks that it is it's not going to be convinced but\nAs I was thinking over the break dug and are listening to you now I I like your idea about ... ...\nWhen you add it directly and maybe the way of doing that and maybe my temporary\nAnswer is not talking about the Donald Trump are talking about the analogy part you know\nLet's say they bring up Adolf Hitler let's talk about eight or ... you could you could say you know Adolf Hitler\nUm put people in ovens you know\nHe invaded other countries and put their people\nIn ... um that's\nThat's what you're talking about maybe just start there maybe start there and then I I I'm guessing because you know I I've been around enough as you have I'm guessing their response\nWill not be to argue that point\nBut will then shift with okay but how did it start you know what were the conditions a debt Adolf Hitler exploited what were the process season means he used\nTo gain power and to do that sort of thing and aren't we seeing it now and then they'll you know unload a couple of examples where ... ...\nAnd I would respond you know you know that's an outstanding point one of the things I learned as the best thing my dad always as before you disagree always agree acknowledged the point ... you know so I Would say you know hey thanks so much for bringing up that's a really good point and then allowed really but then I Would say\nOne of the things I Would like to think about and and I really love to hear your opinion\nIs that when the Hitler began to\nUm impose his will because the Nazis or the national socialist\nWorkers Party he began to consolidate power and he took power away from the individual and gave it to the state\nIn in this situation we have an individual and I'm not saying whether you agree with him or not we have a situation in Iraq you can explain to me how he's doing and I'd love to hear it but he's basically\nPromising to dissolve power\nFrom the state and he's giving it back he is getting rid of regulations keep cutting the federal power so I ... and I understand your point but you need to explain to me I Need to understand that please help me understand because I see in willing in the opposite direction\nShe was going to become a Nazi he would have to consolidate power ... from the federal government to pause and uh so help me out with that\nPerhaps yeah I mean I ... Hitler's a unique one but he's also the easiest one the left brings up I mean it they don't usually do stall and they don't usually do\nYou know other monsters in in in history it's it's everything is for duct geo at Hitler and for the most part um you know I I think my answer would be okay what were the conditions well first of all Hitler wrote them out I'm a good ten years before he went\nTo ... you know before he came to power he wrote a book\nYou know yeah there was there was a book outlining his views on on you know Jews and and others um that that there was that template and and of course there's a southern downplayed which was the kind of democracy\nOr why mar Germany was which is not the kind of the democracy America is but oddly enough\nWith your views on the electoral college might be the kind of democracy you're trying to push us to\nMaybe maybe that would be a direction I'm I'm Still split on what I'll do even engage it but maybe that is more right is\nIt is tough because here's here's what I was going to get it very difficult and that's why the only way I ever been able to carry on a conversation as a quick or talking about abortion I pull it away from abortion that talk about\nUh the philosophical point and you know then they're open because here's the problem we're up against [noise] and it started ... years and years ago and it's just strengthened them become more rabbit is that\nWhen you have one side abused the left as incorrect or wrong or doesn't understand the point so we try to discuss it the left has more and more just basically if you listen to it and all their rhetoric\nEverybody is evil mhm and so when you apply\nEvil to something that's when you can get angry and they're bringing your vote for whatever philosophical discussion on one for if I'm really evil probably the faithful and ... there's no there's no um dignity you should give me\nThe most that's that's for sure Doug ... and and and and I think it's worth keeping\nIn mind so much of the left does wants to shut us off they don't want to engage a that's why they censor\nThat's why they take us off social media that's why they don't allow us on campuses to DePaul University just sand campus so an incredible these places don't have a right to call themselves places of higher learning much less universities [noise]\nI'm south leaps and we'll be right back Doug thank you

former vice president Dick Cheney and former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld and I asked them both to tell me their number one regret\nMost of the same thing we didn't fight back when we were accused of lying into the war of Iraq when people were chanting Bush ... people died we just knew that the American people were not going to believe it's we just ignored it\nIt was a huge mistake from which the Republican Party in my opinion has never recovered Bush ... people died is one of the most agree just defamation of president I have ever heard\nAnd yet the majority of Democrats to this day believe that George W. Bush widest into that war\nWhy because the Republicans did not fight back\nRepublicans did not remind the electorate we've got sixteen at the time intelligence agencies guess what all six seats sixteen said that Saddam Hussein has stockpiles of WB and they also at the highest level of certainty there's no such thing as a hundred percent\nThere was a category something called something like\nThe highest level the probability of the highest level of certainty all sixteen said that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles to a higher level of certainty and yet the left said Bush lied people died\nGeorge W. Bush retain the same director of the CIA George Tenet who served under Bill Clinton she gave both president the same intelligence the assertion that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of WMD was quote a slam dunk quote unquote\nAnd steal the left said Bush lied people died and Republicans did not fight back\nWas accused of essentially genocide because of his so called floated sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina few didn't push back\nSpike Lee the director said that he wouldn't put it past Bush to have intentionally blowing up the levees to flood in Orleans blacks would leave\nBarney Frank longtime democratic member of the house holding hearings she said\nGeorge W. Bush engage in ethnic cleansing by inaction close quote\nAre the what the hell that meant but he said\nThis president it fights back he called Maxine Waters low IQ can you imagine any Republican president saying anything like that deathly afraid of being called a racist not this president she fights back\nMedia Research Center looking at the ABC NBC nightly news coverage in the last several months\n\nSomething like Ninety four percent negative\nWhich is pretty much been the percentage of negative coverage of ABC NBC CBS nightly news since the beginning of his presidency\nAnd ABC NBC CBS still have a great deal of power they average about seven million viewers per channels less about Twenty one million people every single night\nWe'll hear news about the president is Ninety four percent negative this president has fought back with the term fake news\nTo the point where this so called bombshell article in the front page of New York times about the crime syndicate that Fred Jay Trump and his family had engaged in\nHit the\nMedia came out and hit a side\nThose who don't think much of Trump still don't think much of\nThose who support him and he is more popular than any Republican over a sustained period of time that I've ever seen among Republicans it didn't matter because the president has so successfully branded the New York times as fake news and it's having a vendetta against him\nThat whatever they say now has a heavy heavy discount just as a newspaper that has not endorsed a Republican for president since Nineteen fifty six\nThe Washington Post has never endorsed you're a Republican for president never\nThis president is fighting back this president is calling them out for what they are\nWhen you have people like Don Lemon who calls himself a journalist going on TV saying quote the president is a racist I'm just saying if you guys already knew it in the ...\nWhen you have so called journalists like Anderson Cooper telling Jeffrey lowered

a band yeah you could take those comments that maybe are said even maybe comments you hurt\nYou know the obviously you know that you're more involved in politics if things\nAre than I Am but uh the the the hatred out there yeah uh uh from politics it's a perfect example of what you're talking about and I think you know not to get political here\nBut it's just my experience that I see if if if someone were to ask me or if or meet me\nAnd then take a guess if I'm a conservative or liberal more Republican or Democrat however you want to put it yeah I'm people could probably guess what I Am just from my mood grief [laughter] three yeah isn't that interesting no I\nI think it is and and and it's why conservatives generally are happier people\nPut ... yes and some people do you deal better with pressure 'cause I Do have a lot of things going on if I I oftentimes have to check my own sanity because of all the projects and all the different things that I Do plus I'm helping ... with their own financial issues that they're facing a and\nI have my own as well right I take chances and risks maybe with my money and do things that I Do by investing here or there lending money out to friends or family or whatever it might be\nUm ... so there is stressed and everything that we all do it how\nDo we handle that stress and that's very difficult and I don't know how people are wired that there are certain things that people I guess can can withstand uh emotionally but it's very difficult to keep emotion Adams some of these things for some people and I think ... where\nAre you have to try to find a way to take a motion out of the decisions that you make so my decision is not an emotional decision for me to say I'm just going to be happy it's that's somehow in my in my nature in my makeup I'm able to do that and\nMaybe put some of those negative things that I'm dealing with throughout the day or somewhere back in my brain and come back to them later well\nIt's a gift than to you I read a study unhappiness or isn't that like me [laughter]\nI read a study on a happiness a few years back I'll never forget it said that certain uh every one is born with a set point for a certain set point in their demeanor some are born to the dark some are born to light\nBut those who are not born perhaps with the constitution of such outward cheerful and is an inward a contentment\nAs someone like yourself John there are things you can do to get there and um and you can improve on your set point by several standard deviations one of them one of them is engaging in charitable acts not a surprise properly anyway\nI think another sets could be who do you hang around with yeah absolutely you know if you if you were hanging around people that are constantly complaining about everything you may become a habitual complainer yourself absolutely\nI mean one of Aristotle definitions of friendship is someone who makes you a better person and uh you know you can hang out with the right crowd you can hang out with the wrong crowd this is the job of parents to instruct their children on on who won which is where ...\nAnd then eventually you could become that mentor and maybe that's the person that people look up to his you know I don't I don't at all strive for that what I Do is I I really do try to look at every one situation and if there's something I can do to help them to work with them not\nYou know not try to tell them what to do but really to help them work with them especially with finances that's what I Do I'm I'm a financial coach right ... you could say and I've got to be a in a position find at ... I should say mentally and emotionally if I'm going to help others\nNice ... now it's a good point [noise] All right John I appreciate your given us a little extra time and a little extra of yourself

to be able\nTo accept the result election right so that was my point and you know go back to that is it just strikingly ironic where we're at now\nWell Hillary talk about that still oddly enough she talks about Trump's answers still\nShe says that left her breathless when he said he wasn't sure or whatever his answer was that was the best solution and uh she said Trump threatens democracy by not accepting the the result by not saying he would accept the results of the election necessarily believe it was their last debate\nUm look who's accepted and who hasn't and who's marching with not my president and who isn't\nI mean look up to us and who has\n[noise] it is very obvious it's very obvious and I think there's a lot of people by doing service either very well on those people I'm Around

Institute author of numerous books on American politics\nAnd um [noise] has a piece up at American greatness a today\nThat is titled Harry Jaffe on Kevin ... and the crisis of America Divided listeners to this show no that ah one of the teachers have changed my whole life and world and on and my ... but when I Am one of the most important political philosophers\nOf the modern era was a Harry Jaffe who passed away a couple of years ago twenty Fifteen\nAnd he wrote a lot on constitutional interpretation he wrote a lot on\nUh the influence of the declaration of independence not only in our legal reasoning but in its proper place in American politics and Ken took the opportunity to look at the Kavanaugh hearings and what Harry Jeff I might have thought or said about them as well as the jurisprudence\nOf now justice Kevin a doctor I'm assuming You're welcome back\nWhich I've never heard a radio host used the word penultimate\n[laughter] well you know what I Do in the end to the ... in the third to west our I say anti porn ultimate oh heavens [laughter]\nWe we we have a lot of fun with words here I think on this show so far today ah we've we've used penultimate we use anti personal to me we've even used still cast it oh heavens yeah be because we're all methodology just now aren't we [laughter]\n\nWe were out on nothing [laughter]\nCan um this is heady stuff what you got into it American greatness um and it's some of the most uh interesting stuff in conservative political philosophy I think\nI'd go from ... to stuff how's that and um I I I Would like you to reprise what you wrote a little bit and starting with the judicial philosophy of our great teacher Harry Jaffe folk who would have turned one hundred years old this month right\nYes or just on the weekends he would have 'em and [noise]\nHis model is an example for all of those\nUm I don't think about a new judiciary and\nThe greater questions or the judiciary turns us true namely the meaning of the constitution end of the count constitutions grounding\nIn natural natural rights and the great western tradition of well both philosophy and scripture\n... and ... those were the polls are just as large as understanding or we're human beings are situated between philosophy scripture\nAnd go wherever they live uh in and for us Americans here in the United states and all the traditions and I'm issues that come with being an American\nRight and on top of that a central teaching of Jeff and I believe probably received from his teacher Leo Strauss\n... was the notion um how to put it well I I guess you put it well that politics is not a low enterprises it's not it's not a dirty or degrading enterprise it's actually a or can be I should say it can be a source for our highest human aspirations\nUh that's right and uh obviously we need to be reminded of that given the load some of the past few weeks the Humvees of a vicious attacks on a now justice Kavanaugh\nOr we need to be reminded that uh our constitution and the declaration of independence on Richard grass or serve Potter purposes\nUm and I think the cabinet nominations can bring a reminder service and in a way that may be very disturbing to us at first because I think Jeff\nUh we we have to recall it ... it was very critical of some of conservatives ... most I'm honored here\nSo yeah this is an important this is where we get complicated and I want to I Want to give you full full time to do that yes Harry Jaffa a conservatives conservative educator of so many great conservatives author of Barry Goldwater's most famous speech\nShe and blood say the Robert Bork San Anton ... some of the world did not agree\nYes and um this is very important and it's important to keep in mind first of all that I'm Jeff ... was fond of of virtually all of these conservative justices opinions ... goalie is right\nOr just a buddy he was very critical of how they did it that is um the reasoning they used to come to those conclusions because in a word you can say all of these Greek conservatives and I I don't think he would have excluded cabinet all\nThe books for one possible Chevy that'll get into\nUm [noise] they were all legal positive ... which means that uh they simply took the constitution and all the laws were passed under it and accept them as as long as they were they meant the a superficial a uh\nCast of having been legitimately passed\nIn other words not directly in contradiction with the first amendment or something like that tight there are some right to\nServe like a a a law banning uh books\nBy Plato exactly exactly um [noise] so\nUm\nWhat what ... Jaffer did was go through very carefully the writings and some of the opinions of these justices and showed\nA really how absurd and frankly all American they really were when you contrast them with but ah the history of the founding the declaration of independence and how the founders\nUnderstood the text that\nUh these distinguished jurors are sought to interpret I'm Andy he really caught these people are on some very silly point um and uh really showed that a\n... and it's not that these are people are are stupid or evil or quite the contrary it just showed the limits of law schools and what\n... and what law schools do and what these great and then did the Scalia's and the\n... and and the Borg so many others is based in a sense they transcended they're bad educations\nAnd um some of them and intern were very great teachers all the law and and and they did a superb job is as justices but Jeff always insisted on pushing a\nPublic figures whether it was a blanket that he wrote so much about or or these justices or any one senator or it wouldn't matter\nUm to their limit a judge Judy all too much not to put an alternate but maybe ... right and to use to try to use them as models which\nMeant treating them as bill people writing with the same seriousness civil philosopher and the their writings deserve to be a analyzed with as much chair and when he did that uh their work simply fell apart\nOr because they didn't meet the luster of a of the greatest works of western civilization I mean and and ... and and so we had to so I'm a\nJazz folk pointed out their their deficiencies and of course she wasn't appreciated by their defenders in the legal profession and in some cases directly by the terrorists themselves\nJaffa would be um would describe I well I don't know if you would if if there's a certain kind of jurisprudence you would describe himself but maybe it would be the best phrase that we can come up with him we saw a glimpse of it in the Thomas Clarence Thomas hearings\nAre the what was basically you might say natural law philosophy or natural a jurisprudence that incorporates the natural law uh as as as invoked by the declaration of independence and understanding of the constitution I'm fair enough\nThere yes you're absolutely right\nAnd how would one do that or how would you summarize that theory because that's what juxtapose is er that's what's up against the positive law in ... one of the ... here is\nThat one has to understand the constitution in light of the declaration a and that that\nMoral framework is the basis for political and legal [noise] um [noise] an degree [noise] counter example [noise] a great country example is the Dred\nThe Q and a day that she was sitting in front of a flag of uh the University of Maryland I pointed out there were two\nCrosses in that [laughter] and so did he feel uh his um a conscience was violated by a sitting in front of a flag with two Christian symbols\nAnd he looked back at the flag incredulous lay and then he snarled at me and said oh you're one of these people who believe that America is a Christian nation\nRented on life [laughter] um well up here but I think ultimately Jaffa would've defendant Kavanaugh if only because I I Believe is the only American Justice too was born on February twelfth yes Lincoln's portrait yeah as a result of a\nShower again with all kinds of Lincoln's writings and I I'm sure a cabinet has a history major or would have appreciated them\nAnd Kavanaugh did talk a lot during the hearings about his views of brown versus board and plus ... versus Ferguson interestingly enough\nI'm while it would be um accurate I supposed to say that brown versus board of education over turned plus he because that's exactly what the justices said it did not\nIncorporate the dissenting opinion and plus C which is what so bothers so many of us natural laws jurists yeah right yeah\nI get Carlin's opinion is very solid on that point it disturbs some conservatives because um it it seems to go too far I'm In a direction that opens up the thirteenth amendment\nTo to justify any crazy a socialist doctrine that someone comes up with a ... that is that a ... a capitalism is a form of slavery\nRight Obama's a point a chairman of the civil rights commission's seem to be saying\nRight right\nSo we're we're not for nonsense like that we will slavery when we see it\nAnd but we also know the nonsense of modern psychology when we see it which is what in the brown versus board was really based on that was one of ... complaints about it\nWas you know psychological trends and measurements and studies can change but human the human nature and human miss cannot\nWrite and that that's behind some of these prayer decision he has\nAll those that they they're uh they inflict psychological trauma around and therefore they have to be ah they they must be unconstitutional\nWell he was so opened up an inter such an interesting a line of argument that as lay dormant or in so many months for so long that I pasture article said two of my favorite a legal scholars in town here can just so you know and they immediately\nBoth of whom no of

during and even after the Kavanaugh hearings and since it does raise an interesting um\nA dengue them to the question we were struggling with a bit yesterday of the question we were wrestling with a bit yesterday which was when you're in the ... when you're in a social gathering in in the presence of a committed\nA leftist or is it is who's analogies are are you know a range from the comparison
