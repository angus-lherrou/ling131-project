so thank you I'm delighted to be back here\nFor um as I said the last time I was on the program trends was established in Nineteen eighty two I went to work for the newspaper at the time\nIn Nineteen Ninety four and then subsequently purchase it at the end of two thousand\nAnd turned it into a magazine and we cover all the society things that happened in Phoenix pretty much\nFrom the end of October to the end of may and it goes to twenty four thousand readers when you do a lot of good charitable work too I like to point that out as well to each other we have a very great foundation and

charitable fund dot com either one\nPerfect thinking ... sorry no that's fine that's fine now we do movie talk here you wanted to do a disaster movies but before we do disaster movies before we get to it I have to play you some audio that I think will be some surprise audio for it you know I Hope you like this because the last time you were here build you have or what I Want to hold that just one sec\nLast time you were here you and I talked about one or two years in the Academy Awards which portrayed\nJust an amazing distinction between the kinds of movies Hollywood used to be capable of putting out this and ... the kind of what's the word I Want I think ... they put out now in direct might be Iraq a rising tide of mediocrity [noise]\nUh I took one year which I liked which was um [noise] Nineteen sixty three the movies of Nineteen sixty three where you got all in one year you got Lawrence of Arabia the longest day mutiny on the bounty to kill a mocking bird\nThe miracle worker um sweet bird of youth bird man of Alcatraz Billy Budd this is a days of wine and roses this was all one year measuring candidate all in one year right that unbelievable unbelievable the host that\nYear of the Academy Awards with Frank Sinatra us he opened the Academy Awards with this have you heard it I was hoping to surprise you with it it's fun even if you have maestro take it away\n[noise] before we get on a big one I'd like to take this opportunity\nSo to speak so just to say as a way to fix it is I Want to have a little tired of all of the talk of editorials called what's wrong with Hollywood unquote sick about airing of run away for\nThe U.S has cost the star system and how we need to go in the subsidies I Know\nAnd you know we need to ... and the way to get pictures are rather\nRather legally headed early in the evening if you get back into the Mona Lisa ... individual pictures had in a fashion chair individual picture ... committees\nAccountants lawyers office boys ... is really the real estate ... by ...\n[noise]\n... going through all those paper on your front lawn\nAnd when you turn to the end the famous section they will be an ad which raises a best picture of the way out about the rights that are now to help us write it\nWe decided on a friend's house lifelong in Tokyo\nNaturally we had a choice of all of the French housewives on and so [noise]\nWhat's that show also asked the winter we\nHad a daily level first of all listen to each his own and then the virus got 'em in the Soviet\nWasn't that fun that was less than that just have making good picture as\nWell and I have to say to only Frank Sinatra could say this because if somebody disagreed with him he'd have their legs\n[laughter] making good extras I Love that I just thought that audio is fun and what a great wind up to introducing Olivia to have on this disaster films you want to talk about why do you want to talk about disaster for his I think that\nThey're very profound I think that they really shaped our culture in the Nineteen seventies and made us aware of things that we had really never thought of or experience before and I really think it was just completely earth shaking and very culturally significant you made me watch\nSomething I'm not you but because I knew this was the topic I decided to watch some to bone up on a couple I haven't seen and I guess it's fair to say that disaster movies really did start in the Nineteen seventies as best I can tell\n'em I don't know if we can precisely defined them maybe it's so you know when you see it [noise] but I took to uh watching uh the Poseidon adventure\nUh the towering inferno\nUh I'll think of a couple of others I watched those two would certainly be amongst the first to anyone would think of wouldn't they\nI Would think so I think earlier if you look at 'em Arthur Haley's novel a airport airport we ... we all watched airport was really I went back and I researched airline disaster movies of the Nineteen fifties and sixties and they really showed very little\nAbout what took place in an airline disaster\nRoss Hunter was on the more with the decompression seen an airport you watch that and it's it's terrifying now is it was in Nineteen Seventy one van half one went into the restroom and let the bomb\nThat was terrifying and you know who knew van half one would end up looking like [laughter]\nIt's very well no not a it was one of his last pictures has had to have been a no we watched airport one of the things that was interesting about that movie uh well you know all of them frankly is how much slower\nThose movies are there out they are also action movies how slow them to build up is compared to what were we got used to in the eighties and nineties much now it's a much so you have to have a lot more patience airport is not an action movie\nNo nah it is sort of a disaster movie [laughter]\nIt is indeed well everything is so quick reflects now we want everything instantly right films have to be faster than they were back in Nineteen Seventy one airport was produced and good old marine Stapleton Airport a shoe who was his wife right at scene you know when\nShe sees the seven to seven pulled back from the terminal and she realizes there's nothing she can do and she just stands there heartbroken knowing that her husband as a terrorist I I still get chills I think it's one of the finest scenes in movie ever\nIt is and there's another scene in there which\nStirs up so many things in me it's the scene of there's I don't know if he's a famous actor or not but it's the character who's complaining about everything I think he complains about stale not just [noise]\nAnd um he's the guy who ruins the whole thing to see I have a theme in life or be where the dampers it comes from a Canadian novelist be where the damn person cynics in society\nUm they're bad this guy is nothing but a damper on a complainer and when the team or on the airline on the airplane the team puts together a really good plan\nTo take the bomb away from van half one is its in its brief case\nThis guy interferes interferes my you can't take this man's property and\nYou know that just trust the authorities the distrust of the government the cynic the complainer the Mr helper it's All right there and that guy who ruins everything well it it it builds up with a complaint about fell not costing lives\nJust and then of course there's the famous scene where the gentleman comes out of the restroom and van ... jumped in and the guy who's complaining goes grab him he's got a bomb\nThat's right freaks out the entire airplane he twice ruins yeah\nHeck of a cast Burt Lancaster dean Martin Jacqueline beset George Kennedy\nI'm Helen Hayes who always looks like that I mean that was just classic killing Hayes obviously a marine Stapleton and Gary Collins people remember him as a talk show host us but he was that like third flight attendant of ... third pilot\nHit so big and the seventies because Americans realized for the first time yes eight plane can have a mad bomber on it yes a cruise ship turnover yes a high rise ... can cut catch on fire and yes there can be a big shark and a big\nEarthquake I read somewhere I don't know if you have any recollection of this but I read somewhere that the initial making of jaws the initial ah the the initial screenwriter kept talking about a whale kept talking about a whale ... kept having to tell them it was a shark it was a shark shark\nI have heard that and um people didn't know much about sharks until that book or a movie they really didn't know all about so now it's amazing to think about the people really didn't have much interaction or thought about sharks until then\nMy first interaction with sharks um the Brophy family had a large home in rocky point and there was a coffee table book I think it was written by Jacques Cousteau if I'm not mistaken and it was called blue water white deaths and it was about great white sharks will\nWe flip through the book we looked at the color pictures but we never gave it any thought until that winter I Believe it was Nineteen Seventy four when the novel jaws came out that would be about right the movie was Seventy five spellbinding yeah spellbinding\nIn it changed the way everyone looked at oceans forever more or\nBeaches I should I think anything I mean I've been a swimmer all my life and I won't swimming in the open water now because of jaws right I don't even like the deep end of our swimming pool\nNights but that's the\nImpact the difference with Charles as opposed to the side and eventually the towering ... people will go into big buildings after the ... watching the towering foreign oh gosh knows why\nAnd they'll go on cruise ships after the Poseidon adventure and they won't think about those movies but I don't think anyone goes into an ocean without thinking a little bit about the movie jobs just a little bit\nI think you're right I think it stays there permanently on your head just a little bit think of how long ago that was now and it's still a say over forty years us absolutely\nRight absolutely right talk to me about the towering in far for no\nThis was a heck of a cast this was a real cast Fred Astaire to Paul Newman to go for\nIt on and on I mean it was ... I think that Ross Hunter with the success of airport established the all star cast where you just loaded with Academy Award winners and seasoned veteran actors\nMcQueen Steve McQueen Irwin Allen did this with the Poseidon adventure and then he just hit pinnacle what the towering inferno to pair Steve McQueen and Paul Newman together who had been complete arch rivals who most people\nAssumed were almost the same person they had such a similar look\nI Do have a similar though did he ... he must have died shortly thereafter\nSteve Steve McQueen died in Nineteen eighty OK okay lung cancer we had a few more years smoker um he he tried that Africa ... craze thing do you remember that thing yes and I might mayoral or lead to rile where they thought oh yeah yeah indeed\nI I think of as Harry inferno the performances were fantastic I think some were better than others you and I toss when we're off the era of Robert Wagner ensues and plan or you know\nI mean ... when they discover after sneaking away I Believe the pretext was they were both supposed to be up in the party something like that are messing around yeah messing around has been around so they smell smoke yeah\nHe goes out to savor burned to death and she crashes opened the high rise window and then an explosion pushes or out or when Alan loved to kill women or\nYou go back and look at his movies there are they fell out of glass elevators they fell on a ranch on something or some of these beautiful women will always being killed\nMight've been OJ Simpson for [noise] believe it was a ... throw him in there too and then of course all Newman OJ Simpson Richard Chamberlain\nAs Susan blob or Avon citizens are Jones a stabbing they call them and it goes on and on\nAnd on [noise] we'll be right back six zero to five

Telhami about but I don't know the movie at all about a ballet dancer and an over controlling mother\nIs it's a fine film it's very very dark and it's a few years older years old by bleak ending but very very dark\nWell these are oh this is Natalie Portman yes ha ha ha ha ha ha gotcha okay great uh if you wanted to recommend to our audience good political movies uh that would be a good category for us to talk about as well\nA lot of people will start with um with the candidate Robert Redford with Robert Redford which is I think okay a lot of people don't remember but I think maybe the better movie was the one with Ellen elder what\nWas it the education of do you know this one where he was he was the United states senator a tend to all the education all think of it in a second the ... ... ... I think that is a better movie but I I start people I think I I think it's worth starting\nPeople off with um with the Robert Redford a Robert Redford Dustin Hoffman movie about Watergate I think all the President's Men is a great political but\nIt is to find some I Would go back further I'd go back into the Nineteen fifties and start with it\nWill actually uh I'm Sorry where I'm decade early Nineteen sixties\nThe manager and candidate okay an advise and consent advise and consent is a tremendous number money film or the ... cat was kinda band for a little bit wasn't it wasn't allowed to come out when it was first made right because of this was ... very Frank Sinatra right\nUm and that was just remade recent Janet Leigh and generally and this was this was a remake rights that lousy lousy remake everything was remade as we discuss last week with the exception my opinion of Cape Fear was lousy\nCape Fear was a pretty good ... fear was better than the original as any other remake better than the original other than Cape Fear that's uh that's that's hard because you know what's\nWhat's also a bit of a political movie a bit um everyone will will say well what about Mr Smith goes to Washington okay but uh I I think it's a wonderful life has political under tones that are pretty interesting very much so I think it does I I think it is that still a great movie um\nBut you know the audience my audience is you know conservative as it is a doesn't have a lot of love for um who all the President's Men have become a source but it is a good movie it is and it is instructive\nTo the press today which all of them want to be Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein but none of them are they don't do the work that was depicted in that book or that movie um you know\nIf there was a use of anonymous source it was certainly double and triple quadruple checked and they really did do leg work when you watch what journalists used to do to get a story it's a lot different\nDo you remember there in the stacks and they're in phone books I mean it's just it was real journalism what was the recent film with Meryl Streep and I'm at a loss for words I just thought regarding her relationship with um\nShe plays Katharine Graham oh right this is a I I didn't know that movie came out I heard about it I heard about it was coming out a very good political so it is a good political film okay this is the one about the Pentagon papers interesting one of the things I was I'm told about the film 'cause I haven't seen it was\nThat it ... and if you saw you you would know better that it was an effort at some point to evidently in the film to um make Nixon the villain and you know next and was suing to or his ... his ... his department of justice was suing to stop the Pentagon papers\nA from being published but it was all about stuff that have taken place under the Johnson administration was trying to protect things that took place during the ... his admit he was trying to keep confidential the actions of the Johnson administration to protect the notion of national security and um and and more time national secrets and I don't know if that came\nThrough you saw it I don't think it came through yeah so it was it was certainly an anti Richard Nixon film I got a movie recommendation from a listener of artist named Andrew just came in seven days in may so when you're familiar with seen it I haven't either so let's look it would have to watch yeah we have to watch\nSeven days in may [noise] um no the um that was the funny thing about the Pentagon papers is a is that uh as I was as I was a study in the case in\nLaw school you know we're all thought and taught in law school\nTo think of Nixon is the villain and Nixon is the runaway Justice Department but it was a a an effort by him to protect national security secrets that were committed before he became president and he was really truly trying to\nEffort the protection of classification of classified

I think it was dumb ass\nAnd he said he pulled up to the post op San Juan heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office and the clerk and Steve Allen's the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the car says where's your number\nAnd Steve Allen says I don't have a number he says well you'll have to go back to not much we can freeze the box always it back plus I Want you know those numbers like you might get it a bakery or at a deli counter something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with a heavy box walked up to the counter he's the only one there and the postal clerk says Thirteen call says number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you've got to give them credit or seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job [noise]\nUm but seriously it never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are well I don't you know President Trump says we have the best and the ...\nI think in in in this case you notice around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like that but you know last plane lost ships whatever it was called the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people\nWhich by the wayside was why are so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department engage in a soft coup I think a lot of people knowledge that now against the legitimately elected president of United States Donald Trump\nOr unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular Asians those would be the worst day in and day out in the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so disgraceful to see those in power tarnish the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI no we do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know as soon as you're being so tarnished and so ruined because someone you engaged in an old like a banana republic activities that's why we were unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them [noise]\nSo what are the suspect winds up being someone with deep mental issues\nOr someone who's just evil\nThe fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that\nNeedless to say these type of acts can do irreparable damage to our political system\nAnd the you know you don't you know on the line I think of what the uh the Hillary Clinton people in the left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disasters someone should be pointed that out\nWhen he tried to do the political system is what you guys already with the political system and trying to get legitimately elected as a president or impeached\nNo one can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn it this is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is off and it looks like we do loans sure looks like what did he have a stickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy such and want to be around no matter what side but it's ...\nWe all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those in the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor do they probably care that we were as unhappy with his election and the ... election of President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat would never dawned on them never never never dawned on them [noise]\nAfter all many of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the announcer was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally change the United states of America\nWe are middle class [noise]\nI'd always gotten it wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave us notice you ... for job you do give two weeks let us know ... days before at\nWhat previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that and which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected\nHistory has made one a leader steps up stays true to his values and sharks are fundamentally different course for the country\nThat's 'cause you're not in power when you get a power I Wonder if you agree that we should try a fundamentally different course when we get in power that he was talking about Obama I didn't even know that well he should have was right yeah [noise] and apologize for what you may know my sign up is always\nA pleasure privileged to have like front of the greatest history a country in the history of the world\nBut we're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House didn't lows actresses or singers threatened that like that march that day of or the day after whatever it was\nPrinted you see this in the New York times uh about the assassination of the current president I guess it's\nSupposed to be fiction obviously bought a gift you know we don't do that kind of stuff but the left and the Democrats and the press which is really the same thing\nHas never accepted as victory and will do anything to remove him from office that seems clear including blaming his rhetoric for the suspects violence which is where I'm going to go now even before anything they knew you know they didn't know much about the suspect\nSo this will be used and it's being used to hurt President Trump and the Republicans [noise] especially with the November elections just stays away [noise] so this guy did it because of what President Trump says that's what they'll have you believe [noise]\n[noise] so they're almost all on the left and we are fortunate to have someone like President Trump called them out\nWe've had so many we presidents in the past and it's absolutely refreshing to see someone take it back to that even if the media the left the Democrats can't take it President Trump is not responsible for the craziness\nThe country tell me what you think as I said eight eight eight nine seven one ... and let's try to get a caller to in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark you're on with mark Hi Mark\nAnd mark a mark on what you were a bringing up about a media is absolutely true they want to report the fact that this is a cycle and here's a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida light power and I I don't know some other bomb threats to\nSow what Trump responsible for though no he happens to be just you know the ... the ... you know and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up or anything or to set a few times during\nHis his uh his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times we said oh yeah go ahead you're on the face or something like that that was but he hasn't said anything like that where the the the law whether it's the the actual political people or the the news\nUh they've all actually says there are going out and confront them and and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so um again that's the part of the contrast and different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that oh of\nCourse it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well they'll they recognize it but they're not going to say than even most of the hard core I Would say\nYou know intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way if the Trump arrangements that I'm now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it does you know that's what they would say no question about it\nBreaking ATF news just recently in the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a

the price of oil over this trying to just attached to President Trump there's nothing they'll stop at to try to defeat him let's go to Pam in Dallas texas Pam you're on with mark\nAnd it just dawned on me I thought was driving and listening to what it's about to unravel and have have actually started\nYes and it would go back to what Dr ... eloquently and sad is that\nEven after chemotherapy you cannot say ensure that every single cancer cell is gone and so oftentimes when we go back and take the lead lumpectomy or mastectomy\nWe still see residual are leftover disease there so when we're assessing respond to treatment sell if somebody comes in and they've had their chemotherapy and they initially started off with a five centimeter math and we examine them and say you know at least we don't feel that math\nWe you can't really reliably say that every cancer cell is gone what you can say is that we don't feel anything and you've had a good response to your therapy but that doesn't equate to all of that being gone\nSo then let's reverse a Becker kind of go if someone has a mastectomy\n\n... y radiation after that great question\nThere are categories of patients who have had most stuck to me that don't need radiation therapy because their risk of a rip currents without radiation is very low single low single digits or we're not going to improve their outcome and we don't use radiation in that setting\nIs that based on a very mentality\nYes it's based on how well they do with surgery and whatever drug therapy Dr Kato chooses to give them some patients received the estrogen blocking drugs only some patients receive chemotherapy only some patients receive both\nAnd many of them do well after most stuck to me and there was no value to radiation but if that number is high enough if the numbers they over ten percent we start to consider using radiation because once the number the recurrence risk is over ten percent we can actually save lives by using radiation to prevent those recurrence\nDid you want to add anything back into\nNo that's exactly a good explanation\nAll right we've discussed locally advanced life stage disease in treatment\nLet's talk about stage for Dr kiddo what what\nIs staged for what are the prognosis what is the prognosis for stage four\nSo staged for is once a cancer has spread outside the breast for breast cancer it tends to go to the bone belong and the liver that is no longer a curable cancer but it's treatable\nAnd we have excellent medications to treat stage for breast cancer\nThe prognosis is different on everybody it really depends on your biology or if you're a tumor and then again the biology weather is a system put just from positive for her to positive because we have targeted therapy now for those type of breast cancer\nPrognosis or\nWith stage four eventually you'll die from your breast cancer and the reason we do radiation surgery and chemotherapy earlier stages is to prevent a patient to develop stage for D.C.'s\nOr that they always give you a number of five year survival rate but to be honest with you they lump all the breast cancer together I don't give a number you make your own journey and and your journey with breast cancer\n\nO M stage for\nDoctor Murthy is there\nAny good cause is there a benefit to doing surgery um someone with stage four so as far as because if it's\n\nOutside of the breast itself and we're doing surgery on the breast\nLike what a veil\nAnd that's a great question um antiseptic to a lot of debate a historically the answer was no unless they cancer was eating to their breast and became a wound problem or was bleeding and\nSo in those cases that was really the only indication or reason to do any type of surgical intervention which was generally a mastectomy however with great advancements better treatments\nAnd with better technology to even detect small amounts of matter of static disease patients are living longer with their disease\nAnd so there are some studies showing that maybe in those patients who have done so well to their therapy there systemic therapy and there does and their systemic disease or their their medicine addict disease has responded to that\nThat is there any value and going back and removing the primary breast cancer and so\nOn until they are I Would say better studies to show that that would be the best way to go it's really an individual um decision and every patient is different and so in general if a patient has made a static disease but they've had such a great response to their\nUm systemic therapy\nAnd they are in good health then we will remain the primary cancer\nAnd then back in time I Do a in states\nFor breast cancer radiation uh what are we trying to accomplish that point\nRadiation therapy for stage for breast cancer is used to\nControl problem areas or cash response in different parts of the body that could become a significant quality of life of fact\nI'm cause pain cause neurologic problems so the radiation is used artfully to try to control those spots before they become a problem occasionally someone will have met authentic disease and that's cancer that spread beyond the breast beyond the armpit on that side and beyond the low neck on that side\nEverything within those areas is still technically not met a static but if it spread beyond that but you're just one or two spots we sometimes treat those one or two spots with surgery and radiation depending on where they are with the hope that we can get that patient a good long interval before the catcher appears\nAgain when it comes to [noise] life stage or let's go beyond ... stage when it comes to stage for breast cancer any of you\nWhat do you want people to know that we haven't covered\nSo what I Want to do that was what I Want to know that uh we have\nNew treatments an excellent treatment for breast cancer\nOr for your PR a positive or we have brand new medications that double the response rate and you can live for years\nUm have you have hurt too we have excellent target therapy a force a triple negative we're doing clinical trials in immunotherapy a which are the newest thing and and and many a treatment of cancer at this time\nAh so ah there's a patients are living longer and longer with stage four breast cancer\n\nRight folks so before we go off the air I wanted to bring up a couple of things and uh one is uh\nRegarding the packages are sent out this past weekend discovered you know when you look at it and I'm not going to go into postage stamps that\nWorse or packages that were sent through the mail\nAnd yet the stamps were never canceled out there is no visual signs of that I'm not going into all the hip comes I just want to look at this\nThat when you look at the people that received packages and bombs isn't it amazing they're the same people that are considered such high profile they are the most visible and attacking our president has cabinet and every move his administration makes I'm also a realist\nAnd reality coupled with a few brain cells brings me to the logical collusion conclusion that this thing smells to I Am and keep in mind these people that have allegedly been targeted are the same people but it looks straightened to the cameras some years back and spoke clearly and microphones\nAbout health care program that would give government ever increasing control over your health they spoke stating that Obamacare would allow you to keep your insurance scarier keep your doctor Andrew ... premiums would definitely be lower\nThese people are the same people that were in government than and are active in that first to eliminate our president his efforts and they are ever obsessed with gaining power again\nThese are the same players that ran guns in fast and furious and then claimed executive privilege these are the same people that wound up being responsible or in a roundabout way for the death of border agent Brian uh\nJerry ... keep in\nMind that these people claimed executive privilege to keep the party from exploding sense of top of the Obama administration where the key players\nThese are the same group of people that bold in an innocent man jail dam and ruined him and his family's life by setting him up as a video producer that was blamed for the blood of four Americans\nNow and you said there was how much vitamin C. and your supersede twenty two four years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving so by by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that you'll

supersede twenty two formula with an extra free supply and you get Dr ... says audio CD the number to call is one eight hundred\nTo zero eight one nine six zero I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred to zero eight one nine six zero\n... just tuned in we have Dr Michael take us back in the studio with us today he's a leading authority on both natural and alternative health we've been talking about how critical vitamin C is in terms of overall health\nNow Dr fingers I got to ask the question I mean you know you you you've kind of talked a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough on them and see but you know the reality is that I'm sure I'm not getting enough item and see based on what you said I I I'm not arguing that point but the reality is that I'm Still standing\nI I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here\nI mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to be healthy\nWhen you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a dean minus because they're already a for vitamin C. it's sixty milligrams sixty military ... inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass and so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the right amounts and the right form in order to get yourself into a high level health or why why is that is so critical do why is getting enough fight 'em and see so critical\nJust to recap number one your body doesn't make it too is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least three thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per day vitamin C. you're going to be someone who is on multiple mates\nYou run into doctors you're got blood pressure problems you don't make the good cholesterol triglycerides are high you might be diagnosed with diabetes he of pain in your body you're looking at old and you're feeling old before you shouldn't be oh\nAll right well let's let's get into this a little bit then I mean can you talk about what's in your super see twenty two formula\nYeah what I have is first of all it's a powder that you mix into cold water okay and each serving is Fifteen hundred milligrams of vitamin C.\nOkay and it has twenty two different sources of vitamin C. which is very very important for your body what's the benefit of having those twenty two different sources well the benefit is is is that your body recognizes these from nature\nAnd there's there's a number of different sources from nature there's rose hips broccoli\nCertain type of cherry called an asteroid cherry lemons lines grapefruit with the supersede twenty two I've tried to duplicate what's in nature and I put it into one form I see okay well speaking of which can we can we make some yeah I Want to try it right here yeah okay All right now why why a powder instead of let's say a\nA pill or a capsule or something like that ... vitamin C. it's it's necessary to get it in your system not just in your blood but down to the tissues\nSo any more than a powder and you put water in it it activates it absorbs quickly this is the best way to get in your body\nIs ... is this most of his\nYeah the ... is showing that is activated the minerals and all the vitamins they're they're actually mixed in in the water\nOkay just keep makes up for a second All right All right let me let me try this [noise] [noise]\nOh that's really good it is good and then yeah it's like a ... taste as actual extremism fruits that I put in there to flavor really good at a good job Dr ... thank you thank you yeah\nPeople really enjoy the taste of it what I recommend Chris as you can actually mix up a bunch of it put in a service or a pitcher you can keep their fridge right or you can drink it throughout the day now ...\nYou know again I think most people myself included have always thought about vitamin C. um you know with respect to cold and flu and building up your immunity but you know you're talking about things that go way way beyond that so what about cardiovascular how how does vitamin C. help with that\nWell vitamin C is needed to keep the inside of the blood vessels\nStrong when and if you look at it most of the problems people are having collapsed arteries strokes ... in their body yeah vitamin C. makes what's called college in tissue in the body\nWithout it you don't make this repair tissue so you get this deterioration occurring when you don't have enough okay so it's very very important for cardiovascular health\nNow when you take your super see twenty two ... is it something you can feel working I mean what ... what kind of do\nOh yeah you feel a work in the first sign of health is more energy and you start
