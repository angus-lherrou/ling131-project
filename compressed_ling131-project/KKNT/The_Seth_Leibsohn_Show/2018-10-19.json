on my knees and I'm a strong Catholic many many rosaries that Hillary Clinton whatnot when [laughter] that we're in no way\nThat we needed a liar and our White House a terrible you know the thing that she does everything that's going on in the\nSmaller investigation but absolutely be pushed under Iraq you know I Am thrilled Donald Trump that the president and I'll tell you another either pleased with North Korea I have three children that are in their young they're twenty that live in Chicago and about a year ago every morning I woke up at three in the morning I\nGot my computer as the U.S\nCan journalists going in a rocket towards our country um I literally\nThis was not in consequential I remember they were actually testing they were doing fire drills or bombing drills with

I'm fifty five and I was thinking about what the hell was Obama than\nIf Obama got that he would have gotten um you know the Nobel Peace prize instead he got it or not really he got it for nothing but if he had done that it might have been justified\nAnd exactly so I tell you what Trump is like I I think of them as a cowboy I feel really excited we bought a man a real man and the White House leader

there were\nThere was a thing a while ago Laura\n... many years ago when you know the sophisticated some political analysis we're talking about what it is um women voters want in a you know it's always I I I don't like the way we dive divide people up that way you know it should be what two Americans one picture to America and that's what we are all at the end of the day but their profession\nIs to you know divide slice breaking and a breakdown in ... and approaching\nThe lemon unfortunately are really put it against one another\nAnd they are but you know I I've I've long are viewed um this as a more than anything else I just think\nAnd it's been my experience that more women think the way you do then not which is to say it's about really national security safety in the country confidence safety and national security that that is the universal appeal and you know you said you know [laughter]\nI I Know that there's um a media interest and I know that there's a left wing um power interested in raising\nYou know Specter's having to do with roe v Wade all the time but at the end of the day that's you know that is a minority of a minority among minority that actually has ever even gonna veiled themselves of that it needs to be\nAnd I just think national security is such national security is such the bigger issue\nUh-huh that anyway tell me if I'm all wet but that's my thought\nNo I ... and I'm In Arizona and I want to see this wall built and I am I'm all for immigration legal way\nI look at the poor people in this country I mean ... where is our

what they what they save for retirement right now they are they're very conservative than there are very or read [noise]\nAnd I'm very you read and I am one of the car you know that [laughter] [laughter] you're just pass a concert there for thirty one and I am so concerned that if the Democrats win this election\nI really believe that's going to be the last election that the white now that the Democrat\nI'm Sorry let me rephrase that I think that rap order and\nThe ... we are in our last opportunity I think we're going to lose um our nation for several years and and boating guy here come to the Democrats if we look at this particular election\nYeah I I yeah I mean we are told every election that you know it's a make or break election that the stakes could never be higher but it's all true every election it's just true or every election because the fires are higher every election I have never\nAn extreme like what's going on in our world today never all bad so you know the sort of just craziness absolutely it is a mob mentality a minute and that's what they're trying to do it better for their actions\nWell I think what has happened Pam is ... you make an interesting observation you've never seen anything like it I don't think you I think I I my thesis as to what's changed and what's different is that you know there was always a left in America there was always a left wing in a in a left power base or protest movement in America [noise]\nThey just never had a full\nPolitical party that supported them and supported them so brave suddenly and so outwardly and so obviously and so dependent on them you know once upon a time you know in my you know in my in certainly in my lifetime and I I'm guessing and yours\nYou know the Democratic party didn't want much to do with that stuff they thought it would hurt them actually too cozy up too far to the left\nWell those those those days are over and and those restrictions\nAnd hesitancy are gone for two reasons one is saying [noise] recently depend on them or for you know to do the legwork and and the door to door work and get the media attention but also because they've moved in that direction the Democratic party has moved in that direction [noise]\nCriminals or by the late ... what what order\nA constitution first Trump\nBack okay I owe you sent primary okay I didn't know if there was a third thing in there okay and\nUm and I believe that what you watch the left do something and forgive by language or um money talks and be asked walk just like Clinton was involved where a Planned Parenthood and everything if you followed the lines of money you will find that true\nYeah for sure for sure [noise] um it's yes it's ... and and notice how hard they invaded while at the same time calling for campaign finance reform\nWhich would have the effect of restricting conservatives and Republicans but not unions and not newspapers and television networks you know\nA talk about uh uh the tribute

have a civil conversation about race relations [noise] now coach I Know you listen to the show I'm period in San Antonio appreciate the\nCoverage me tell you something you're not helping you're making things worse\nRemember the polar came out a few months ago that said that six out of ten Americans feel that race relations are getting worse in America [noise] but then most of them never discuss the issue with their friends or family and I think about that\nRace relations are getting worse people agree that they're getting worse but they don't discuss it with friends or family\nThat would be something on the part of people like papa visions of people are discussing because it's such a sensitive topic because America still feeding racism the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow ...\nLet me tell you why people don't talk about it first of all most people don't think they are racist they don't most people think they're fair most people think that there give people an even shot most people consider themselves to be Christians and the whole basis of Christianity is\nThe golden rule\nTreating people the way you want to be treated most people think they do that so they don't like the races number two if the great overseas right and I am that racism is not a major problem in America anymore\nDespite the fact that you feel things are getting worse doesn't mean if some major problem is it ruining your day is a stop and even going into a marketing ordering something if the person behind the counter happens to be a different race and yours of course not\nWe're getting along just fine

normally there are sports things on TV for some reason with local news\nAnd they were doing a story about how a bunch of ... every year uh for for several days or lend their services for free to poor people are and they interviewed some woman happened to be black holding her baby and she\nWas saying my baby needs braces my baby needs braces and some white guy said what about your baby 's husband what about your baby's father what about your husband what about your boyfriend where's he\nAnd then some guy a table to over said hey ... and the guy that argument you got his haters races eventually left because uh you started to escalate to the point where who knows what might have happened so here you have all white guys one white guy saying out loud hey\nWhere's your where's the baby where's the father of your baby how can we can help us what he said how come the father of your baby can't help you\nStories it perfectly legitimate question he's called racist by another white guy so the point is people don't talk once the upside I Want to say how I feel is going to be politically incorrect\nNext thing you know I'm a big or or um an Uncle Tom ideas aggressive racism is not a major problem in America and I'm Talking to somebody thinks it is what's the upside how am I going to prove it what what am I going to say\nThat's why so coach you're not helping anything and Matthew is Chris Matthews expose the game listen to this is\nFor white people because why people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're racist show of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way to get them off the hook\nNow Matthew is making two points although he doesn't realize that the first is\nMost people aren't racist sorry\n\nEspecially since most white people will vote for somebody if they think they're racist if necessary for us to characterize it person had racist the brand Reagan his races to brand George W Bush's races to brand Donald Trump is races because most white people will vote for him to get it and he's races therefore we're going to characterize it raises\nThat's the one he's just exposing it\nMost white people coach are not racist car your friends races are you a racist or your friend friends racist\nKnock it off\nNineteen Ninety seven time CNN poll poll black teenagers and why teenagers have talked about this before both were asked\nDo you think racism as a major problem in America more white steam started wasn't black teens\nBut then they asked this do you think racism is a big problem a major problem or a big problem a I'm a ... minor problem or no problem in your own daily lives\nEighty nine percent of the black teens that racism was a miner or no problem in my daily life\nBlow up knock it off you're going to do three things get to the middle class coach you know this finish high school don't have a kid before you're twenty skipped married before yeah that kid you will not be poor regarding this business about introducing racism and and structural racism and and uh uh what's the word institutional structure Roland\nA systemic racism yeah how about the police coach tell these young black men comply you won't die\nVirtually all of these high profile cases would not have taken place had the individual flash suspect simply complied\nAnd his record his rule even if the officer gives you an illegal order you must comply unless we order company with force so you're not helping any anybody coach and the big problem and coach isn't your leak\nLook in the mirror for every player that does not have a kid outside of wedlock there's a player with to\nDo something about that that is the number one probably in the black community number one problem in the country forty percent of kids in this country are born outside of wedlock that is a massive problem Seventy three percent of black kids coach outside of wedlock that's the problem\nNot racism knock it off\nWe're gonna be talking with Dr ... just a second one of the things we're to talk about you is the abduction and apparently the murder of this Washington Post reporter here's what Jake Tapper set about it\nThis afternoon the president is denying he's giving cover in any way to the Saudis and the thing he simply wants to find out what happens but that's about a topic the president was willing to get he has had\nAnd I'm not so long ago most Democrats sort of not an agreement that today is hate speech and he lost his job but tonight the losses are gaining marks outlets joins us now\nWhat they saw for coming on the show um it did I miss state that I mean can you have to leave her job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party ...\nSome of those wars on Facebook and again also a military that\nI stand for the flag I knew lived across loses his job\nWhile I was the executive director of the county party um and yes basically that's exactly what happened because of that post which reminds me it was over a year ago that rose to that uh I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused on the Democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time know a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago\nIt wouldn't have been weird from the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and Neal before the costs ... what is it Ben five\nMember this was a the party DNC that do the inclusion of God in their platform number that\nYears ago a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive ... executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if your former coworker said two years since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is it as a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from any of them\nThat's a shocking what does this say to you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats in the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however was insensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive um that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up to the flag is considered racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward\nThat's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWell um I like to continue to bring this to light and continue to voice concern for this very issue um and then in the short term um ironically my son is going in the air force and sixty days I'm going to spend some time with him and and the man I Will continue to fight this cause as long as I can and continue to clear my name\n[noise] God Bless and let let me just say again I'm not in support of the Democratic party but I Hope you stay in that party 'cause I think it needs to

on the two two and the right lane had heavy traffic all the way that Eliot\nI should probably send that to Corey so she can do what I mean a traffic report but that's great thank you David I very very much appreciate that it's a great to get info from a\nFrom a what does um\nWhat is going on on the ground there are a truly wish I could be there it's going to be a great event the idea that a march ... and a Donald and Doug Doug do see are going to be there I think the law is what you're seeing in the polls visa v the Senate race particularly\nBut also these of the the popularity of Donald Trump my sense is he's much more popular than the polls are showing my sense is that these campaigns where they do see whether ... whether any of the others who will be there [noise] um who are running for reelection um or election\nUh my sense is what they know hum and what their internal show a would not have them there if Trump were not popular and of course he is what has he not as president made better by his um by his work as president\nHas not improved I'm\nOne of the um one of the things that I think is going on in the Democratic party in Arizona is some buyers' remorse I think that's particularly evident with the way you've seen them move money from one campaign to another moving money away from the\nDavid Garcia campaign for governor for example he has turned out to be just a\nTerrible candidate and a terrible debater his campaign put out an email yesterday it's an incredible email um\nIt's um I'll read I'll read some of the first of all it's subject is and this is from info at David ... is the subject line is heartbreaking loss\nNo I think they may want to save that for November seventh but who who puts out a subject line in the last weeks of a campaign heartbreaking loss it starts with Trump is coming to Arizona tomorrow just came out last night we\nHave no money to keep our ads on TV no money is in all caps so we are begging you to donate right away exclamation point exclamation point um that's that's that's really a heck of an admission we have no money to keep our ads on TV\nWell why would you give to a campaign that's run out of money two weeks before what is it to almost two weeks three weeks before the election\nSays to the person is was sent to we need to wire the TV station to keep our progressive TV and Internet ads flooding the airwaves so that's part of the problem running as a progressive and Arizona\nThese TV ads help us combat Republican onslaught and right now we have an opportunity to triple every dollar you make to keep our ads on the air so\nMatching request I I just think that this is I'm On a mile in la we would call this an admission against interest I think it's an incredibly incredibly stupid political um political effort\nSubject line heartbreaking loss and putting all caps we have no money to keep our ads on TV that's that's your Garcia campaign for yes\nOr they're done 'em and I think frankly that there's buyer's remorse in the party with some cinema I think I mean the stuff that keeps coming out that she is set in the past I think it's surprising even her [noise] and I think it's surprising even her because I don't think\nWhat she said in the past that she ever thought was that controversial which I think shows you the left wing\nTilt or not tilt consumption of her of her head um God

Israel curse in front of it has always been on the wrong side of the Islamic threat to our US Senator from Arizona to defend our nation and our way of life not undermined\nYeah for yeah I think we probably have to say that don't really play ... or I can say just to tell me what to say what I was like they are ...\nPerfect um thanks yeah Anthony I'm ... I Hope you know\nI'm the party is looking at some of these great people we have in Arizona and nurturing them to run for office you know someone like Judy would be a great candidate I think for political I I think he could win anything he ran for boy he'd be great [noise] um and maybe even the governors\nAre thinking about him because the governor what will have an probably have another appointment to make\n'em to the seat that um was held by John McCain because you may recall he filled the Jon Kyl\nA great but Kyle pretty much said he's only going to take that seat through the rest of the year and not the rest of the term so that means when do see is reelected um you know he'll have another appointment to make in a January\nMaybe someone like chess or would be good for that\nBy the way as I understand Arizona law in the off off off off off off chance\nThat somehow David Garcia were to win and he won't but just theoretically\nAs I understand Arizona law the appointment to that seat still has to be a Republican the law requires that ... ah the the appointment from the governor is a person who is of party he or she who left\nOr died um in office he left office prematurely [noise] now that\nThere's some comfort but it should be also cold comfort because if you're a democratic governor and you know you have to appoint a Republican boy [laughter] I think a few of us could think of a few Republicans we wouldn't want holding that seat um you could pick a\nWell Republican who's lousy let's just put it that way [noise] um now this is kind of from the hilarity

the Taliban a mix Sally does a very nice job in that it's a it's about a five minute clip and it was I think yes it was definitely post debate so it was just a couple of days ago after the debate earlier in the week and\nSally makes her point about how offensive it was to her you know she who fought the Taliban 'em and cinema goes into this long\nDetailed account of how the last thing on her mind would ever be to criticize the troops after all two of her brothers\nWere in the military one I think she said is still is I gotta tell ya I mean I I I Believe are on that but I just don't believe are about ... about what she says uh with regard to her from her her political um perspective her ideology I don't believe her at all she defended\nShe defended her comment in the Arizona Republic editorial meeting she said it was just kind of a a passing statement to refocus the conversation\nAnd it was a if you look at the rest of the comments that was about my opposition\nTo are going to war in Afghanistan which still I Believe I'm\nWas I had some merit now I got to tell you a Bob uh there weren't that many people in two thousand three who were protesting going to war against the Taliban um I think we all would have arguments with how\nWe continued that war and some of the after effects but she's still defending her opposition to going in and the first place that we now have her answer she still thinks that was a that was a bad campaign to go in and bomb the Taliban and two thousand three\nI got to tell you I mean I I think it's I I really think\nIt's it's beyond the pale I mean this is right out of the Michael Moore I'm far left protest movement that frankly I didn't even know had ten people and it turns out to have a lot more than ten people and she might be the next US Senator ...\n... what do you think about that a a Arizona Republican holdouts has her a fire against\nIt [noise] so yeah I saw that and then the guy who put it out which I think was data

don't think so [noise] um [noise] I don't know how she possibly could be with all this stuff coming out I think they're under polling Sally I really do [noise] um [noise] but um I Can't\nI don't have
