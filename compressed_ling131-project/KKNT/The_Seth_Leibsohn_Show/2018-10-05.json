demanded um\nWas wanting was wanting for a lot of reasons um okay let's quota Democrat let's go to a Democrat on what the sets the investigation yielded here's Alan Dershowitz\nDelighted to welcome back her good friend and juicy McCarthy she is a senior fellow at the national review Institute contributing editor\nTo National Review had a great piece earlier in the week I'm about uh the ... it well it was titled the Democrats complaints about the FBI investigation or absurd things have moved so fast that it seems like every argument the Democrats throw up\nAnd throw at us um get notified by the next day's news cycle but nonetheless there are some durable share Andy McCarthy welcome back to the airwaves to Phoenix\nThat's great to be with you thank you sir and thanks for spending part of your friday night with us or by the way is speaking of news did you have a chance to uh watch Susan Cole or here Susan Collins a speech today on the Senate floor\nI did hear a great deal of it yeah I I\nPlayed the last part of it in Toto for the audience I I thought it was absolutely fantastic I didn't know she was going to go that route I didn't know she had it in her\nUh but I thought it was the common sense wisdom that so many of us have been so frustrated at most people not understanding from what you heard what was your sense of it\nIs pretty much like yours and stuff that you know in terms of not thinking she ... capable of it um or that she edited or I guess the only way to put it\nUm if I had no she edited or I wouldn't have been concerned about are off with a couple of weeks um but I think that one should get shot at and to do the right thing\nUm she made as good a case for doing the right thing as could be done I mean there are elements of her uh\nHer martial any of the evidence that I don't agree with but I think\nShe gave a um [noise] you know my my interpretation of a [noise] I don't think it's a part of any logic or just\nYou know there are parts of the story that don't make sense to me and I don't have any hesitation saying that I'm thinking about it for turkey or some bomb I think she took the high road\nAnd basically said you know look giving her or getting credit um and you know for her sincerity here's where our ears why I Can't all subscribe to endorse for all\nOf you and he took it as something that's been proved you know uh that's about the mood I would've gone but it's probably a little more logs butter\nMaybe maybe so yeah maybe so I was I was surprised at some of the things she said including the her story Dr forwards doesn't meet the test of more likely than not I guess what you and I once would've called preponderance of evidence but whatever you want to play right [laughter] I I was surprised Susan Collins want that for a A R\nI'd been surprised by a lot of things [laughter] who would've thought it would have said well then let the stars of this past two weeks would be Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham\nYeah it it's true but you know I must say and I I spent some time talking with a ... which Lowery and I I guess I could hide there's like rich Lowry and I have a podcast that we do know on a on National Review once a week\nAnd we got a chance to to find the stuff and forth about what we sold most peculiar\nI must say I'm I'm Still struck by the fact that the um\nIt would seem to me if you're in a trial to be the most critical fact issue that had to be resolved by the jury everybody has basically just started that we're just going to move past it not in ... which is bad it it it seems to me that unless you indulge a great deal of psychobabble someone here is not telling the truth\nI agree with um I agree with you know\nAnd and we we basically decided to to indulge some you know psychological\nAll rise with that allows us to not deal with you know you miss Dr Ford\nUm something terrible happened to her but she just can't remember who did it ... and with Kavanaugh um you know he drank so much to go to the body might have been in it with his mind was and I you know I Can't wrap my brain around the focus you know in a normal trial\nYou would you would marshal the evidence and and you know somebody's not telling the truth\nHere well speaking of not telling the truth here\nOr do you think there's any chance to questions really do think there's a do think there's any chance read do you think it would be wise or for someone at the Senate Judiciary committee or and legal counsel's office to ... investigate or whether she may have committed perjury\nI think chefs are experience with that my my main concern at the moment\nIs that while I appreciate all the analyses are there going on in the end of the um [noise]\nIt's almost like a post mortem or did you read the political analysis and watch some of the shows uh I'm from the it ain't over until it's over school so I can see that there's a lot of hours between now and ...\nAbout five o'clock eastern tomorrow home my gosh okay money I mean is this somebody choice insurance\nWhich is I'm On I'm Glad everybody thinks they know how it's going to come out I don't I don't have that same God for that but I also think that our experience with this sort of stuff where there was just kind of a controversy or say you know I'm\nIn a political campaign where each side accusing the other of some kind of long going we tend to get you know we we tend to have the big moment of of catharsis\nIn uh in resolving yet and then what I I think our usual reaction is All right so let's now move on to a new thing that you know but he wants to go back and and um and when the counting you know and I imagine that'll happen here too\nYeah [noise] uh I I I I'm hoping and yeah you're reminding me of an old line I think it goes to Confucius or someone like that when you're jumping for joy and make sure no one's removing the ground from beneath her feet\nYou're right there's a lot of time between now and let me do ask\nYou though about um the charges that the Democrats have been throwing around for the last Seventy two or so hours entirely I thought predictable nonetheless or in front\nOf a U.S hopefully behind us but perhaps are still in front of us which was the FBI investigation um or the or the lack of a comprehensive a comprehensive analysis of it may be your larger point the unnecessary in us but if you would say a few words on so\nSure I I think as far as the um to to deal with the unnecessary and that's the first I think that we you know I was making a I'm\nA forward going argument when I knew that but I think now that the evidence is in\nIt kinda proves the point that you know ... when the FBI report finally came in we didn't really we weren't in any different position than we had been there and when it was the water right in the first place right near a week later down the road\nUm and my attitude was\nThat it wasn't going to change\nThe whole point of this this is not a criminal investigation about a counterintelligence investigation\nIt's not really an FBI principle mhm Rudy ... this is a Senate constitutional responsibility that for the past several decades or the FBI lend some investigative resources to ... but the FBI does decide\nIt it doesn't um but it does it take it over like it does a criminal investigation mhm it does it right and there were a decision about whether the candidate and the nominee is qualified or not and they just given the Senate what information and how much data bases\nAnd interviews a few people flags some insurance for the Senate ultimately this is a Senate constitutional responsibility and I frankly could not understand it just seems to be to be constitutionally\nOr whatever it just to jazz that until the FBI speaks we can't do anything because we didn't have an FBI in this country\nUntil Nineteen away mhm and we confirmed an awful lot of Supreme Court justices between Seventy eighty nine and I you know way\nYeah no I mean there there is an Iranian or the absurdity for Democrats to be saying that uh you know the advice and consent power of of the Senate should be farmed out to a basically the um parts of the administration of the executive\nYeah and and the other thing frankly about the politicization of this I'm I'm old enough to know\nOr to remember which means that must be about five minutes all mhm I'm attacking the FBI meant\nThat you were a attacking the great institutions of our country but the rule of law lives in some falls on I mean it just seems like five minutes ago or the Democrats were telling us how dare you suggest that you know going to the ... of course wants to proceed evidence or\nSomething that we can get Scott's because to to criticize the FBI was could be an opponent of the rule of law itself and now I'm I'm ... I feel like I'm back at the Justice Department I'm Glad to see the attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI are back in dog it makes me feel younger\n[laughter] Andy you've been generous with your time on a friday night you have time for one more segment or do you got to run I sure do wonderful happy to do oh wonderful thank you so much we'll be right back with more from Andrew seat McCarthy I'm set leave so we'll be right now ah\nConservative says have had such a hard time on social media is so much easier it is now with Facebook and Twitter banning conservatives well who's doing that banning who thinks it's okay to just so quickly remove\nThe rights of free speech and normative normative assumptions well the twenty and thirty ... somethings who run these organizations where did they learn it of course they're just taking what they got the universities and bringing it now\nTo the real world these are the places after all where conservatives have to have bodyguards if they are allowed on universities at all I mean this has now come to the fore\nYeah I think that's exactly right I think you're you have a situation where it used to be you know when we were coming of age\nThe the dominant idea and America was that we needed rides and the bill of rights particularly for his age to protect ourselves from a overbearing government and now flash forward all these years\nUm what were the people coming of age today think to believe is that government and the tool that allows you to inhibit\nThe things that you don't want to hear under the rubric of whether it's hate speech or or what have you but government is now the instrument that that denies\nThe liberties of people but you just decided are bad and evil and you don't want to hear from you know it's a very different way of looking at the world\nYeah absolutely right um one one last thing I'm\nAndy you're you're you're as ... as your greatly subtle and and and um impressive legal mind I've I've learned so much from you [noise] uh and and no less in politics um I actually have been thinking\nA contrary to many that this Kavanaugh um situation if ultimately he is confirmed tomorrow\nBoats poorly for the Democrats in November I think they were banking that it would be a good rallying cry I think it's backfired on them your sense\nIt's been a rallying cry but not the one they want to yeah it's a you know I got that sense it today cleaning NATO or had something interesting to say about this that would that rushed up but that's a very basically that you know everybody kind of rally around Trump because he was like\nThe um [noise] um he was the vehicle warts and all the ticket for the Washington establishment which is what people were really upset about ... and he won and what happens is is kind of lagging of enthusiasm narrowly is among the people who are the story of\nCourse the people who can't stand Trump or energize ... and if you were ever\nGoing to rally the Trump or if you needed that one single kind of thing I think it could have been we talked about these beliefs being well nearly killed it could have been that if it happens you know at a different time of year that I think this may be that the kind of simple rallying then\nPeople can wrap their brains around and and it's been in and drive from from the white lie to them or I agree\n[noise] pointing out this is what the left does Andy McCarthy you're the best and you're also dear friend thank you for spending some of your friday evening with us\nBank so great to talk to you God Bless you [laughter] I'm
