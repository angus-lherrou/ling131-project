teary eyed actually John you you really mean it was very sweet what you said it so I Know I'll just say thank you [laughter]\nBut I Want to make a point which is I always say on this show that the most important voices yours the listeners the callers and I mean and I love it when we talk to each other I Love\nDoing what I've always wanted to do in academia wouldn't let me do it which is just have a daily seminar on the most important things in our lives and I think of a seminars\nYou know students talking with each other all learning together and I just love it when we do that and the fact that you're telling me that you um [noise]\nYou have people that come up to you and reach out to you and say they they heard you make a point you know nothing nothing makes my heart happier than hearing that John nothing makes my heart happier because we're all in this together we're all in the wilderness\nAnd I'm not planning the lights on me I'm pointing it on you and your show is weighing wedding I'm\nPointing it only always did you ever drink a beer I don't know if you're a teacher or not but did you ever see a beer called Olympia it's made in Washington the state of Washington I remember I remember it well for two reasons it was my dad's ... for it and I remember on Sunday afternoons he would always open a can with lunch\nAnd then I saw it again on one of my favorite movies or the graduate um I think that's what he was Dustin Hoffman was drinking and the graduate but they had a they had a motto tomato on the town and the motto was it's the water\nAnd you know if I could have a model for the show it's the caller I you know I just you guys are great you guys and gals are fantastic you are what make this thing I'm just a dial tone I'm just a dial tone but John ...\n\nSignificance in self deprecating army I eat every once in a leader and you smell like it is and you make\nYou make that available give and take it they will say you know you are these are you a shining light\nYou know we are now entering realm of mutual corruption I'm just going to say thank you John John thank you both on the bottom of my heart really\nCall me again today\n[laughter] that's funny where we were just could start group ... uh what's it called a cold [laughter] plus Randy's in Glendale Hi Randy\nHi Shannon how are you a good first time caller I enjoy your show appreciate your ah your perspective on a lot of different things are a lot of great people on on nine sixty the patriots and I are\nThe best calls he I've ever been privileged to be a part of I'll tell ya and wouldn't that be a heck of a college faculty if you could have professors like he wouldn't Prager and the rest I mean my gosh just think about\nThe fact that these guys can't really get hired and major universities what a shame and ... and and sham for the university's what a deficit for the students it's a great faculty though it is a great faculty\nIt certainly is and and uh you know there's it's it's kinda\nIt's kinda frightening 'cause it's pretty much a localized or when you talk to people who don't listen to some of the radio stations here that are in town that have a different perspective on things and\nWhen you start to question people they start to get kinda they just get angry with years we're really though the main response because once you bring up a few points about what they don't know they know they don't know so then they get angry and start to cover it up so it\nIt's a you know it's a shame that this country is a is not really observant on all the things that are going on around it\nYeah I Know it's true enough it's very hard to have\nPolitical discussions now isn't it because and emotion seems to be more important\nUh and compassion seems to be more important than comprehension it's um it's really unfortunate because it's I like to say Randy what we're talking about they really are the most important things in the world they really are the most important things we can do I know people it's fashionable [noise]\nMaybe you'll disagree but I I I Know it's fashionable for a lot of people to cry for example to denounce the criticized the money that's spent in politics I don't I don't when you look at things we as a country spend money on\nIt pales in comparison to the things like sports or movies or entertainment or\nAny other kind of amusement that this country takes seriously and that we spend every two years for two months to a lot of money on politics\nIt doesn't pick my pocket or break my leg of Thomas Jefferson said I ... I I think we need more of it because when you try and have a political discussion with someone who disagrees with you it's just awfully hard and it shouldn't be this hard it really shouldn't\nThat's correct and and the other problem that that you're having is is is this country I'm I'm a Seventy one years old so I've been around for a few years and a\n... I've seen this country change in how it's developed and I think are Democrats and Republicans back in the sixties or or I should say maybe the fifties go back a little further it was pretty much are they disagreed and you know they were kind of passionate about it but there was not this\nAlmost hatred against the other\nPerson you know what it was still Randy you know what's interesting I think I think you're right I think there was less hatred in less vitriol I'm\nA ... mostly in one direction mostly from left to right uh that's what I think I've noticed changed so much no one was making comparisons to Hitler in the fifties and sixties no one would do that but but one one thing one thing that I think um it was also different\nUh there used to be kind of a rule an unspoken rule of things you don't talk about in\nPublic you know politics religion um women maybe if you're a guy guys if your women but I'm\nThe larger points Dennis was talking about this a couple of weeks ago and I I tried to do something on it too there used to be safe spaces from politics not safe spaces in the sense of you can't hear a conservative message which is absurd but just places were not everything has to be political all the time\nAll the time everything has to be political and I think that's unfortunate um because it's\nNot possible it's it's there's there's there should be room for those are the things I mentioned there should be room to have\nHad no place in the United states of America he went on to talk about the um [noise] federal organizations involved in investigating\nHe retweeted Mike Pence's tweet a with the statement I agree wholeheartedly denouncing any kind of these um attacks um and so\nChuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi put out a statement saying his words ring hollow I'm so much for unity so much for unity I'm so much for [noise]\nYou know never taking [noise] yes for an answer a Bill Kristol has said this morning that Donald Trump should cancel all political events and spend ten minutes talking about this well he and his wife both spent more than ten minutes talking about it\nBut um I Would like it a Bill Kristol would spend a few minutes or condemning what Hillary Clinton said today can you play it again though I don't think we've done it this hour I think it's something we should all have in our memories and we'll\n\nNever more than today [noise] but it is a troubling time isn't it [noise]\nThe time of\nDivision [noise]\nAnd we have to do everything we can to bring our country together [noise] we\nAlso have to\nElect candidates will\nSo this is at a political rally for Donna Shalala down in Florida\nAnd I just can't repeat this enough I just can't break this statement up enough she says it's a troubling time isn't it why why is it a troubling time who was troubled\nUm a lot of us were actually\nPretty happy with the conditions of our country it's troubling to her because she's not president it's troubling to the room she was in because she didn't win the presidency and they don't have the house or Senate literally\nThat can be the only definition of why it is troubling because\nSince when I have the facts on the ground of what's going on in America being better\nThen she goes on to say it's a time of deep division why a lot of us did not go around marching and shouting not my president who's been divisive here a lot of us voted for the president and we're very much looking forward\nTo a fairly or you know just a plain old peaceful transition of power sometimes they get\nTo govern sometimes we get to govern [noise] but they were the ones that started the not my president movement and also by definition it can't be the party in power that's creating the division\nIt's from those who lost power and didn't get the power they hoped for for self entitled to it is she Hillary who a week ago said you cannot be civil to those who oppose you politically until they get back to empower\nPeople she was a week ago she called for fun civil disobedience uncivil\nNot civil ... [noise]\nI Know it may not be bombs [noise] so what does someone mean telling people that [noise] and then today talking in the passive voice about how we live in a time of the division yeah we do she created it [noise]\n\nNinety sixty new matter Oreo con calling for unity actors especially if I bought several prominent Democrats including former President Obama and Hillary Clinton\nWe will spare no resources are expansionist effort and I just wanted to use that in these times we have to unify\nAt a White House event in a town called it despicable and said whoever is responsible will be brought to justice he added there's no place for any kind of political violence in the U.S suspected explosive devices were also male to CNN\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder Florida democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and California Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters a similar device let's found Monday at the home of billionaire left wing activist George Soros\nThe on\nAnd given an Oreo candidate Andrew Gillum Lewis running in Florida is under fire for appearing to have lied about getting show ticket in exchange for political favors National Review reports newly released records show Gillum accepted tickets for the Broadway show Hamilton now were purchased by an undercover FBI agent\nHe thought was a land developer\nThe documents show Gillum apparently den lied on numerous occasions and claiming he was unaware who purchased the tickets when he attended the play an ethics commission is also looking into trips Gillum to New York in Costa Rica current polls put give them a heads\nUp Republican Rhonda than just by nearly five points in the governor's race [noise] I'm\nHe's going to find some heavy traffic and you're heading north town on the one on one of three like apple accidents to watch farmland is going to be more than asking them voted off to the right and another officer them I just after ... boulevard over in the valley you found I can just after a while for the past boulevard in Chandler crashed there off right\nAround the like your market ...

serious wounds that were suffered by a Representative Steve skull lease a Nancy Pelosi was asked about the correlation\nBetween speech and violent action and does it go to audio I haven't I haven't heard it myself someone just sent it to me but let's let's hear it I'd like to have this discussion\n[noise] well I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by maverick how the ... are\nOutrageous that needs to be taking any of the job that they hold any the dignity and respect that would like Congress to command\nHow dare they say such a thing how dare day so this sick individual that's something despicable and it was horrible what he did hateful\nWell said then all of a sudden these sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before Ryan I don't even want to go into effect you know the United states but in terms of some of their language and that he has used it again I I like to go there and the other day right since you are willing\nTo dismiss the notion that political speech responsible political speech can be held liable for violence\nToday she's singing a different tune I Am um [noise] what's her original position\nYou know it's an it's it's it's a very dangerous thing in a in in a representative democracy and a republic in any kind of society that respects normative absolutes such as a political speech rights of assembly free speech free press\nAs um as I say usually on a show whenever there's an incident like this terrorism that's what this is or at least attempt to terrorism\n[noise] um\nLet's not any of us rushed to be the first to be wrong let's not rush to be the first to be wrong I think there is\nA general rule we can rely on the general rule will be if it is\nDone from someone who is posted something\nConservative or Republican oriented on their social media or has been an activist and the conservative moment of the Republican Party um we will no sooner than if they have something on their social media or have been active\nIn um leftist uh operations or the Democratic party or that as a general rule I think we can rely on\nAnd get as a general rule that if it has any connection whatsoever to radical Islam it will take longer to be reported um interesting speculation I saw on Twitter was for all the um [noise]\nAll the uh uh fears that the Democrats have stoked about Russian interference in um [noise] the half of the Republican Party and against the Democrats why has no one blamed Russians for doing this um\nBut you know you can play that game all day long the one thing that I own and it's the only thing I Know is that you cannot blame normal political speech the actions of the mentally unstable or there will no longer be any political speech\nWe have problems in this society with those who need help we have problems with those who need you know mental help\nI'm all for addressing that has its own issue in the schools in society goodness gracious knows I have spent probably more time than any other radio host maybe in the country on changing involuntary commitment rules Mona churning I Do it a fair amount I Would like\nTo have those discussions but to blame the precedent for this no I'm Sorry that's irresponsible and as\nFar as whether it was coordinate coordinated by one part of sooner another or any kind of what's the phrase of our\nPeople use false flag operations\nI'm not willing to and I don't think any of us should go they're\nNot yeah we'll get the answer soon enough and we will get the answer I Am convince these people are always found um so you know treat them like we would want any other major action to be treated or for that matter minor action\nAnd wait for the facts to come in but you know that message today needs to\nBe heard and absorbed by the New York times and Jeff Zucker and Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer given what they said more than anyone else more than anyone else Larry is in Phoenix Hi Larry\nHey good afternoon good afternoon good afternoon they quickly only because it's not that I don't take this seriously because it's very serious because who knows what it could have been or what it is yeah\nThat's a nice state it who knows what it could have been that's a that's a good way to put it\nBut what I'm looking at and I believe that you know my first question is who started the October surprise way back when okay yeah number two I think that the electorate a has become quite savvy in the past couple of maybe this past Fifteen Years\nEvery year old and he's smarter I think\nI'm looking at it that you know we actually look at this thing dissect it and go and and unfortunately think about speculation what is good to to profit by their you know all of the things that go around to it only because it happening now\nAnd because one side doesn't like things being called the mob so you think well we got to come up and make sure we're equal okay on both sides anyway that was just that it was just to throw it out\nThere sure but I really am curious about the October surprise sure started it and when you know one of those uh sure sure sure Larry and\nUm I'll have to thank you for the call all uh be willing to be corrected by any listeners on this and I'll go have to check my history books again on this the most famous one in recent memory I think unless someone wants to give me a better example was in the Nineteen Ninety two presidential election\nWhen a\nCaspar Weinberger who was Reagan's secretary of defense was indicted or for the Iran Contra affair right before the election I think that's\nThe most famous one in recent history but somewhere in memory I Want to say there might have been something in the Seventy two election with a Nixon McGovern and I can't put my finger on it what I think we have\nAre a bunch of ... um Graf things onto news stories as deliberate\nOctober surprises people saying oh well there's your October surprise I a few people were doing it over the past ... of\n... a few days or so with regard to the um mobile mob traveling in Mexico [noise]\nI I don't know [laughter] we'll know will no sooner off on that too I Will say I don't think [noise] set the optics are visuals horror stories about that mobile mob are helpful [noise]\nTo uh the Democrats in any way shape or form I think if anything\nIt solidifies the viewpoint that we need a stronger and more secure border so if there was a deliberate attempt by the left I think a boomerang [noise] um [noise] but I'll stick by I think for now the most famous one being Bush Clinton in Caspar Weinberger in Iran Contra Lawrence Walsh was that the same well ... see the council at the time [noise]\nBut all er all research it and see if it goes back further we'll be right\nBack [noise]\nJohn don't rush to hear from Grand Canyon planning when it comes to talking about financial planning whether it's IRAs for one cage Roth IRAs and

regular schedule 'em up or trinity to speak\nWith him MSNBC liberal anchor slash host of other name is Stephanie rural you probably know about her you've probably heard clips played from her and over I got a chance to talk to her to say that it was\n... entertaining\nI think was an understatement enough so that I feel like replaying it for you it's only about five minutes long that so much time in the morning drop clock but I Want you to hear from stepping in rural just to get a feel for what the liberal point of view is as it pertains to President Trump and his supporters headed into these midterm elections\nBecause the president can't say anything without the liberals adding words to his statements in order to make them sound offensive\nAnd you know exactly what I'm Talking about the left going crazy about the president too large to do speaking in Houston, Texas on behalf\nOf Senator Ted Cruz at a sold out Toyota sold out packed jam packed Toyotas center with thousands of more people outside\nThe president declared he's a nationalist that is a dog whistle we're told that is an absolute statement us a call it's code coded language to the base saying I'm with few white supremacist wow and what\nYeah I'm going to talk about that and we're going to I'm going to play back for you\nThe conversation that I had was suddenly rule closer to talk about what nationalism really means with where he has some ah who is a very impressive person he was a a close senior advisor Marshall for Raasch when uh the Brexit was decided\nAh we're in England or in Europe rather when Great Britain decided to essentially remove itself from\nA view and you know what that is that as an actor of\nNationalism we're going to talk to ... uh and then also as it pertains to the ongoing an ever marching inexorably\nToward the southern border of the United states the northern border of Mexico that Central American caravan now believed to be some fourteen thousand strong [noise]\nAh what does it mean for the United states and what can we do to stop\nWhat I think most of us would agree is an invasion it is not a migration it is an invasion RJ home and is the director of governmental affairs for their the federation for American immigration reform still got back coming up next our show also a lot of really good people to talk to and including Kurt shorter ... reading his auto reply\nStuff in rural from a conversation but I've had with her earlier today\nBut the lead story of course we have to get into is who is sending explosive well potentially\nExplosive devices to prominent Democrats in New York and Washington DC the homes of George Soros the Clintons Brock Obama and others apparently have been targeted for these suspicious packages let's get a little trickier of the news on this from ...\nTo tally six packages were confirmed threats three in New York at the home of billionaire George Soros on Monday and today it's CNN and one addressed to the home of bill

for Larry here now in the in the later hours and I want to share one thing from them with you know\nI had a chance to talk with um Stephanie rule Stephanie and I'm a I'm a somebody see host an anchor and\nYeah you know I went there or you know I'm I'm very familiar you know Bernie Sanders the all obviously the or the headline act of uh of misinformation and uh you know almost everything he started with either a half truth or boy can lie\nAnd he was saying all this while he was literally criticizing President Trump for lying [laughter] and anyone on a whole tirade a you know for ten or twenty minutes about how you know all these Republicans and these\nConservatives are racist than homophobic and back from a genetic\nInsulting ever you know insulting insulting insulting and then the last line that I just thought what do you know\nA while so funny was um well we need to come to you know and the people you know [laughter] like\nThat's a pretty good imitation well that's the same talking point Hillary used yesterday blame the other side with any language do you want any weapon at your disposal any epithet you can think of and then say but elect us\nSo that we can put an end to that kind of language all of their lives just political appetite and it's terrible it's terrible politics\nAnd towards the end of him he was wrapping up so I uh had removed the as I was telling you to make America great ... ... and you know just as the closure you know or not you know I'm more of a President Trump than because of the way the media\nTreats and I get it that if they if they would treat him fair and they have plenty of stuff to treat unfair about [laughter] and\nI Can't tell you how many Republicans right after the inauguration saw the leftist I'm not my president movement in what they were saying and that rally saying okay now I'm for Trump you know we're a minded man why they won Republicans yeah I've seen a lot on our\nHim yeah I didn't vote for him in the primary but either way they just do unfairly treated him\nUm [noise] it just it's just disgusting really um but I remember my make America great had I play it on and I was I was probably within Fifteen or twenty feet of a Senator Sanders and I I turned around to take a selfie\nWith him in the background with my hat on and you should have seen these people's eyes a there was only about a thousand people in the heart to ask you I would've thought there would have been five\nI Would have to I went to a U.S yeah yeah\nBut there was barely a thousand people in the east people's eyes wire so wide and there are a couple of their job actually draw yeah they could not believe sell them on a different opinion would be there to listen to what the other side had to say\nAll empty you know a lot of courage and I'm Glad you did it and I'm Glad you could report on it\nBecause I have heard this again and again from Democrats they use the worst kind of empathetic a language they can against us and then tell us if we're back in power we will bring America together again while they're the ones making a device of I mean it is an awfully hard thing to do to divide America when you're the people in power\nAnd for them to blame Republicans for being divisive when they're the ones in power adjust well if it don't gelatin aspect you know\nYou know they're not really offering anything up a a you know the Republicans offered up hey we want tax reform you know we want to do this and that their poll platform as we're not those people those people are evil vote for us and they're not really offering up\nYou know and they're not bringing to the table they just talking about how awful everyone else is at the table\nI think the twenty twenty reelection campaign is going very well\nAnd that's what I couldn't be yeah [laughter] yeah thank you Lance I really appreciate it [laughter]\nPlease call again soon I like your style Kyle is in Phoenix Hi Kyle\nDoes I'm well how are you\nVery well thank you we are I called yesterday and talked about you know whether or not these parcels we're going through a courier service or a post office yeah\nUm I think I can kind of bridge that gap between the courier service to the post okay\nLot of places a lot of like big companies have something called color service it's like a box of cereal box cutter thing sure and they have a career that occur that goes with picks up the mail every day every morning and then brings a male to their mail room or their office or what not\nSo I think the courier service is probably the the collar service where career picked up their mail and chicken there that's where it was delivered by a career\nCould be a ... all of these could be an ... and by the way it's also entirely possible that each of these are several of these cases are different um in methods of delivery\nI'm One of the\nThings that I think it's been pointed out about the package that was addressed to I'm a former CIA director Brennan\nIs that it had stamps on it but no cancellation markings as if it actually hadn't gone through the mail like it might have been intended to go through the mail might have looked like it should have gone through the mail but it didn't\nJust because it didn't have any U.S Postal service stamping on it I'm right\nBut I you know that has happened before too because of the kind of package it is it's it's not\nIt's not you're not long ago about ... either way you're not wrong about that point I have received a mail that way you're right it did but Ninety five percent of the time it would be the other way but I more and more or maybe less but you're right it it can happen that way you're right you're right\nI I just wanted what am I thought about the courier service yeah\nNo I appreciate it but it doesn't lead you to think one way or another as far as you know who sent it I still can't wrap my head fully around that point\nIt stars who sent it I'm not going to make\nAny good yeah so yeah we get more information\nYeah that's where I Am able to get out and that's where I Am to ... I just yeah thank you I appreciate it uh let's see Brad is in Phoenix Hi Brad\nHey value and south I'm well how are you sir I'm find listeners the common yeah and I was listening to your exchange with for the prior caller who was kind of argue the case about the FBI yeah yeah yeah yeah [noise] what I heard\nYou say was she heard that the FBI and declare that the packages had gone through\nThe mail did say that yes\nNow if he said he heard it now if it's in fact true that the FBI did say that they did not go through the mail I think she was leading to the same conclusion I Do there is higher risk because there's there's there's hanky panky\nThe point is this let's let's let's let's put it as starkly as we can bread is just plainly as we can the point is if they didn't go through the mail and the FBI is saying they all went through the mail [noise] the point is the FBI is lying to us correct\nNow I just had to understand what the claims being made here is when thank you for that when you read the press release that the FBI has put out\nThe first sentences between October twenty second and twenty fourth two thousand Eighteen suspicious packages were received a multiple locations in the New York in Washington DC areas and Florida they say received they do go on several senses down to say the\nWere mailed in manila envelopes with bubble wrap into are they do use that word mailed [noise] I don't know if we can take from that that they mean all of them or [noise] yeah but it\nMay be er into yeah I could be I could be we'll be right back no\nQuestion you need omega threes\nBut which forum should you Jake\nFisher oil or drill oil scientists have debated this for years luckily there's a new solution to satisfy everyone keeps called Carrillo may go fifty plus it combines all troops your fish oil and joins soothing crew loyal to gather in just one tiny feel it's so powerful it can promote the health\nOf your heart and your arteries and if that wasn't enough it could also boost your joined comfort him ... days we're so sure cruel omega fifty plus all worked for you will even send you a free bottle to put to attach the debate is over it's nuts\nFish oil or krill oil it's most and now\nIt's free just pray for Ninety five or shipping and claim your free bottle call now one eight hundred six seven nine fifty seven forty five one eight hundred six seven nine fifty seven forty five that's one eight hundred six seven nine fifty seven forty five\n... hey I'm Down here it's just the way your basketball yes basketball the kids live near a long time ago\nAnd I miss the air and hearing those shouts enjoy getting a little layer of mind that gives them phonics it land okay great let's get down to\nMaybe matching parents can't get are encouraged me to how many lifestyle by\nCan't get him going to miss a flash in the country\nEspecially if you ask the a ha Indian\n[noise]\n\nWe'll come back to the leaves and show just listening to that most of the sanctions\nInterview I Can't help but comment on that on on something here there were a for effect that that there are four candidates for mayor most is is a running as a Republican or at least he's you know by by by his own statements typically not known as a partisan race but he is the only Republican in the race he was running\nA proudly has the Republican I have a proudly endorsed him and not because he's a Republican because I've known him for a long time I think he's a wonderful human being and we'll do a wonderful job\nUm that he's a Republican is no surprise to me\nI'm not my point of my point is the Arizona Republic has made an endorsement\nNational border patrol was robbed when doors for\nThan ... percent candidate for us and\n... percent of\n[noise]\nSome policy culture principles to follow the leaves and show will also\nThat was fine\nThursday October twenty shift to cells and an Eighteen so delight to bring back to the to um to the airwaves to Phoenix so my friend Brandon ... he's a contributing editor at American greatness\nFormer Republican congressional staffer and security expert national security expert he runs the white gr report Weicker the ... the white to report dot com website you wrote a really really good piece yesterday at American greatness the left used bomb scares excuse to ... the writer hit Brandon ... welcome back\nAre you doing and they said what are the kind words I I always go to a big boost whenever I talk to your work you will ... I Hope you\nKeep getting it 'cause I Want to keep talking to you always a right really well and ... and you say I'm more secure early or what I think so either all\nThat great editors to or a great group over that area or a or a group I ... I Know them very well\nThe point of the the large point that you wrote this yesterday and and things have developed a little bit since then although I don't know that any of us in the public the the the law enforcement agencies may be closer to knowing\nWho were who's sent these things are but we in the public I don't think are we do have more accusations though um the piling on of the accusations that um the rhetoric of the right or the rhetoric of conservatives were particularly the rhetoric of president Donald Trump\nIs what has inspired if not been a the direct cause of these things indeed there was a car on as you well know yesterday on CNN saying President Trump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for fighting serial\nBomber a personal responsibility as if he actually\nPut these things in the mail or sent them to a career I built the personal responses to Bill Clinton take personal or any responsibility for Oklahoma or Obama personal or any responsibility for Fort Hood my God right\nRight well remember former workplace violence we can't forget about that yes [laughter] um you're absolutely correct um you know it's funny because we're part of the article yesterday I was I was at home and so on I was I'm pretty sure MSNBC in the morning with a good job and make\nSomebody made one was one of those shows will do in the morning somebody made a comment um you know I\nRemember Alexandria shooting last year they showed it to\nRemember the Republicans war to jump on and say it's all the left to blame ya while at the same that that's going to be you know they did it the more to do with the same way yeah and it was a paraphrase but that's what this one guess will say that I really got me going it'll start seeing now is fundamentally different from what happened last year\nIn Alexandria and uh you\nKnow the good nature as I certainly article the nature of a shooting it usually is that the shooters killed on site and they can pretty quickly identify but what was interesting was how slow the mainstream media was it not only state he didn't go to the person the shooter in Alexandria wars\nBut also studying that yeah there was a politically charged motive and oh yeah it was politically charged from the left the white\nAnd you know so they were all slow to respond to that end to tell the truth on that but they weren't even waiting for facts to come out on his proposed bombing you know all these democratic notable\nOr to start blaming the right to start blaming Trump at the end of the day this is all about shutting down Donald Trump and his so called the political thing of course she\nYou know the the entire thing is but it's a battle of communication so Trump up and the narrative\nHe completely you know trash the original meeting this model it doesn't filter himself turns the mainstream media he goes around them goes above them goes through them\nUm and so he is a threat to them since the beginning and obviously his politics are a threat to the left overall and so they're trying to figure out how to stop me I mean it's not politically correct he won't be cowed boy that George W. Bush was he doesn't care and show the left has to figure out how to use these crises\nToo by the way now it appears that it's probably a manufactured crisis the bombs were never designed to go off is what I'm hearing from the police report and coming out at least some of these bombs the one that was sent to CNN the black powder and and the wires and whatnot will harmless\nNot that it's okay but you know I Am beginning to think maybe this was a you know maybe someone what George Soros stuffing though the packaging himself I'm kidding of course but we don't know and yet the left has been jumping down\nI tried to get us to shut up twelve days before this important mid term election\nRight there's a lot and what you said I Want to go through with you and uh I think you'll agree with me even on on something I Want to challenge you on a little bit if that's okay but first of all\nOn that Bernie Sanders supporter or a guy who said positive things are said he supported Bernie Sanders who was responsible for the shooting of Steve squeeze I I actually don't remember any conservatives are any Republicans demanding Bernie Sanders take responsibility for you know if\nYou remember Paul Ryan and everybody was coming out with that people are saying that this doesn't represent\nAnyone up here in Congress Republicans were very I think a judicious to fall right tired of value you know I I wrote an article I think you guys have when you were with Clinton thanked me unless we're discussing article which I Would say if I Lived a mile down the road and I go to the coffee\nShop there my kids went to school right across the street from there I have friends who live in a brownstone right across the street and solve the shooting happened and so I was like oh this is definitely one of the political I mean this was aware that this\nWill clear it was politically motivated no one was claiming that it was bragging terrorists who instigated it\nNo Republican elected or ... I don't I don't even think any conservatives on the outside really right when you are okay from you know aside\nFrom your um another thing I think you'll agree with me on um no we don't know who it is yet I Will find out um whenever we find out if it turns out to be someone who has said positive things about conservatives or the Republican Party will find out sooner\nRather than later you're someone who is some positive things in their social media accounts about Democrats or the left where it'll take a little longer\nDress up as if a ... a an act of violence takes place in this country or involves the death of any or injury of any Americans and its committed by a radical Islamists it takes a little longer and if it's not we get it a little sooner if this is just ride rule we have now come to live with\nNo doubt one thing I wanted a challenge you on just a little bit and you can correct me and I don't agree with me is I'm\nA CNN is talking about you you sort of use the phrase geology the package that was sent to CNN [noise] um yeah this I I I CNN is making a lot out of this and and maybe there's not a lot of\nImportant to the point I'm trying to make here but CNN has tried to inject themselves into this story in a way because they have been the ones from the get go who have been saying the claim fakes fake news is an institution to violence\nUm this was a mistake that it was sent to CNN [noise] it was not deliberately saying it was sent to former director Brennan who's the guy saw work than CNN [noise] it was a ... says if\nIt was sent to me with John Brennan ... with John Brennan's name on it and I write claiming it was sent to I was the target of the bomb I was not\nAnd I'm more than CNN was it was John Brennan and CNN has I think deliberately inflamed the situation as it being called\nKiller it's things like the ratings boost their ratings boost to pay me what I think it also helps them with their narrative but we'll\nGet some kind of instigation to violence\nAbsolutely but you know I'm of the mind I I actually don't think that this is going to have the impact I think it well\nI I really don't I I I really I think that I think that most Americans have made up their minds about how they're going to vote if they're going to vote at all and you're looking at the surge in absentee voting that's actually favoring Republicans it and it was not supposed to\nAnd so I think that um I think all of this is probably not\nI knock on wood in terms of the Republicans winning but but this is clearly whether you know whether the attacker to the potential bomber on the right whether he is on the left and doing this chin up ... to come out and vote and overwhelmed right who knows I mean this is the problem is what I think my article the fact is we don't have\nAny information and we're not going to get\nAnd that's and it's very dangerous and irresponsible for the media to be jumping up and down without having a sense of evidence of all it's\nA high and this and why they did it uh it's very irresponsible and it's dangerous and it just stokes the division and rancor and actually it does the Russians work for them it gets more Americans hate each other which is you know clearly what the Russians want supposedly\nWell I think that's right and I think up until yesterday didn't we all kind of trying to abide by a rule that we don't politicize as much as we can we don't politicize violent attacks and make them the fault of one party or the other and yet here we are\nHe talks a lot harder but his his policies are actually very modern as you say something that you would probably see out of Nelson Rockefeller back in the day\nYeah or ... years off yeah you know a very a Kennedy Republican and Reagan Democrats\nThe hard way to put a yeah Kennedy Republican in Oregon Democrat I think that's right at the point does a new one or two calls with the by the way you want to say if you will ... will do that in a moment I just have to get this off to clear my conscience because I just have to say this for three more days\nAnd it's what Hillary Clinton said yesterday she said it's a time of deep division and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together we also have to elect candidates will try to do the same\nTake that lessons away for a moment we'll come back to that all she's doing this politicizing this point but when she goes into passive voice it's a troubling time and it's a time of deep division who the hell made it so right now is not from the people in power who are dividing the country ever by definition\nRight oh right well I remember it was a month ago but she was saying wait we can't these civil wars with our opponents she was famous\nUntil we are back in power it's back and\nLook what you know and then you will get vaccine waters you look at Nancy Pelosi the rhetoric is dominated look at the protest shutting down you know conservative speakers on campus\nShabby I mean they see I live here I see it all the time I'm afraid to even like we have anyone say oh I recognize you because I I never know if like I'm going to get attacked\nOr spit on a you know ... we've got some people who are part of the truck coalition out here in our neighborhood and one of them got spit on the other day at the Safeway are\nWhy do people think pollsters were surprised by the election it was because people are afraid to say they were voting for Donald Trump the way I put on his name in the last left his that was invited to a college campus that needed security\nAh probably do war yeah maybe maybe more but that's because he was saying things were astounding not liberal yeah\nYou know I mean it's when you get off the reservation even if someone has delivered a ...\nPoint tips because he said conservative things that he needed already right\nRight right right and he showed up real quick yeah but you know\nNo it's a very good point it's a really good point a brand new ... and you want to stick around we'll take some girls great Sarah Anna's in Phoenix you're on with me and Brandon white cursor an\n... of course our biggest problem you're\nHearing about\nUm you know our our bombs that are from from from the media for\nGoing crazy I'm driving is seen\nUnderneath over cats that anyone can and I he probably twenty twenty five women for ... and I love it fires are hard and they're happy\nThat this many are slipping under the first one so laughing because a lot ... than the people\nThat they went so disrespectful ... someone off or just flying an American flag and sang plenty plenty\nTo sell the rent yeah no this was thank you for that they are and this is the point Brandon and I were just making you know um it's it's when you when when you can't win at the

American people you ramp up everything you start censoring you start throwing bricks Britain bats you start throwing water\nUm let me ask this question of you sir and and the rest of the audience
