Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with strong evidence close will their words of Native American ancestry daily beef also left wing publication you living as Warren fights Trump's Pocahontas talk with DNA tests proving Native American\nGroups ... really\nIs that when it proves one one thousand and twenty fourth that means the percentage of Native American ancestry in her is actually lower than the average in America\n\nShe claims you never got any sort of benefit by claiming to Native American kid with CBS is Massachusetts Senator Kennedy Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday sought to explain to controversial decision to west herself as a Native American and the directory of law professors\nNearly a decade before getting a job at Harvard and said she is absolutely qualify for her job in the

some sort of reparations for black people who have more white blood white ancestry in them that Elizabeth Warren has a Native American Cherokee and Delaware and her and therefore I'm old all of the lack of my having benefited from white privilege for all these years\nSince white people all benefit from white privilege so it seems to me the people that could have been designated as white who didn't do so given the standard is pretty low one one thousand\nIt seems to me I Know somebody over here and I'm thinking about Obama now he'd where it gets complicated that's what I'm saying we're we're we're we're altogether thinking history that collectively given them the new standards were learning from Elizabeth Warren who not once Donald Trump to pay up\nDonald Trump once said he'd give a

thanks for listening and we'll do our best not just entertaining but being substantive information to you so that it can help you with best outcomes and just if nothing else keep you informed there's so much happening across the board if you bought any political any news station\nLeft right middle line it is so overwhelming all the different moving parts as to what a lot of us do is we migrate to what we call the most important issues in our lives right maybe it's the economy maybe it's jobs maybe it's oil you heard a lot of stuff in discussions even earlier today\nWe were talking about oil but you see all these different things maybe at school choice who knows all this information is rolling around out there on the Web it's rolling around in our publications we subscribe to and we try to find a way to the best outcome and a lot of us what we'll do is we go to our special interest right\nMaybe you are an avid mountain biker maybe or our gym this maybe you've got kids programs scouting you name it\nPeople find a way to them uh jujitsu guy if I have free moments to watch videos I'm typically going on and looking at big guys\nAnd what they do to be the best if there had their practice or what they're what they're doing in their martial arts nonetheless the idea is to bring information that's real meaningful and legitimize is the process see when we look at this we just had a caller named Jennifer that called in and mentioned that she is filing a lawsuit against\nA now senator Katie Hobbs who is running for secretary of state here in Arizona against our Republican conservative candidates Steve Gainer now that the challenge is is that she went down and they took a picture of the governor somebody had no case time [noise]\nAnd um and as you can imagine there there are a lot of symbols in science that we do with their hands with the left or left rules\nHave found their way to basically calling everybody on this earth that doesn't agree with him of course\nA white supremacist a racist a big it a hater I mean this is just this is their their line I mean even David Garcia mentioned that the debate the other day\nWhen he went through the debate it was like the very end of the debate he finally said oh you keep mentioning people that were superintendent public instructions and you're only mentioned the names of those men that were Hispanic\nOr Latinos and so that is obvious you're going after my race and and I'm thinking to myself I think that Governor was actual revering these other leaders\nTo make a point that they are endorsing him not David Garcia but he spun it right the very end they just can't help themselves we've lost we're getting beat up\nOld might as well call guy racist because that's the way it goes so here Jennifer in friends getting smashed around on social media through the media and I'm kind of kicked the media didn't actually verify this I mean I took two seconds and I get on and I found a whole bunch of articles that talked about this being a hoax and one of them is the Anti Defamation league\nThey know a little bit of something about hatred and stuff and trying to vet things and they come out and says how the this is the name of the article how the okay symbol\nBecame a popular trolling gesture okay and what that means if you've been on line people troll for pictures in people's faces I Do it you know I go on here since into my of little mini arsenal that I've been feeding around to different people so they can come out things that she posted\nThat are in in contradiction to think she said I mean she claims to be the architects of Obamacare then she tells everybody she can't stand the systems too expensive well you claim to be the architecture thanks for given us this piece of junk you know and so you kind of work yourself through these and look for it and one of the pictures that these people are fooling four\nIs when people hold up to okay side\nNow the case I was always the case that I have kids in sports I use it to kind of say have done well okay or somebody's been up there somebody asked me a question I say oh can I make the gesture to them what happened is there's this group called for change and it's like a weird little a website That's out there and people post pictures means if you don't know what that is it's like a\nA picture that you might end up in the first time there was some joke across the picture or some wording that catches your attention it may be funny and maybe derogatory it could be inappropriate can be a lot of things right so they find their way there wasn't this case so they went through this and did a bunch of research on this was way before uh Jennifer here this is um [noise]\nI bet they did post is in September fifth\nBut it comes on and says I'm well\nThe OK sign and what they're saying is that three fingers that are up are W and the the old for the okay is actually the top part of a peace so there's your white power right that's what they're saying now they go into this deep and they get deep into it to really find out here that came up with so they um [noise]\nOkay hand gesture originated as one of these hoaxes in February of two thousand Seventeen when a non amiss\nFor chatter that's what they call people that post on for Chan announced operation oh K. K. K.\nThis individual had posted\nThings out there but here's what he said he was telling other members on Twitter and other social media pages we must flood Twitter and other social media websites claiming that okay hand sign as a symbol of white supremacy\nThey use or even provided helpful graphic showing how the letter W. P. for the white power like I mentioned can be traced within a okay gesture the originator and others also suggest to use for ... to help spread the hoax\nSuch as hatched take power and privilege and hash tag not okay and they quote it says you're left is have dug so deep down into their lunacy you wrote that poster\nWe must force them to dig more into the rest of society ain't going anywhere near that blank so this whole stir was actually kind of a right leaning individual\nPuts this up there so that these left these will grab it and go crazy with it which they did\nAnd then to the point where this poor dinner for the call does get smashed show hard even lost her job over this\nAnd you know what I think she has some kind of um I don't know I'm not worried obviously but you think you should have some kind of retribution or come back to her employer because there's no verification that this is real and that as legitimate but nonetheless this person did this in February ... doesn't Seventeen and got the left to go nuts\nAnd now they made a big stink out of it and now we're finding out this is a hoax and you go back and you can find this anonymous poster but he did on Twitter and other places in a time frames all match the picture that I even mentioned I saw here it is an believable but that just goes to show you\nWhat it's all about the other day my daughter was in class and one of her teachers made mentioned um about global warming and said that she had read something I think I've got the story correct and that it was absolute oh actually it was in discussion with our family member she had mentioned she read something about Donald Trump\nAnd I said and that that's why she felt that way she didn't say what site what source what it was in place that she read\nSo my daughter just said OK and tried to figure it out but it couldn't get there I said to my daughter you know next time somebody says something like that you need to say hey\nYou know that Abraham Lincoln invented the Internet and the person I mean what are you talking about and then finish it by saying why read it somewhere once\nAnd it just shows you that you know you have to get to the point where you verify legitimate information to go here this poor lady Jennifer and I'm sure her friends that were in that photograph as well have felt some really negative impact points as a result of center Hobbs being absolutely careless\nAnd you know what center Hobbs I'd if your listeners some of your trolls are listening is the reality is you can't pick on our private citizens and inappropriate way she's trained her governor do she well she her we the people who she says she wants to represent I Hope Steve Gainer is picking up steam\nGaining momentum and we'll just really take it to Katie Hobbs envy or next secretary of state because I don't want somebody like Katie Hobbs who's willing to be so file and not really understand the information that's in front of her before she make public decorations and shame on the media and my gosh\nIt is sad that we keep hearing this over and over and over again and find a way they're well speaking of media\nAnother story kind of wrap up this segment you've got a person named Mike a present Brzezinski and you know you've heard coffee ... joined the morning and uh she's a ... now really crazy I mean she comes out and she says I'm\nTrump is not fit for office okay now have you heard anybody say that before I think I've heard that for a few times by the left right\nThen he comes out and surprise them they watch all these declaration they see the private or public negotiations that he does with different people\nAnd they go oh he might we might not like what he says but at the same time we think he's fit you know as far as metric passed and such and then I Want to talk a little bit about it when we come back and it may not be the most exciting thing in the world for to listen to what do you know about the twenty Fifth Amendment\nHow do you replace a dove or president right how do you what happens if they do start to lose their faculty is what is the process so she suggests\nIn her comments that people in quotes should take a look at the twenty Fifth Amendment or something else so there's two things that are happening was present ski one side\nAre saying you know hey whatever give it up here like the the millions that person that has said this and you haven't made any progress year\nTo twenty Fifth Amendment is a little bit legitimate\nWay of taking the proper steps to somebody's not fit for office no question about but then she said\nThe the story Daniel's comments this week about horse face I mean look he is definitely somebody that dance is on the grade when he when he is he likes to when he likes to be successful he spikes the ball on a routine basis but that comment some of the you may say well\nThat right on President and somebody may say why do you have to say that you know so maybe you don't like that doesn't make him incompetent doesn't mean that you his policies are helping to facilitate good trade reduction or national debt or the unemployment rate than the lowest\nFor and especially for African American Hispanics and you start going straight down his L'Engle my gosh look what's happening and then you see policies in process that are put in place that are going to be for a very very long time how about this one Supreme Court you may not like him\nAnd you may not think he's a conservative president but I got to tell you Donald J Trump\nWith his appointments on the Supreme Court has changed this country for at least forty to sixty years\nSweet and he may have a shot at one more or two more points that would be saying so what do you like him or not if you ... what would you consider real conservative values you have to be through that point alone he's made a mark on history for ever OK forever\nBecause of the Supreme Court justice takes as well so again you get moving around this whole thing and you like it was yeah but the twenty fifth to mimic come on [noise]\nI don't know if she goes by me I think it is make or Mica\nBut I got to tell me ... you know I talk about something else why don't you go somewhere productive like wow the jobs quote sheesh look at people's lifestyles are improving\nTheir more jobs than there are people to fill the jobs

fantastic day all these things we were going into the break and I was talking about Nancy Pelosi who my gosh this is one person\nWhere I feel like I've encountered multiple times in my life because I met a lot of crazy people and I just kind of reference back to Nancy Pelosi and think oh my gosh I don't know if you've heard her speak some times or watched her on video where she is very uncomfortable for content\nShe literally have these nervous too which is like you see people that do public speaking even President Obama when President Obama spoke off teleprompter he had a rough time\nGetting through things he was the master and he quite headed\nThat difficult to string together more than just one thought and I don't think it's because he was dumb necessary it's just hard to be a public speaker and the talk all the time but all the issues Nancy goes there well here's one if I was a democratic candidate I Would ask Nancy Pelosi the shot her mouth\nBecause she is making all these public declaration that issue if they win back the house and of course she believes that she'll be elected speaker of the house again which would be terrifying but that she will take up more legislation for gun control\nAnd laws that would support and help illegal aliens illegal aliens it just makes me wanna fall over in my chair but to stay on this topic\nHere's the headline on roll call polls seem not willing to trade over border or trade over border wall calls it Trump manhood issues [noise] okay\nSo what Nancy Pelosi is suggesting that um [noise] maybe our president doesn't feel adequate and\nNancy Pelosi when she was talking about Trump's manhood she wouldn't go as far as talk about the wall really she just said it was not going to be a ... it wasn't going to be as effective as he thinks it will be\nAnd it won't work well let me tell you something okay we know that walls don't work their ladders their tunnels and such as it relates to the masses it does work okay so for a small select groups like the drug cartels and such\nBut then when it does it slows down the volume of slows down but the one thing I like about it more than anything it's disillusion right\nSo of course Nancy says it won't work but then there is no solutions on the heels of what would work so we know the human sector they have some very creative\nTechnology and things that they've used ended up it's like almost zero porous I mean it's like if somebody makes or wherever that border than human sector chances are they're going to go find their way into a missile proving ground\nAnd to me eat something that they don't want to eat like a bomb falling on top of their head and so the military is very very particular how they do that but they've got a little bit of a buff\nSo they've got these great cameras at the end of the Mexican or over the ... over our border into Mexico it goes like a mile either way they have infrared that motion detection they've got walls they've got everything right\nThis all the above strategy which presidents did outline a napkin made its way around this all above strategy is something that is smart and it's efficient and effective and it's cost effective\nBut Nancy wants to just say hey doesn't work it's it's easy to be critical\nBut here's the deal so when I was interviewed on Jay show he asked me what is your solution I said the first thing we have to do\nIs build a wall and he was like well come on that just to have how I Am too easy and I said well\nI said why is it so easy this is my strategy and he said why why is it so easy and I said well here's the deal\nHow do you deal with any of the interior enforcement right so we have drug cartels human trafficking that drug distribution we've got a lot of other illegal behavior that happens crimes and such are prisons are schools or hospitals or infrastructure is getting hammered by people that are coming\nIn and not participating are contributing to the system so it's hard to repair\nWhen we're breaking things down faster than we repair them right\nSo how do we deal with it is interior enforcement if we don't secure the border\nI mean because look if you've heard it once you've already twice you've heard it three times where people get deported they come back they get deported they come back to get deported they come back\nWhen you have a porous border they're still going to have the same impact points on our economy our crime our education system our health system not to mention all the other illegal behavior that's happening around those illegals that are crossing\nIn a way that's not consistent with the law so be as nice as I can\nI don't want anybody in this country they shouldn't be here is a contributor I don't want anybody in this country that doesn't have the value or can't express the value of being a U.S citizen\nLook I Love it yes we are a nation of immigrants but do you know that even an Ellis Island if people had like a store\nThey were turned away I mean come on I mean they were there was a process before that was easy and clear then it just as time has gone on it's become more complicated because that richness of Being American the belief in the American dream continues to entice the masses right\nLet's just say that that's it so we want to do with the right way or the other thing that's really critically important here\nIs that there's people in this nation\nThat do it the right way who am I ... one person I Love\nAbout doing the right was Bram resident of channel twelve\nThat guy is liberal that guy will put out the the tears and um the handkerchief for all these undocumented people that are being arrested and deported but if you ask him he did it the right way he's from Canada he became a U.S citizen did the right way why in the world\nThan they do it the right way why because you know just the right way he want to have conflict disruption as life or anything on the back and\nHe's a contributor as much as I don't like him contributing to our news cycles he's a computer right one way or the other in my mind he's got a right to everything that I Do\nFirst Amendment his political views even though I Do not like them he spends a lot of the information I think in the wrong way and quite honestly I've never really develop relation with the guy but I don't need to because he took the right steps
