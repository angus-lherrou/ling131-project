Joseph Martinez with clear title a weapon let's use a little bit about you and then we'll dive into the show\nYeah absolutely thank you Jason and I have to agree with you when you work in an industry where you have such great relationships and clients it really it makes coming to work so easy and little bit about clear title locally owned and operated as a matter of fact our headquarters is just about a half mile down the road here on camel back\nI we've been in business now ten years we had eight branches across the valley everywhere from arrowhead\nToo may said Apache junction Gilbert Scottsdale paradise valley you name it they were there so we're definitely here to help you with all your real estate needs questions concerns marketing\nOnline digital print we do it all so you're

twenty four the gal back now so just right down the road you work out of this officer no actually I work at a two offices Mason Tempe gotcha I saw all over the valley do just like you Josh you know wherever the client is wherever the need is that's where we are going to go and get it taken care of\n[noise] they were gonna have a great show today why don't we start to show off with a market update by Josh Earnest off let's do it with our way\nHey so I Would start the market update with interest rates and today it says basically that even if you were as a practitioner you couldn't guess what rates are going to do [laughter]\nRight stuff there uh you know race or what they are they're not going to drop ... got to deal with it [noise] moving\nUp still hits still historic hey you know what though still very historic lows I mean over the course of the ...\nI'm not to be a Debbie Downer there there are about the highest they'd been seven years but still um compared to when I started in the mortgage industry I was selling Thirteen percent interest rate mhm uh\nYou know now I'm selling you know five percent ... still cheer still a great rate and have you can complain about\nYou know and I'll talk about so that later you know it's our our economy you know Saddam right now you couldn't get much better and I'll I'll die metal a bit later in the market update but as it is that continues to get better I don't see rates really decreasing ... just as my taken most people say yeah so\nWhat you're saying um purchase volume a gained a small small percentage up from August September um you know slowing down a little bit I'm home price appreciation gains\nDid not increase um so that's that's a little bit of a drawback um construction though is is on the uptick I'm spending on on construction is now up six and a half percent so that's awesome you're you're from August of last year [noise]\nUm let's see what else would go a\n... something that's interesting to eighty pie a report in September the payroll was up two hundred and thirty thousand so people are making more money the kind of what I was talked about earlier the economy\nUm this is a big deal with the global economy right now I'm U.S Canada and Mexico I'm having making progress on our trade agreements\nTo show that you know basically it's kind of the stance that we're having with China that is possible to get something done 'em and then there's all kind of wrap this up with the theme of the market up to its been our economy being so good um [noise] the fed Federal Reserve chairman injure Jerome Powell said this Tuesday\nThat we have the remarkable a positive outlook on the U.S economy\nUm that were on the verge of historically rare era of ultra low employment unemployment and teen prices for the foreseeable future\nJust to be the kind of idea and this this will blow your mind the size of the U.S economy is Nineteen trillion ... trillion ... this year the economy will grow by three point one percent which will add the five hundred and Ninety billion to our GDP okay\nJust that increase not not a total economy but just the increase of this year\nIs bigger than Taiwan is a whole almost as big as Argentina and wondering twenty second as the largest GDP in the world wow in one just the growth in one year pretty credible incredible got a pretty good here while I'm feeling pretty patriotic at the Patriot\nAct as you should [laughter] as you should nice to a lot of red white and blue in the studio there from digging it up so it's good you know I like the studios just because it's a little more intimate you know other studios that we've been in have just been massive you you and you have everyone so spread out it actually\nTo me on looks like a radio station you know some of them\nHave it [laughter] that's funny that's funny\n[noise] hey so um we are the real estate power this is your real estate power or air and every Sunday from five to six\nSo make sure you tune into that kind of mixed in with the football right before the uh you know what is it will succumb to their ... yeah you got a little little cough coffee she just push the button ...\nProfessional [laughter] he's like just like Josh is and it's like it's first time he's like he's been damaged by all this stuff where I've been doing it for years about yeah exactly I've never had a cough drop [laughter] hey Joseph what are we talking about you for a minute um [noise]\nUh you have a topic their home valley prices valley home prices what's\nStill on the rise we're uh taking a look at some of the statistics sent this report is coming back from August although the story was just printed a couple of days back but\nThe valley home prices are still continuing to rise and it looks like the region or the market as a whole had a seven and a half percent increase compared to August of two thousand Seventeen students only look at housing prices we always talked about the oh Seventy eight of the world\nIt's still looks like we're about eleven percent below those Pete prices according to this story going forward so it's really interesting to see where the market's going\nThere saying that on average than new Phoenix market housing price is about two hundred and thirty one K. which seems a little low does that sound ... sound in line\nSounds a little low to me I thought so too and I read it it was interesting yeah\nI mean ... it does sound though for definitely for these valley but you know there's still some some lower home prices on the west I think that's probably\nHave some of the outlying areas dragging down yeah some of the outlying areas as well\nSo yeah so based off that you know they're talking about where the actual markets heading and what it looks like and I and I like this because we're talking specifically the Phoenix area with what you said Josh with interest rates continue and ... and going where they're going it almost seems you know I Know historically speaking of uh Thirteen or fourteen percent rate\nIt seems hard for a new home buyer somebody barely entering the market\nTo grasp that concept but this is what it was in the past versus this is what it is now right so what does that look like you know what does that look like when you talk to a first time homebuyer a millennial somebody entering the market for the first time\nAnd and that's the whole reason we do this radio show and we've been doing it for Fifteen Years in about seven hundred and fifty episodes\nOf live Radio's because even if we can every week if we can just help one or two people\nGet into that pride of homeownership again and and own a home when they didn't think that they had that snowball's chance\nYou don't just make the call and the first call you want to make us to Josh in the stall at a mere first financial just to see where you're at six o two three seven seven Nineteen Seventy nine so we began the segment the conversation that I have with first time homebuyers\nIs a lot of them you know in a lot of cases if you're renters first time home or they may be strapped for cash a little bit sure downpayment wise and over the past six months Josh we've gotten a lot of first time homebuyers in for literally zero out of pocket absolutely and there is a science there's a there's a\nYou know it's it takes a little bit of ... going to get someone in with zero out of pocket and that comes all the way down to the negotiating with the cellar which would be my job negotiating with the seller of the home to include seller concessions so the seller of the home covering my buyers closing costs\nAnd uh there is a little bit of a science to that you know you have to have that experience and I think the twenty five years experienced in real estate kind of get your foot in the door on stuff like that where you can negotiate but it's not that easy on first time homebuyer homes no not at all adding that to happen\nIf it's not that easy um you know doing to Jason's point yes we do a lot of deals where you know we do downpayment assistance programs there's there's several in in the valley um\n[noise] you know there's a ... that got alone closing tomorrow that the conventional loan where they're doing a five percent down payment system phone and they're really getting them closing costs so it could what Jason said is\nYou know they're basically walking that home for home inspection that was pretty crazy yeah they got Seventy five hundred dollars in um tell her pay closing costs\nAnd they're not making a down payment so\nUm men believe it or not sometimes they're still not be [laughter]\n[noise] ... well what do you mean by that\nI mean just oh so here's what I mean by that I guess so and I guess I shouldn't say unhappy but I'm just to let listeners know if you do a down payment assistance program ... you kind of would have to expect but not all people do you're going to take a higher interest rate\nBecause it's got a bit higher taken give right right and given take\nSo sometimes people will complain about the raid on on these dumping assistance programs but you have to understand you're you're getting you know in this instance the they were getting um like I think fifth almost Fifteen thousand dollars he didn't die in assistance money yeah it was alone it was alone just under three hundred grand so\nTo keep that money in the bank though and just pay a little higher interest rate a lot of times that works for people have said well and and that's the big difference and then being able to actually get into a home and not continue to rent for the rest of their life\nYou got to have your own home they wouldn't have been able to um\nYou know they were they were very surprised that they were able to purchase um especially with the conventional loan so now I mean I'm I'm ecstatic yeah and they ... they found a home real quick yup which in the ... and Jason that you know that if you're one Supreme Court but you've got a jump on it you do I mean you can't you can't sit around\nYou do [noise] um [noise] out of state lenders online lenders yeah are they are quite a few of those out there just

them before jumping to that 'cause I I wanted to hit on had on it anyways\nJust adjacent point call us you don't need twenty percent down to buy a house right okay you absolutely don't need twenty

time if we can get that sold before it even hits the MLS you're not going to have a bunch of people Trump's than in and out of your home all the time I'm In on most of the homes that we live by the way\nI show up and demonstrate myself just to me by the art well so people aren't a company you know unaccompanied coca into your home so let's say you're selling your home how could it be to have your realtor ... show up at each showing demonstrate your property because I Know the home veteran any real turn that comes in there\nNow you're now you're not talking the ... you're talking to listen engine\nThat's listing agent I'm going to show up and walk the buyers agent and the buyers through you know through every single room extra extra milder extra mile or go to what it's all about but that's how we get homes sold typically within the first week or so what's your most case let's hear\nA feedback on that do they appreciate that they're not like it\nThey do what's funny is a lot of real estate in South or they're afraid to do that to actually demonstrate their clients' homes because they're like well the ... going to have\nHave me for it right well no they don't actually because when you show up and you walk them through your kind of doing their job but you're doing it ten times better because no one knows the home you are listening better than you do and especially in these customers we saw a lotta custom home tired dollar stuff\nThere it's a realtor comes in with their buyers they're going to miss Ninety percent of the features in the home that you as the lifting age at the ... better than anyone out there can show them\nAnd then you you demonstrate and kind of give them their space\nOh yeah one just got an exit let 'em cruise to check it out and but what you want to do is you want to show up to that home early pop on all the lights bright not home up um you know I show homes quite often a virus and I walk into him and their dark ... but there's on occasion\nUh lifting agents that will coach there buyer into or coach there a seller into turning on all the lights before I get there and when you walk in and it's like night and day literally\nThat's so funny to your point I'll make it short I had a another ages I'm working with show a home late at night and of course they don't like it because it's too dark\nIt's just dark you got to have the place fired up and ready to go [noise] so anyway we have some great coming soon properties we have a couple of listings in the bridges at Gilbert out at he gleaned queen creek arguably one of the nicest master planned communities with lakes mud biking trails throughout I mean it's just a beautiful community\nYour opinions a little skewed there well I live in [laughter]\nI Do but it is nice I mean it's a it's a go to place I mean home cell and they're pretty quick so we got one that's a\nLittle on the higher end six hundred some on thousands going to hit the market um and we have another one that is right across from the park that looks like it's going to hit the market soon as well right about the five hundred and five and a quarter mark\nI'm so we have several high so they're going to be hitting the market soon um some of them about a week and a half away so much among next week's show but why don't we talk to Joe severe Taylor Martian in the east valley what's going on there Joe so they\nJust came out with a huge announcement or looks like that a billion dollar deal clothes or for whom acquisition projects all throughout the nation\nLike ... billion be with the building [laughter]\nSurely you're like in the stock market up to him [laughter]\n[laughter] but uh there's multiple markets that they're actually going to be coming in ah Phoenix being one of 'em Charlotte North Carolina rally Dallas Fort Worth Orlando and even Jacksonville, Florida the thing with the project is that the location\nIs still undisclosed are asking if we knew all do we know it's going to be in the east valley somewhere and they're looking at about a thousand plus new homes new ball coming to the area\nAnd specifically targeting and this is exactly the verbiage that they're going to be specifically targeting millennials and fifty five plus\nBuyers so it'll be interesting to see how they intertwined that demographic\nTo making a master planned community to fit all\nYou know where I think this is going is just south of east mark yeah Mm I'm almost positive that's where they're going to go there some building going on there already you know not not tell them or something but you're doing a lot of the infrastructure and getting ready but there's there's going to be an influx of I I think about a thousand homes are so right there South Park I that's my guess\nQuick question just sort of round table at ... why do you think they're trying to build it to fit millennials and fifty five plus uh like [noise]\nYou know it's a great question I think\nWith the state of the market and increase has come in the way they are targeting both demographics rather than specifically target one optimize has the potential to sell at the community quicker mhm and for top dollar so you know the prices out they're gonna be reasonable in a sense but obviously at the same time target\nBoth demographics you know it's an interesting question when my thought\nIs that it's really the same demographic because you've got millennials who are buying first time kind of starter homes\nAnd you've got fifty five plus that are probably buying down possibly ... you're getting rid of their ... on five hundred thousand square foot home they want something more manageable you know Eighteen hundred twenty two hundred two hundred square foot home boom\nGreat but I don't know if that's that's kinda my thought but I could be wrong I Would say I would say you're spot on actually spot on\nLine [laughter] that would get him some I've ever heard that from drew in about a comment that I've made all all come on man [laughter] usually of a four letter word out there [laughter]\nI Do have to agree though I like button [laughter] what's your answer better than mine that makes sense [laughter] oh that's great you have a couple of hours here which one do you want to want to really hit 'em ... murders ... left their job got Jeremy\nAbout six months or so where are we talking about ... I Want to talk about we can maybe hit that but let's talk about um [noise]\nThe ah there is owner and our taxes and the and you guys are going to last me the lure as I Am I saying\nAlright yeah business it's not it's not clear if lured flu or there right so um\nSo what what the average let me just ask you as you guys are out there and you do is to just sort of our our property taxes are overall you know income taxes state you know taxes what do you think of their high low what do you think we ... I think relatively compared to the rest of the nation I Would say we're low okay Jason\nThe war there was going to come out of my mouth is reasonable and that's why we have so many people coming from northern California Southern California New York Chicago you know a lot of the big cities throughout you know pick it up and opening businesses here or just pick it up and moving here sure what are you seeing Josh\n[noise] so we were in the twenty seventh the best of the nation tax wise so slightly slightly over the middle of the pack pack right so um you know I'm not quite sure where where we why we would be about ... will be better to because purely out of the only thing I deal with on a day to day as our property tax\nAnd like you said compared to California and New York Chicago or extremely low but I don't do much lending and say like Kentucky or um you know the some of those states who knows what the property taxes there are there could be even lower than us\nRight but take that in consideration\nAlso that were the sixth largest city in the nation true I mean we are a huge ... area to open a business and to take advantage of the population growth and the existing population you know I I Believe\nSo the ... um say was right into the white boy I wanted to bring this article up is you know we have a of you know very good um [noise] ranked tax state\nAnd that's that's you know driving businesses into the valley um for example the Amazon or higher and now this isn't necessarily valley but the statewide hiring Fifteen hundred people that are new facility in Tucson okay\nI'm In ... info say among if I'm saying that right thousand jobs here in Phoenix um here's a huge one that I've talked about before ... which is a huge I'm kind of a [noise]\nI don't know the word I'm looking for but uh they're given their opening a place with twenty five hundred jobs in Gilbert twenty wow All right I'm a Nick Nick ...

your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThey crossed grades have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects their body sure so the way stress affects the body is this person is under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles and up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right at the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel that shows that most of the arteries know of and the mothers the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive\nTract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in heart disease digestive difficulties\nYet I Want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that it's completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel for this and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their how many ... at issue it\nHas to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah it does\nBuild your ... but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys you and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet yeah and so it was from the bones themself\n... orbit back from the bones of ...\nThat's right but I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen\nYeah okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian\nFood they're irradiated um the calcium as we turn the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium in absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy a house which started right right right but these things don't absorb and the body\nHappening for a couple of reasons one when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in it like Tom's first of all calcium absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment\nBut see what happens when you take a Tom antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that\nPowder and what happened to put it in hot water and you mix it up and drink it down so in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd who knew that she could have such a huge political influence but I'm six hundred and thirty nine million results on Google type into Taylor Swift politics all within the last\nSeventy two or so hours can you imagine six hundred and thirty nine million results comments thoughts tweets\nUm [noise] the funny thing about this is a I Am just going to have to assume that for those who are delight is in her coming out as a Democrat and condemning and particularly Tennessee\nCondemning has the right word I'm One might have said criticism but no she actually condemns or Marsha Blackburn who's running for Senate a woman I I Know a little bit and very much admire uh she actually does condemn or\nA one has to wonder um if Taylor came to any of this on her own let me just read you I mean she is she is quite the lyricist but let me read she was she wrote on her Instagram a call or account\nI always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for human rights I Believe we all deserve in this country always having always will that comes with some level of persuasion knowing that she's twenty eight\nOne assumes she's been voting every\nYear ... and she's been Eighteen or given the way her birthday falls that would be I'm and basically over the last eight years so [laughter]\nI always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I Believe we deserve in this country [noise] I Believe in the fight for el GB T. Q. rights\nAnd that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong capitalizing each letter in the word wrong [noise]\nUm I Believe most people believe that by the way I Believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying\nSickening and prevalent I Would like an example\nOne example of systemic racism never mind prevalence of it I really would I have set on this show and I believe to my heart and soul that racism is one of the worst things in the world\nI also believe that in America it is very hard to actually find systemic racism which is why they put the word systemic in it again the bigger the lie the more readily it will be believed\nSystemic racism where as prevalent truly where is it yes it would be terrifying and yes it would be sickening but where is it\nI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all Americans all all caps no matter their skin color or gender\nOr who they love [noise] I have to tell you that it might do well for Taylor since she is now waiting into these very serious issues\nTo actually read what conservatives view about civil rights and how we judge people and how it is not the color of their skin that we judge than we do not judged by the color of their skin and do not want to judge by the color of their skin\nThings having to do with employment and hiring or education and admissions ... we we conservatives are the ones who don't judge anything by color of skin\nWe've conservatives are the ones who believe that the color of their skin should be totally irrelevant you look at what's going on at the ivy leagues particularly the lawsuit down Bob and Harvard and admissions you look at what's going on in\nRegard to any employment or any employment agency or any human resources agency of any company or any admits missions office at any college with the possible exception of Hillsdale\nAnd there is a lot of lot devoted to the color of skin\nAnd whether someone who's going to benefit from the color of their skin or someone who's going to lose out of the benefit based on the color of their skin\nIs Taylor Swift cares about these things truly she might do herself a favor of educating herself a little bit more now one of the interesting things about all of this is that um Twitter is firing\nAll over the place with regard to people who might change their vote and to their vote particularly in the Tennessee elections based on Taylor ... one one of the things I Would have hoped and really liked about country music\nWas how a political it actually was in the music industry\nYou know people assumed it was conservative or Republican\nBecause of two things\nThat it talked about country and faith and family on the one hand and it didn't actually the singers for the most part the performers for the most part didn't get to actively involved in politics it's funny isn't it how those two things make someone presume or create\nThe presumption of conservative Republican\nRight the left keeps telling us patriotism shouldn't have a political party and I agree with that we all should agree with that but isn't it funny that the only music the talks to it people assume this Republican\nWell who's done that [noise] and isn't it interesting that really the only music genre that doesn't do political rallies that they're awards\nOr their concerts they assume that to be Republican because\nTo be all political all the time to be a leftist and if you're not you're a Republican west sad\nSad state of affairs I'm Seth leaps and we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] ah\n\nHave a broken into chip which we have good news for you than any auto glass you can get up to one hundred forty dollars back with
