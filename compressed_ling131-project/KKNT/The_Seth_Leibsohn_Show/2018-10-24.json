this romantically it is the most important thing in our lives it is how we organize\nUm the society we want to live in it is how we organize\nThe air that we breathe in the culture is how we organize\nThe safety and security for our families and the environs in which we want our children to grow for those that lament the money it's in politics don't limit to we spend far more on far less

mayor or Phoenix that group when\nThe most conservative candidate for mayor who could one yeah yeah well I I I'm all in for Moses Sanchez have you heard any of my interviews with him\nOr not\nHe's a great guy he's a great American he has a wonderful biographies got a wonderful story\nUm he is a wonderful family man he is a professor of economics I think not only is he a great candidate for mayor not only do I think he would be a great mayor I think he is a great a representative of the Republican Party in Arizona and nationally [noise]\nOkay well thank you that was easy huh yeah\nMoses for mayor Moses Sanchez reminds me what was the story um let's see if I can get this right this was kind of funny this is around Ninety four Ninety five\nBill Bennett was riding high with the book virtues Charlton Heston I think was\nI don't know if he was speaking for the national Rifle Association in those days or not but has been called bill doctor Bennett and tried to persuade them to run for office I think Senate\nAnd bill Bennett said no I don't think it's for me but you're out there in California you ought to run for Senate and a Charlton Heston said the bill Bennett oh I don't got a book like the ... the virtues bill Bennett said are you kidding me most is you have a much bigger book [laughter]\nPretty good huh pretty funny are you kidding me most is you got a much bigger book well we have our own most us here in Phoenix Moses Sanchez and he is a great guy very accessible to if you go to his website\nOr if you follow him on Twitter um every time I call on Emmys here and um you know the city of Phoenix it's\nJust not been well run just hasn't been look when when the mayor himself for the immediate ex mayor himself who's running for higher office gets mugs mugged on the streets of camel\nBack that's not a good sign that just not a good sign and you know I hate to\nPut it in the terms of him getting my because I Know that there's a huge police shortage here well that's mismanagement that his mismanagement and if you want to know more about that\nFollowed the work on Twitter and elsewhere of our great city councilman celibacy CEO who's been clinging this bell for a very long time he needs help we need help Moses Sanchez is the answer for that\nAnd ah if um if if you're looking for any guidance whatsoever I'm you know there's there's as the Arizona voter guide easy voter guide as we talked about\nUh my friend Dan sent me another great resource by the way I'm especially on the ... judicial retention a recommendations from the free enterprise club we had a spokesman from the free ... free enterprise clubs here the other day [noise]\nSo you can go to easy free dot org and get that information and their recommendations on judicial nominations um so the information is now\nFully out there and\nUh if you are sending in an early ballot or on behalf of you know your favorite candidate and we all have candidates we really like and really support I'd like to know who it is I mean I Know in my case it involved or not only the governor ah but um\n[noise] but some are some people running for the state legislature and in my legislative ditch district as well and\nI'm Glad to and proud to mail my ballot in early on their behalf looking forward to do do see getting another term it will be a I think shellacking of David Garcia who\nYou know has run a just a terrible campaign and I've got to think more than any other democratic race in the state of Arizona this is the one that party must have the biggest worry more about and uh he was running against another guy in the primaries\n... who was I think a much would have been a much better candidate\nBut uh you know there was something for lack of a better word attractive or a sexy into the political sense of David Garcia I'm David Garcia leverage to his last name\nAnd the import of that as if it's important at all I don't think it's any more important than lead soon or Comstock quite frankly nor should it be um\nThe guy's not good he is just so he can't answer a question and a debate he cannot give us his education plan though he touts the fact that he is an educator is education biography at ASU is pretty pathetic for the money he's been paid\nI think he is an empty suit and he's bringing in ... and he's brought in Bernie Sanders to helped campaign for him here in Arizona is Bernie Sanders state\nIs this a Bernie Sanders state I mean this is what either make pink or they just want to pal around with to have fun with\nBut meantime put all that against this great economic record and great management record of Doug DC and it's just not a close contest extrapolate out from that\nTo the stakes in the national representation elections cinema Mick Sally race\nAnd look at the records of both of them look at the public service of both of them look at the public statements of both of them\nAre one of them thought gee hottest ... one of them are protested those who are fighting jihad is set a tough call that a tough call for you and she won't apologize for it and she won't um backtrack on it in fact she defends she defense those quotes\nI think those codes are horrible if you want Michael Moore representing you in the Senate vote for the first in cinema because until I heard her line about joining the Taliban and her defense of it\nA week old she's defending it not only a week ago not not not more than a week ago\nI I I just think it didn't think people have those views in two thousand three outside of the Michael Moore fever swollen but that's where it comes from [noise] one thing to have it and change [noise]\nThey have some right to violence they called themselves the resistance which is the uh the the the imagery of the French against the Nazis which is of course if you can think of Trump is not see a perfectly legitimate reason to engage in violence I mean they've created this they've created this ... theater of them a cob not us\nThey have and and and they don't say anything about when something happens but that they don't say anything about it\nAll right here's an outlier ... Ferran ... here's a news story I'm going to ask you if you knew about did you know did you know that um rice than\nThe poison rice than was mailed last month\nTo Donald Trump at the White House and the defense secretary James Mattis to humble ups to the Pentagon ever wonder though I say about there you go yeah well it came from a a man I don't need to say his name it doesn't matter uh thirty nine year old out of a Salt Lake city\nNo of course you out there that I of course you didn't hear about it because you have to be the right kind of victim in this country for the media to give to dams\n[noise] well you know we have a mob within our country and we have a mob coming towards our country yep I mean it's like it's a good\nPoint point it's a good point and the mob in the country

or the or the the finest clarity that one can ever have in America ... uh-huh\nAnd what they've done is they've revealed themselves and they are now openly accepting of bio ... they have\nUm demonstrated that they no longer accept the peaceful transition of power yup and so which means and what that means that they reject everything else yup they reject the rule of law the declaration of independence the constitution the bill of rights\nEverything so what ... what we have now is a faction of people who no longer accept\nOur form of government that's right as government of the people by the people and for the Nazi goaded yep yep they do not accept that\nThey no longer believe that our votes Mac and they have demonstrated that us both in some things are happening and Brock Obama's administration and by their actions after Trump on the president's\nSee sometimes people how you're absolutely right then and and the question I'm trying to get to his wife and I think we can start with the obvious answer but there's nothing so powerful is that he all gee but beyond that\nYou know some people will say All right yeah so what the media and Hollywood is in the corporate boardrooms and the C suites of corporations are also liberal okay fine big deal\nAnd we'll see here's the problem though it's created this mutually reinforcing narrative that lets the Democrats out large get away with this stuff\nBecause they have I'm not only their echo chamber but they have their egging on chamber through that part of the culture you know there's there's there's there's\nThe exact truth which is what you said that they just don't see us as a legitimate part of the policy but by them saying that they're delete de legitimizing themselves ironically\nBut you know unless someone else picks up on that threat they're just going to continue going down this road I mean the the the sheer hot spot if I can\nUse my French\nOf Hillary Clinton saying it's a troubling time isn't it and it's a time of deep division and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together the week after she says this is not a time for us to be civil until we are back in power\nRight we will batter you our spouse until you comply mhm yes this is horrible psychology it's not compatible with our former governor\nYesterday I did a monologue on um you know I'm the rush to\nLabel everything I'm not

which case we will be pouring gasoline and our bombs what these people don't understand is that Hillary and a bomb at all these people they're standing next to their wonderful cozy fire [noise]\nThrowing gasoline on it [noise]\nStaring at it so they can't see anything else except their own echo chamber but I don't understand is it the fires of revolution will consume them as well I

you may do so you can do so at six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero that's six zero two\nFifty eighty nine sixty love to hear from you I'm Out Toyota with 'em all the news\nI owned a really the ubiquitous news the ... minute to minute coverage of uh what took place with the discovery of these delivered\nA pipe bombs or to the various offices around the country whether they be CNN Obama Clinton's uh it's interesting that two things are true\nOne\nUnless I'm missing something big we know nothing more about this right now for seven PM Phoenix time than we did at nine AM Phoenix time which raises just a question I had of the question is\nWhat is the point of the wall to wall coverage and we know nothing new after so many hours of wall to wall minute to minute second the second coverage stamp eating over the commercial breaks for which I guess I'm grateful\nBut you do understand the point here don't you of what cable news has to do and does and what it gets you get you virtually nowhere virtually nowhere that's one thing the second thing is true is that if CNN we're not\nUh the recipient of one of the packages and it was delivered to John Brennan at the ... uh CNN or not CNN specific generally\nIt was ... delivered wrongly by the way John Brennan works from MSNBC I'm it would not be covered like this every anthropologist was sewn tribe the media is no different\nWould not be covered like this if there weren't also an attendant raw is overweight\nOr left wing ... and violence\nThird thing that is true\nI knew I knew that when Hillary Clinton addressed the she would do so poorly Arab ally and terribly and she did she did she was at a political event this morning\nBy the way I find it very interesting the Jim Acosta CNN is telling Donald Trump issued cancel his political events this morning a disaster for this evening Jim Acosta of CNN [noise] selling\nHis followers his listeners viewers his Twitter readers that Donald Trump should not be engaging in a political rally or a political event tonight well Hillary Clinton today spoke at a political event in Florida campaigning for Donna Shalala did you know she was running for Congress\nHere's what she said can you play the audio for me Mr Mr Comstock\nBut it is a troubling time isn't it [noise]\nThis time of\nThe\nDivisions [noise]\nAnd we have to\nDo everything we can to bring our country together [noise] we\nAlso have to\nElect candidates will\nAs what I said about that here's what I said about that thanks Anthony here's what I said about that in the first hour can we break this down a little bit she starts by saying this was a troubling time isn't it why is it a troubling time\nI was a troubled were you enjoyed our country's conditions of late it's troubling to her because she's not the president it's troubling to her supporters because they didn't win literally that can be the only definition of why it is a troubling time\nSome one of the economic and other facts on the ground of this country we call America since one of a ever been better\nShe then goes on to say it's a time of deep division why is it a time of deep division a lot of us did not go round marching and shouting not my president a lot of us voted for the president and we're very much forward\nVery much looking forward to the peaceful transition of power to him just as when her husband won the election from a Republican administration and candidate that preceded his tenure\nAs a deeply divided because Donald Trump did not win a majority of the popular vote well neither did Bill Clinton in Nineteen Ninety two\nIf it's a time of deep division I can guarantee you because it is by definition that the division is not coming from the party and people in power that's by definition\nIt's from those who lost power and didn't get the power they hope for or felt entitled to after all\nIt is she Hillary Clinton who a week ago just a week ago said you cannot be civil to those who oppose you politically until we are back in power meaning she and her party that's\nYou said that a week ago her she Hillary Clinton the one who says it's a troubling time isn't it\nTime of deep division isn't it\nShe's the one who called for an civil disobedience may not be bombs delivered are mailed\nBut it's not civil and peaceful either\nWhen you say now is not the time to be civil\nHas only one meaning uncivil and an civil means violent anyone calling her out on this why does anyone still listen to her honestly I don't know I don't know Hannah Arendt said there's nothing so powerful\n...\nWell I suppose there you have it but don't lecture us about times of deep division in times of trouble all we did was vote Kyle is in Phoenix Hi Kyle\nHi Seth how you doing I'm well how are you know there's not very well thank you um\nI've only seen one picture one image on a social media about the package on the packages and assuming it was one that was now the CNN does anybody have any confirmation that there's actually went through the postal service\nNo actually I'm a ... year right to raise it I don't know what it exactly means except for investigative purposes but I did see a report saying that it was delivered by courier\nOkay yeah because it it all but she doesn't have the postage on it\nWell it may or may not but it certainly doesn't have canceled postage on it\nIt got cancelled the one I saw it didn't have the right right not only that but\nThe the postal employees are trained\nI mean very very well they're trained very well on how to isolate\nIdentify factors oh yeah just like that I absolutely I saw a demolition expert earlier saying you know anyone in their first year\nWorking in in in in a federal office dealing with packages and deliveries\nFrom you know if they work for the government that this would have all the markings of something suspicious just by the way it was packaged and address yeah absolutely yeah I was just wonder if there was any ... well yeah I didn't see a story and I don't remember if it was a pie or otherwise but it was a a story from a major news source that ... that had said at least that\nOne looks to be um delivered by career okay even though I had stamps on it\nTo be part of the mystery we'll figure out and find out more about no doubt we will find out who this was we always do I hope so yeah we well we definitely will and it'll take a lot less time than it took to find the Unabomber Bob is in Phoenix Hi, Bob\nA high ... I Know switch topics you have to remind but just the hypocrisy that serve\nAs an immigration I wanted to stay to case you want to do you remember when Janet Reno was there and that Cuban boy\nA youngster Kelly and Gonzales I'll never forget his name I ever forget his name I never will and the Democrats and Clinton and\nThe other lady Janet Reno said no you know the picture an armed guards ... ... ... that little kid back to Cuba ... when he was one of the saddest days of the decade [noise]\nThat's right and the other one that I Know a lot of people that is a little historically fuzzy but they say it's in the late mid thirty ... thirty six thirty seven the German ship that went to Cuba\nSt Louis yeah I think it was a little later but St Louis yeah but you know us at all they do that with\n... with the juice on riot but looking for ... and ... and the Cuban dictator where I live in stock and FDR had the power of this and that ship immigrants\nAre will not let him either yeah FDR would he would come to Miami a throat so\nSo you know they used to it and so this is where they you know now they're just you know what's up for him to the\nElderly I Know there's a lot more than two but [noise] no question about it look as I had a caller Bob thanks for the call I had a caller and the last hour who said something smart about mobs in the country mobs coming in\nThe country are attempting to come into the country it's interesting how the first group is not saying anything about the second isn't it really interesting to me um thanks an awful lot Bob are jays and may so high RJ hey\nBecause it can feed itself and it can create a life of its own and it can create a false impression and narrative\nThere's no reason to whitewash are passed but there's no reason either to not recognize the distance we've traveled and the greatness for which\nWe can all all\nBe proud of duties and Phoenix di di\nDi di di [laughter]\nSometimes you have this fear of abandonment by me I get that you feel that I Need I don't talk about us to talk to your self okay All right for me it's\nA good cycle our\nGet I refer you to a good psychoanalyst um I don't think I can I don't\nKnow do I do and he's going to tell you I don't know any faith that no one he says yes\nI call that to offer a correction please\nYour point that celebrities that are around the fire they felt they don't\nAnd then I'm going to tell you what I say okay first of all I Lived\nIn Los Angeles from Nineteen Seventy Nineteen eighty nine\nOkay thought\nThat this is my question to\nAsk you know I don't know that around the fires they built you know what they do\nThat huh they laugh all the way to the back\nYeah that that was true in other words we could add that yes we could add that\nThere is a grievance industry and by the use of the word industry I mean there are people making money\nOff it absolutely yes that's a fair point I just like the notion of being able to say standing around a fire yelling theater\nOf course that's\nRight that's all I was trying to do that though that they do yes they will tell\nAfter they don't get all the great yup they crave buyer yup okay yep and make gardening I just thought you know what you were saying about the kind of a kind of oil that yeah and you're right it All right it was and then so\nI don't know that that was\nYou know what it was I Know I don't see the I I I just disagree I just I just fundamentally disagree I mean I I you know I think anyone has the right to their political point of view without being denounced as a traitor to their race and he was denounced as a\nTraitor to his race [noise] using racial is ten racist term [noise]\nBy the likes of the panel on CNN San Juan Williams and then they questioned his mental stability which is\nAn emblem of Marxist dictatorships do [noise] but if you don't think right [noise] politically you're mentally disturbed and must be shipped off\nFor have your glasses ground to ... or be punished [noise]\nNo I I I I think they were wrong to use the phrase [noise] and I think it was just such a thing in the way they talk about his mental health is racing a traitor to it in the ... of them is to show\nThese phrases that have been gone for years that they themselves are bringing that they're the ones responsible\nJust as Hillary is and yet they blame us we'll be right back\nIn Ninety sixty new
