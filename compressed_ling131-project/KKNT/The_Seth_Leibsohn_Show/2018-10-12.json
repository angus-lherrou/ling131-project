right to conscience of a conservative and the Barry Goldwater movement was to go after the new deal so so some of that changed if you want to use the word moderated you could do that I suppose but look at some of the issues we've talked about today race\nThere is nothing close to any agreement between the two parties on the ... that's\nWhy that's why they have to try to recreate the old issues

you about what they said on CNN about him with Don limited calling him a token negro when the commentators called him a token negro another one said this is what happened when negroes don't read now calling a black person a negro in the year twenty Eighteen is a slur\nAnd I guess he's black commentators believing get away with it because a lot of them for white people don't realize calling a black person the negro and twenty Eighteen is easily so offensive\nAnd I put somebody down 'cause that's what they're doing they're getting away with bigotry\nAnd Kanye West\nSays he grew up without a father\nAnd told a President Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered him\nAnd it is far and away the number one problem in this country the number one problem in the black community the

demise of the family\nMy friend well to Williams and Thomas all have written about the black family after slavery\nA black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof or the biological mother and biological father than today\nAnd after slavery because\nFor years it was illegal for slaves to marry\nIt was a huge uptick and Mary and if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely\nTo be brought into the world with a biological mother and a biological dad under the same roof than a white kid more likely and then along comes the welfare state and dependency and the LA Times ... poor people to non poor people questions about welfare and about dependency they asked the question to Nineteen eighty five they asked him again or in twenty fixing\nDo you believe welfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet\nAnd they asked poor people in non poor people those questions forty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent felt that he gave you a stepping stone or to get on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare which harmful\nAs so that it was helpful\nSo don't you think maybe just maybe that's worth looking at\nBest a topic worthy of discussion as many poor people think that welfare is bad or ethnic it's good and about eight percent or so have no idea to do I have an opinion one way or the other\nThat is a boatload of people on welfare who believe that it's created dependency\nAnd that's what Kanye West we're talking about you don't think it's worth having the conversation of course you don't know if you're on the left because you look into the

behalf of people that I think I'd been wrongly in prison how good a because the justice of ... you don't count all the time yep and um until you and that's but that's one of those those foundational things that grandma Vivian gave me way back in Nineteen\nSeventy four it's important to consider to Richard is a classical liberal in it and to keep in mind I ... and and I think it's worth reminding

congresswoman Kirsten Sinema has passed\nA the most recent of audio or that we had heard over and was written about this morning's Arizona Republic was her criticizing Arizona and Arizona Republicans as crazies\nAnd worse [noise] there's a new piece of audio that's just out and I think it's even more politically fatal and a two and a two thousand three interview\nKirsten Sinema was speaking with a radio host um who said\nQuote as an individual if I Want to go fight and the Taliban army I go over there and I'm fighting for the Taliban I'm saying that's a personal decision Kirsten Sinema responded fine I don't care if you go and do that\nGo ahead no mind you the timing of this this was two thousand and three we knew an awful lot about the Taliban\nTwo thousand three some of us have known about it since the late nineties but to say that that's just\nFine I don't care go ahead\nAnd join the army the fighting the United states military movement that's fighting the United states um it's not legal so sub ordination of treason but those who would do that would be guilty of treason\nNot to mention that I cannot think of a more retrograde military or regime then the Taliban you cannot speak for any level of human rights and think it's just fine if someone supports or fights for the Taliban you cannot\nIn any way shape or form state that you're a champion of women's rights Kirsten and\nThink it's just fun to go and fight in the ... and the Taliban army you cannot in any way they think it's okay to be supportive on the one hand of minority rights and yet support and be OK with someone joining the Taliban\nDo we need a lesson again on who the Taliban is\nMind you this is two thousand three and you weren't twelve\nSays two thousand three at the apex of what we knew about the Taliban and how bad it was when I say how bad it was\nI Need a bigger source bad doesn't come close to describing it evil doesn't come close to describing it the closest thing I can get to in describing it\nWas the phraseology of Christopher Hitchens who at the time said when we went to war against Afghanistan it would have been the first time in the history of the world we tried to bomb a country in to\nThe stone age I Believe this audio will be fatal if it isn't it should be and if it isn't she has a lot of explaining to do a lot of explaining how old was she in two thousand three\nHow old was Kirsten Sinema in two thousand three well she was old enough to know that she wanted to be a member of the Green Party she was born in Nineteen Seventy six so in two thousand three that would have made her what\nBill exactly twenty seven pretty dumb at twenty seven to say something like that as I say a lot of explaining to do tennis in Scottsdale Hi Ted\nAri how are you in your article on the magazine in the middle of the Sunday paper\nFantastic\nAnd my friends don't recall\nRussia\nWas\nStart it took Nixon huh I think that's great I think that's\nThe Nixon was in large part responsible for my political coming of age and I guess I had to do with the Watergate hearings because I\nAs a kid loved watching captain kangaroo in I remember they were interrupted you know preempted by the Watergate hearings to Nixon was an early memory for me and I always found him fascinating there's only a couple of people in history I have read\nEvery book about them that I can every biography or political biography about them that I could and Nixon as one of 'em he is always fascinated me a William Buckley once described him as the as tech calendar stone if the twentieth century\nYeah really you don't um you don't have the twentieth century in America without Richard Nixon not the latter half when you think of how many things he was\nHad his hands and fingers in and was involved in ... when you think about it a start with um the his chambers would occur chambers Alger Hiss a investigation that was Richard Nixon right in the um [noise] and that was when he was first ah first elected to Congress and then the Senate from California\nThen of course uh you have him is Eisenhower's a vice president people sometimes forget he was Eisenhower's vice president in the fifties and did a lot to bring the attention to the attention of the United states the evils of communism you may remember his kitchen debate\nWith a with Khrushchev golf\nCourse in ... enough but if you Google at\nThe uh he he you know I I yeah I wasn't I wasn't open up the [laughter]\nUm and then of course you know he as he ran for the presidency in Nineteen sixty and lost and then of course for governor of California and then lost\nThat coming back to power and sixty eight winning I'm his presidential election you know everything um we actually deal with in politics today is almost a fallout from his presidency\nAh including the whole idea of the independent counsel and special prosecutors\nAh affirmative action was created on Richard Nixon's watch the EPA OSHA all of that was part of the Nixon administration certainly China\nAnd are bringing China into the United nations I mean just uh and then of course Watergate and not just the resignation of his presidency but the whole inspiration of all of a of a of a of a of a a coterie of journalists\nA you know who are trying to work in the tradition of Woodward and Bernstein really quite monumental when you think about it\nI'm going to go find it which\nI Try and find out if you do would you email it to me and I'm going to try and find it to\nWork like that was kind of just yes that was like eight years and it was a

know what's funny um you know what's funny about that says stay a minute you know what's funny you know people tell me I'm right I yeah it's right people tell me how conservative I Am\nAnd then they go off on an issue or a person and I realize I'm I'm close to a socialist compared to them it's a funny family this reputation I have for being such a conservative I don't think I'm that conservative and I have some views that probably would offend a lot of Republicans or a fellow conservatives\nI'm not that I'm just telling you it's a funny thing people always told me how conservative I Am and then in you know at dinners or what have you I had a couple of votes occasions this week and then they just go off whether it was on Kavanaugh or ... and or Dr Ford or any number of issues\nAnd I sit there slack jawed thinking you're telling me I'm conservative\nMy gosh I'm Nancy Pelosi compared to you that's a funny funny thing and part of it you know what I think part of it is I think part of it is just the profession I man I think that's part of it and people think\nThis is this is this is just kind of the reputation I guess you get for being a radio host on I can quote unquote conservative station or something also people hear what they want to hear that that's I think eminently true\nWell I'm not that consider health I'm really [laughter] All right hey listen seriously yeah um I I I Want to give you a true though I I'd have to give you a ... that's because I've listened to your show all week I didn't call and\nI listen to every single program all week on the patriots and um I mean it it's so educational your show so educational it's informative\nI mean is chock full of information and I just want to keep you and ... on the back because even the callers I mean it's just so uplifting listening to the show\nWell thank you David and you know we reinforce each other still make steel stronger\nYeah so\nI you know obviously I grew up in England or ... I'm fifty five years old I grew up in the seventies I Would say late teens I grew up in the punk rock movement I'm obviously a British ... movement\nWith different than the American you know in America you wrote my own stuff like that I grew up with the like you know this is\nThe real stuff and it was all the strong strong medicine\nWell there's an argument about that but we won't go that ... ... yeah but\nEverything was ... I mean growing up it was socialist I was you know grow and brought up in a socialist environment it was you know\nDestroy this and break this kind of like a watered down version of empty far yeah he would get it and yeah and I went to hundreds of punk rock gigs and fans at the time you know it was like bring down this let's break this\nI understood the un I enjoyed the music\nThe music was awesome but the message from a law that bans just didn't hit me I'm like why it was ... mentality mentality [noise] and I and the the actual message from the punk rock movement in the seventies and eighties was like\nYou know be independent and ...\nAnd it was just like wait a minute you should take a few steps back and you think I don't want to do that so I think my conservatism in a conservative came out it's like don't be a pop\nYou're raising an interesting point about conservative philosophy David I'm I I Know it's it's fashionable these days for our movement to say it's time to go to Washington and drain the swamp and uh I'm fine with that but but there is this notion of whether it's a greater test\nTo drain the swamp or or or irrigate for us", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Seth Leibsohn Show", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "12"}
