with the\nWith all of you [noise] um [noise] so we'll be welcoming a\nGenerous among the leader ah ... after the segment ah so ah would love to chat with you anything you'd like to talk about we've been talking about uh the UN buddy Ron about the Kavanaugh hearings about culture war whatever's on your mind call me at six o two five eight or nine six zero six oh two five oh wait\nOh nine sixty you know a couple of things been going on that I Want it to update you all on a first of all just reported from\nCanadian media that the Canadian revenue agency\nSuspended the Islamic society of North America Canada is Canada for a year effect of September twelve and ordered them a cigar based charity debate over half a million dollar penalty\nSo it's no ... bison to Canada claims to have no connection to its not America Islamic center is America\nA but in Canada they are also a similarly founded a they are a part of the Muslim Brotherhood legacy groups are they deny association with the Muslim Brotherhood but I call them part of the legacy groups which are those groups that sort of came from the tree if you will\nAnd I'm the to a a country's chapters of those are the NIH any association they may not have any legal or\nOr uh or other type of association formally but obviously ideologically they seem to come or from the same tree so bottom line is is I think this is a big story when you have a country as\nPolitically correct and in denial about Islamism as Canada that now has sided them and uh is uh finding them for contributions to foreign organizations that are involved\nIn terrorism and on other things that were bothering me a that violated a they're a nonprofit status in Canada I think that's significant so hopefully I testified to Congress a few months ago about\nWhy we should move forward and designating branches of the Muslim Brotherhood a a terrorist organization and are not here in the west a thing in the west they don't run by\nAnd be designation so it'd be hard to uh I don't think that we should uh necessarily assume their membership however\nYou target the mother ship in Egypt um branches in Syria in Yemen in ah Iraq and elsewhere\nAnd uh the rest of the branches will die on the vine and be marginalized and the ideas will be marginalized so I think this was a big news story we're going to talk about turkey and Iran are later are also the fact that the cops on American Islamic Relations\n[noise] the one of the primary Islamists lobbyists out of Washington that has worked closely with the Turkish Islamists are are do on a who's a the a cult leader of the Turkish government and the Islam and Saudi Iran which you're talking about with a\nAli before they met with him a real honey and or or to one met with the head of care you know how to widen how they're meeting ever happened is beyond me but they\nAre even proud of it and announced that the other social media let's talk to you or Stephanie in Scottsdale I think she wants to talk about judge Kavanaugh said I ...\nI got together no actually I'm Sorry to take time away from the\nConversation we're having now which I think it's far more important but I just have it is a little showing it sticks in my craw and and he went down there and maybe there is a way for it but\nWhen I hear it on the other side I think that it got it on purpose referring to a doctor afford it Dr Ford and calling judge Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I just think that we should call him judge Kavanaugh amen and I call you got your cats ... title ever expect you earned it okay I'm going away because I Want to hear what you have to say about the middle east they were at least they're listening to my life and\nI I could not agree with you more um it is sometimes we talk about those uh we love and with affection with their first name rather than as we should respectfully uh but uh you are a hundred percent right so thanks for reminding us\nThere and take care of a next the John from Phoenix [noise] doctor great great thanks for being on the ... and show are warm turmeric\nAnd I've never heard anybody make sure that\nWhere is Dr forge harsh but\nWhere is your mother father brother she is got no support at all from our family there are hiding and the only people who are supporting or or the politicians and the\nWell I hear I hear what you're saying and I'm you know being somebody who has also been\nIn sort of the public crosshairs of for many years as I've taken on the Islamist than others ah I think we can understand why family sometimes can\nFor whatever reasons choose to be behind the scenes but then you can see what's happened to judge Kavanaugh's\nFamily um you don't see\nDr Ford's defense team and others coming to the defense of judge Kavanaugh's family so you see sort of a duplicitous approach which is as we talked last hour they're scorched earth approach which is by any means necessary\nOr that they will destroy a this nominee his family and elsewhere or while they're family a match slap pointed out method the head of the American Conservative Union on who's bored I said Matt pointed out on social media I think you mentioned on Fox yesterday that\nWhy hasn't their family even signed the petition\nYou know the the petition and supportive of Dr Ford hasn't even been signed by by them and again ah you know listen I understand why family wants to stay out of the crosshairs they see what's happening to to to her as a result of this too and none of that is is a necessary I think\nA lot of the uh obviously the threats and things like that or go beyond the pale uh but uh still at the end of the day it seems to be one sided ah as far as those things and maybe it speaks to you know you look at\nOur county attorney who did the questioning um her you know Rachel ... I'm\nA ride up and the six pages of\nUm details of lack of cooperation lack of uh this this is a city and other things and you realize that this is you know wouldn't even be picked up by a prosecutor or for investigation let alone to be tried in the jury of public opinion\nYes and I've talked with another individual who is a drug counselor and ... she is a problem with severe alcohol problems\nWell I don't want to go there I I you know I think that that's exactly what they're doing which is to make some ... ah based on things and I don't think\nYou know it takes a there's obviously something we can't deny it takes an unbelievable honor courage to leave your I'm\nComfortable living at Stanford and then decide to\nUh go and make these statements to resurrect things unfortunately she didn't provide her therapist notes that could've corroborated much of this she didn't provide\nA lot of the things I think that could have made her more credible ah but at the end of the day I I don't think two wrongs make her right or they may have the left may have a scorched earth\nApproach to this Saturday Night live may feel it is morally justified to on the one hand and leave Dr Ford sacrosanct there are many areas of comedy\nThat could have been made about her presentation and yet the\nApologist for Harvey Weinstein Matt Damon founded only appropriate to mock judge Kavanaugh and his family so I I find that are quite odd or any other comments John\nI don't I don't watch Saturday\nNight or [laughter] you're smart [laughter] that's\nWhy the other point I've learned over the years it was it whenever I Am a compromise their situation\nWhere I always do will be to memorialize what went on\nWhether it's a rough conversation whether it's worth an employee or supervisor or anything like that I Want more realize it and then send it to two or three people strictly confidential just they're no good at this point in time does happen\nAnd I found that extremely helpful when things go bad I'm able to pull out out here there's just what happened to this day it absurd two or three people you're going to take a look at it\nAnd and tyrants like or to one had played both sides of the equation in Syria or both supporting al ... an ISIS and Muslim Brotherhood groups in addition to now working with Russia and\nAnd Assad interest and others so it's it's sort of a a power issue with them and continuing to have some type of tribal control over Muslims\nThan a reality can you talk about Turkish influence in the United states their influence of now the largest mosque and America was built in Baltimore by\nIt's even called the ... center DNS does the Turkish word for religious establishment to the government if you will and it's built on our soil now the largest American mosque and and so they make no they're not ashamed at all of what their operations are in spreading their Islamist influence into the west\nFor all I've been talking with a different or intelligence or sources and there are concerned about Turkish intelligence stuck\nAnd influence operations in the U.S that they are about Russia or you know you had a huge but some people who are reaching the indicted by Robert Mueller for Rob lobbying on behalf of Russia without a light thing under the foreign agents registration act\nI'm ... and the same time you have a group stare directly connected to order one better or trying to influence us sanctions like back in August you had a group called the museum at us as day which is the a\nBusinessman a wing of the ruling KP ah here in the U.S they are sent letters to the U.

know if it was on Reddit or where was that I read a pages of a list of the contradictions that Rachel Mitchell from Maricopa County attorney's office who did the questioning on behalf of the Senate Republicans are submitted\nBe lifting date date after day July third July eighth August and this is the statements that she made that didn't corroborate from the same and where she said she couldn't

struggled to identify Kavanaugh by name has no memory of key details\nAnd she writes a she said she said is incredibly difficult to prove this case of even weaker than that quote I don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the ... the preponderance of the evidence standard

somewhere else and away from a TV [noise] uh and even my phone and so I heard about it later and look\nI thought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive\nAh and on I\nYou know unconvincing presentation\nWhy would why would they do that's about ... people say well because of roe v Wade or whatever you know I mean that's actually kind of a silly response because uh if you if you actually looked at what what what Brett Kavanaugh's like he's he's very in a way I'm very middle of the ...\nYeah he certainly circumspect on that issue I I Would say I agree with you yeah I mean you know an ...\nHe's been asked time and again and he said it's the subtle ... now you know I mean I could imagine the circumstances coming up where it might be challenge but you know that's\nYeah and of course he gets his or sidelined here I mean the idea that you know slaughtering unborn children the most important thing in the world she says quite a bit\nYounger I was going to have you know I Know that actually be a nice topic for the for another time point you know\nEspecially especially for would yeah especially for ... you know but I don't believe that to one side now or you know um my friend John injure record power line made a very good point he said you know the the the the uh the fact that Brett Kavanaugh\nA is you know so\nOften patiently a man of integrity\nOr an goodness what we're used to describe to you know a God fearing a a decent person yes\nThat fact was not an obstacle for the left it was actually a feature mhm why because it's it can destroy Brett Kavanaugh they can destroy\nAnyone right and they know that and so this is a a this is a warning\nTo other conservatives who who might be interested in are you going to join in a movement while they're conservatives who who take you know gosh maybe I could help the country in some way and I'd like to join the Trump Administration ... some other some other Republican administration\nI should say don't you dare because if you if you can do you understand we can destroy anyone and if you pose any kind of a threat\nUs we will destroy you just the way we've destroyed this guy and the the underlying message there of course is that a day that is to say or the the the the left progressive they believe that they are the\nOnly one a qualified to cover\nIt we might have a few conservatives for window dressing that we every now and then allowed into the party room but but really we're in charge because we have\nSome kind of a you know ... special insight into the way the world works in the white things off to go in America which is if they were trying to forge the trans national progressive\nA utopia that's or after and if you challenge that we will destroy\nThis what has happened you know what does happen now I think is active she\nKnow Republican after this no long fall below finally woken up you know I mean a\nMarvelous London it last week when when Lindsey Graham ah discovered a ... you know his backbone

on that and I want to pick up Roger on something you said I've been saying for years that\nTo the left foot we refuse to understand is the left\nThey simply don't think we are a legitimate movement here they simply don't think we have a right to touch rubber an empty barely okay for us to vote [noise]\nUm I Want to bring a long day for us a little bit yes well as we are now seeing what we do to

Want everyone to go read and I want to encourage you to check out his magazine the new criterion you want to be smart you want to listen to Roger and we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]

a by the activities of Robert Mueller and his pack of democratic activists prosecutors ... says crime\nBut we know now that it it had nothing to do with Russia his crime was having been elected that's road apples the crime that he was elected without permission and over the strenuous objections of um of people who felt that he was on it but you know what is that\nThey don't get to make that determination Cory Booker does\nNot get the state who gets to sit on the Supreme Court you know it just because you may not why someone it and this and if you if he's if he's one industry opened a democratic election that's\nJust too bad but see I think Roger and and we're going to be an fierce agreement here I Want to build on your point if I might\nUh I think we're the Democrats have all become so many Pauline Kael she you know the reference I I make yeah here in in in the in the sense that you write the crime was that Donald Trump got elected he goes to our point that that was not a legitimate election because not because of any Russian interference but really by virtue of the fact\nOf it than that he got elected and and for a a movement\nThat sees the Supreme Court as a super legislature or as a veto on propositions that our elected a into into law by the by the by the ... by the people or ain't into overturning state laws that that that state legislators engage in\nThis is ... as you rightly pointed out what they view the courts for it is it is it is not really a third part of government it's really the over arching\nA vouch safe they can go to to overturn the will of the people on almost any issue they disagree with the people on so why not disagree with the people on Donald Trump and slave this dreamer\nFor daring to participate in ... after all was a democratic process they have contempt for that's the whole basket\nThat it that you put your finger on it but I think it's a you know the the the the encouraging thing however is that people seem to be Nikita could this they woke up to it and uh in the fall of twenty sixteen and now they're there seems to be\nAnother rebel hands and you know I live in the ground I'm a either heard the tropics and many people are here and the Trump is I Can't tell you how many\nAre there new story actually in tweets and so on you know gosh you know I'm I'm a I'm a Democrat but it's just a this is beyond the pale which was an attack on on the rule of law on the idea of due process and you know I'm going to vote a Republican in the terms\nWell that's what I Hope that the lesson that's what I sure hope is the lesson and ... you know that I'd go ... you\nDon't know we don't know but I I Am the science I think are are pretty good I mean you know you you and and and that sort of bubble that you and I and habit or you know we of course we have our ears attuned to the the crazy people\nLike that professor at Georgetown University a Jesuit institution as you said that she hoped\nThat all the uh all of the um white male members of the\nJudiciary Committee will die miserable death and then be castrated and then talk to the swine to be eaten I mean it's the person who's actually teaching you know somebody's children that I Hope she's fired but it's you know\nThis is a peace with the with the with the with the with the statement that um who who made it over to NPR that they hoped Clarence Thomas would get cancer right this this is a peace with that [noise]\nBut yeah the book but I think I Want people to understand how how deeply our politics change which I took as the underlying point of your piece that American greatness it's a new era of politics and until we understand the ... ... fundamental point you and I are making we can't just make the usual arguments anymore we can't use the usual\nUh debating playbook anymore we can't assume people understand and agree with the innocence until uh until proven guilty we can't 'em any more rely on the idea of probable cause we have to understand truly\nThat they think we're illegitimate and it's going to require a whole new political playbook on our side\nThat's absolutely right that is the that is the take away by piece today and I'm I'm happy to say that that uh that Donald Trump if someone that you're going to make war on him\nHe will make war on you you know that it's time to a time to call up yeah call out and mustard the ... the soldiers because it these these people out of a no respect for the rule of law and the only way to to deal with that is I'm a direct confrontation not\nYet the agenda for for the moral\nAnd now I think that's right I think I think that you know they like us\nThey like us as Republicans and we'll switch say sweet things about us as conservatives even\nOnly really one we're no longer a threat or when we're dead look at all the ... to John McCain look at ... you weren't here but maybe you saw it on TV we had a funeral the first of them I Believe it was for John McCain here were Joe Biden spoke here in Phoenix\nAnd he talks about how he wants us to return to politics where we don't question each other's motives I said that day on radio\nGiven for days until his former Senate Judiciary committee post is a ... yeah is going to undertake the Kevin ... let's just see how far the Democrats believe what they're saying they likely and when he's gone to like Reagan when he was gone I cigarette or maybe in thirty fail safe if we had a real good looking like Donald Trump\nYes yes well of course it and then John McCain he Ronald Reagan the women were worthy deserving of of our ah crazy that mean in my view John McCain does not I mean I think he was a it poses a maverick or he he he was you know a disruptor dot map\nWill say this is the difference between Lindsey Graham and John McCain Lindsey Graham will sometimes stand up and make headlines defending us whereas the ... lakes in the John McCain's whenever they may net headlines and whenever they were you know credited
