take control back over your own power produced Sharon pay less for P. Y. O. P. produce your own power\nAnd pay less for it then if the power companies want to raise the rates once a week it's not going to affect you know working with me you're going to I'm going to design a system\nFor you not a cookie cutter system it is not about just solar panels on your roof anymore the power companies have made sure that your rape plans are so complicated it's not just about covering all of your power\nBecause at nighttime ... you need to buy some power from them at nighttime so there's a there's a lot more to this\nIs it is it's done incorrectly and I've heard lots of bad solar stories and that's where the bachelor stories come from if it's not done correctly with the right amount of electricity being produced on your roof\nWith the right weight plan and with demand management because many of these rape plans that you can only be on with solar if you do not manager demand that adjuster that's charging you very very highly\nA a a very ... much higher charge for your power between three and eight PM abs and s R P it's one of the ... ones is a one to eight and three to six\nIf you don't manage your demand you could end up having still a very high bill connected to the electric company so this is why I say to people I use the analogy there is lots of companies out\nThere that can make hamburgers there is only one that has the secret sauce I Am not trying to throw anybody under the bus I'm not trying to say anything bad about any other company I'm just saying make sure when you're going to consider P. Y. O. P.\nThat you're working with somebody who cares just like I cared about my daughter and my grandkids home to make sure it was done correctly\nBecause in my experience there's a lot of solar sales people out there and I'm not one of them I'm not a social person I'm a mom and a grandmother a retired nurse\nThat figured out that this was a very good solution for my own daughter and my own family\nAt reducing the cost of their power which they would continue to need for for for as long as they're in the house so basically they're going to be paying a power bill or power cost\nEvery month every year for decades to come\nAnd that's what we're all faced with so the only way to get away from what's going on with that's affecting our power companies pay the electric companies want to charge us more for the same power they sold us last year and now politics getting involved in it and there's these prop one twenty sevens and God only knows what else is coming down the pike\nIs produced your own\nPower and you're going to pay less for between seven and half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nThe average hopeful Jeremy if they just use the average amount of electricity over the next Twenty years with a very conservative number three percent increases over the next Twenty years he the as we've seen increases a far greater than twenty percent this year so I'm being very conservative when I say\nThese increases we don't know what they will be year after year after year and they keep sending out email or messages and advertisement\nYou know little jingles like oh be energy efficient whatever the only way to be energy efficient and be able to afford to live comfortably in your home is go out of the house during the daytime and go to the mall or go to the movie theater which is absolutely ridiculous you've worked so hard\nTo live comfortably in your home you for your family your retirement et cetera and these power companies that are dictating to us how much power we can use and how ... it is it are unaffordable unaffordable that is when we use it it's absolutely atrocious so\nThe way that you get you get ahead of this and you don't have to worry about this any more\nIs go to my website um Germany is going to give that out call me I'm again you pay ... we we can we can all collectively go down and rant and rave\nAt at group meetings and try and be heard in front of the Arizona corporation commission I just talked to somebody this week that he was on the ballot he didn't meet the primary he is a great guy great Christian man\nHow they don't want to get people on the Arizona ... I'm Sorry I'm I'm not saying that everybody ... corporation your mission but I'm telling you I've heard more of a good people that have not gotten on to the Arizona corporation mission because I think it's the old boys' network so again so you don't let these things affect your family your household budget [noise]\nGo to my Web site fill up the killer worksheet and keeps telling me how much power you used how badly how's your bill increased um in two thousand Eighteen from two thousand Seventeen and let's get you're producing your own power paying less for it and so these things won't ever affect your family in your household budget ever again\nYeah I heard uh some people talk about how easy it is and you're right you just go to the website\nAsks solar Sandy dot com that ask\nSolar Sandy dot com or you can call six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine one more time\nSix to three eight five zero eighty two twenty ninth and sometimes you'll your essay don't fall for the fake people these are why we get bad stories everybody who works with us we know they're going to have great outcomes so we want you to get the real deal that's where you go to ask\nSolar Sandy dot com ask solar Sandy dot com\nYou know it's so funny Jeremy I feel like I'm On a on a roll on on a tangent today but I so I'm so upset about um I at the I've been in homes this summer where people have kept a thermostat at eighty five eighty eight um the next increase or knew the taxes surcharge that they decided to add on somebody's bill\nWhat Ninety Ninety five degrees to the point where people's health and wellbeing are being compromised because of the greed of these power companies\nSo again you know five years ago in my daughter's neighborhood there was only maybe two homes that had solar on it now there is only two homes that don't\nSo it's really important everyone I Know that you probably at some point now are starting to look at oh my gosh are we going to be able to afford our power bills\nAnd he'll just sheer some of you haven't even seen the full impact of it your own budget building with a PS you could end up with the federal amount at the end of the year it could be five hundred it could be a thousand dollars\nThis is how deceptive these new rate plans are\nOn a PS recommended ... pounds for he said oh they're very similar to your old rate plan makes sure um if you're on by may first some people were migrated over be before may first but if you're on the budget billing you may not see the full extent of a PS is\nUm you know impact on your family is hopeful ... families and hopefuls budget because if you aren't paying the right amount on your budget billing you will have what's called the federal amount at the end of the year if you do not pay that several of them out your power will get shut off so at the end of the your\nChristmas or just after Christmas that in your last meal on December ... can you imagine getting a a a several amount for eight hundred thousand dollars Germany or could there be a worse time right and if you and you know if you don't pay that\nYour power gets ... and if you don't have it on time you get taken off budget Billy so by producing your own power ... and so there is a way for me to help my abs families eliminate owing anything to a pass\nYou're going to produce all the power you need for your home your day your nighttime and a little bit extra there was a deadline that I was talking about in previous weeks August thirty first it was the vibe that program anybody that worked with me and got in before August thirty first\nThey had to buy back of twelve point nine for any extra power that they didn't consumed during the day they were sending to a PS is good and they were buying it for twelve point nine\nA PS apparently four hundred and eighty eight million dollars isn't enough for them so they're now dropping that under review with the Arizona corporation commission you think they're going to get the approval of course they are down from twelve point nine to eleven points that it has not been an act and yet I cannot guarantee that\nUm even if today you got if I got your application and with a PS you're going to get the twelve point nine but dead end before they take the eleven point six cents away from us completely\nSo any extra power you're exporting back to the grid is a monetary credit on your bill not a kilowatt hour credit a monetary credit so those kilowatt credits are starting to produce a monetary credit on your bill\nCovers fees taxes in your nighttime power so at the end of the year I have many of my family is that are going to have checks back one thousand two thousand maybe even more back at the end of this year so again so you are locked into your own rate of between seven and a half and ... cents per kilowatt daytime nighttime that\nWill be you know you're you're you're on ... on the off peak power that you're producing on your roof will be range between seven and a half an eight cents per kilowatt\nIf you go to a passes website and are familiar with those those rate plans right now\nThere is no rape plan on a piece as well say or ... either that offers your power on peak or off peak at a guaranteed rate of seven and a half to eight and ... cents per kilowatt that lock she went for the next twenty five thirty years\nThat's the only way that you can lock in your own power prices by producing it yourself and not being subject to future\nAnd there's going to be more of them many more of them and things like prop one twenty seven is going to

P. produce your own power\nAnd pay less for it then if the power companies want to raise the rates once a week it's not going to affect you know working with me you're going to I'm going to design a system for you not a cookie cutter system it is not about just\nSolar panels on your roof anymore the power companies have made sure that your rate plans are so complicated it's not just about covering all of your power\nBecause at nighttime ... you need to buy some power from them at nighttime so there's a there's a lot more to this\nIs it is it's done incorrectly and I've heard lots of bad solar stories and that's where the bachelor stories come from if it's not done correctly with the right amount of electricity being produced on your\nRoof with the right weight plan and with demand management because many of these rape plans that you can only be on with solar if you do not manager demand that adjuster\nThat's charging you very very highly a a a very ... much higher charge for your power between three and eight PM a PS and s R P it's one of the ... ones is a one to eight and three to six\nIf you don't manage your demand you could end up having still a very high bill connected to the electric company so this is why I say to people I use the analogy\nThere is lots of companies out there that can make hamburgers there is only one that has the secret sauce I Am not trying to throw anybody under the bus I'm not trying to say anything bad about any other company I'm just saying make sure when you're going to consider P. Y. O. P.\nThat you're working with somebody who cares just like I cared about my daughter and my grandkids home to make sure it was done correctly\nBecause in my experience there's a lot of solar sales people out there and I'm not one of them I'm not a soldier sales person I'm a mom and grandma and retired nurse that figured out that this was a very good solution for my own daughter and my own family\nAt reducing the cost of their power which they would continue to need for for for as long as they're in the house so basically they're going to be paying a power bill or power cost\nEvery month every year for decades to come\nAnd that's what we're all faced with so the only way to get\nAway from what's going on with that's affecting our power companies pay the electric companies want to charge us more for the same power they sold us last year and now politics getting involved in it and there's these prop one twenty sevens and God only knows what else is coming down the pike is produced your own\nPower and you're going to pay less for between seven and half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nThe average house so Jeremy if they just use the average amount of electricity over the next Twenty years with a very conservative number three percent increases over the next Twenty years a pie as we've seen increases a far greater than twenty percent this year so I'm being very conservative when I say\nThese increases we don't know what they will be a year after year after year\nAnd they keep sending out email or messages and advertisement you know little jingles like oh be energy efficient whatever the only way to be energy efficient and be able to afford to live comfortably in your home is go out of the house\nDuring the daytime and go to the mall or go to the movie theater which is absolutely ridiculous you've worked so hard\nTo live comfortably in your home you for your family your retirement et cetera\nAnd these power companies that are dictating to us how much power we can use\nAnd how ... it is it are unaffordable ... unaffordable that is when we use it it's absolutely atrocious so the way that you get you get ahead of this and you don't have to worry about this any more\nIs go to my website um German is going to give that out call me I'm again you pay ... we we can we can all collectively go down and rant and rave\nAt a group meetings and try and be heard in front of the Arizona corporation mission I just talked to somebody this week that he was on the ballot he didn't meet the primary he is a great guy great Christian man\nHow they don't want the people on the Arizona ... I'm Sorry I'm I'm not saying that everybody ... Arizona corporation your mission but I'm telling you I've heard more of a good people that have not gotten on to the Arizona corporation commission because I think it's the old boys' network so again so you don't let these things affect your family your hustles budget\nGo to my Web site fill out the killer worksheet and keeps telling me how much power you used how badly how's your bill increased um in two thousand Eighteen from two thousand Seventeen and let's get you're producing your own power paying less for it and so these things won't ever affect your family in your household budget ever again\nYeah I heard uh some people talk about how easy it is and you're right you just go to the website asks solar Sandy dot com fat ask solar Sandy dot com or you can call six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine one more time six to three eight five zero\nEighty two twenty ninth and sometimes you'll hear a say don't fall for the fake people these are why we get bad stories everybody who works with us we know they're going to have great outcomes so we want you to get the real deal that's where you go to ask\nSolar Sandy dot com ask solar Sandy dot com\nYou know it's so funny Jeremy I feel like I'm On a on a roll on on tangents day but I so I'm so upset about um I at the I've been in homes this summer where people have kept a thermostat at eighty five eighty eight um the next increase or new fee taxes surcharge that they decided to add on somebody's bill\nWhat Ninety Ninety five degrees to the point where people's health\nAnd wellbeing are being compromised because of the greed of these power companies\nSo again you know five years ago in my daughter's neighborhood there was only maybe two homes that had solar on it now there is only two homes that don't so it's really imports and everyone\nI Know that you probably at some point now are starting to look at oh my gosh are we going to be able to afford our power bills\nAnd he'll just sheer some of you haven't even seen the full impact of it your own budget building with a PS you could end up with a subtle amount at the end of the year it can be five hundred it could be a thousand dollars this is how deceptive these new rate plans are\nOn a PS recommended rape plans for he said oh they're very similar to your old rate plan makes sure um if you're on a by may first some people were migrated over be before may first but you're on the budget billing you may not see the full extent of abs is\nUm you know impact on your family is hopeful ah families and hopefuls budget\nBecause if you aren't paying the right amount on your budget billing you will have what's called a settled amount at the end of the year if you do not pay that several of them out your power will get shut off so at the end of the year Christmas or just after Christmas\nDidn't your lessons on December ... can you imagine getting a a a several amount for eight hundred thousand dollars Germany or could there be a worse time right\nAnd if you and you know if you don't pay that\nYour power gets ... and if you don't have it on time you get taken off budget building so by producing your own power ... so there is\nA way for me to help my ape his family's eliminate owing anything to a pass you're going to produce all the power you need for your home your day your nighttime and a little bit extra\nThere was a deadline that I was talking about in previous weeks August thirty first it was the buyback program anybody that worked with me and got in before August thirty first\nThey had to buy back of twelve point nine for any extra power that they didn't consumed during the day they were sending to a PS is good and they were buying it for twelve point nine\nA PS apparently four hundred and eighty eight million dollars isn't enough for them so they're now dropping that under review with Arizona corporation commission you think they're going to get the approval of course they are down from twelve point nine to eleven points that it has not been enacted yet I cannot guarantee that\nUm even if today you got if I got your application and with a PS you're going to get the whole point nine but yet in before they take the eleven point six cents away from us completely\nSo any extra power you're exporting back to the grid its monetary credit on your bill not a kilowatt hour credit a monetary credit so those killer credits are starting to produce a monetary credit on your bill\nCovers fees taxes in your nighttime power so at the end of the year I have many of my families that are going to have checks back one thousand two thousand maybe even more back at the end of this year so again\nSo you are locked into your own rate of between seven and half and ... cents per kilowatt daytime nighttime that will be you know you're you're you're on ... on the off peak power that you're producing on your roof will be range between seven and half and half cents per kilowatt\nIf you go to a PS his website and are familiar with those those refunds right now there is no rape plan on a piece as well say or ... either that offers your power on peak or off peak at a guaranteed rate of seven and a half to eight and a half cents per kilowatt that locks you win for the next twenty five thirty years\nThat's the only way that you can lock in your own power prices by producing it yourself and not being subject to\nFuture and there's going to be more of them many more of them and things like prop one twenty seven is going to impact or cough a PS\nAs opposed to this the reason they're opposed to this they're up already pencil into their um their their operating costs fifty nine hundred megawatts of natural gas plant\nTime Sean gave an accuracy shooting this competitive competition has simply

between slandering on those powerful sunscreens in spending more time indoors and what it really comes down to is this vitamin D deficiency that's out there is causing an avalanche of health problems for Seventy percent of our population ranging from\nPain loss of balance muscle weakness depression increase blood pressure arthritis memory loss and even a compromised immune system and I have Dr Michael Pincus with me today to talk about the most effective way to get to Monday Dr pay guess it's good to talk to you again\nMax thank you\nYou know many of you know that Dr biggest is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's a successful chiropractor he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some of today's top health concerns and\nLet's start at the top Dr ... talk a little bit about what are some of the warning signs that you may be deficient in vitamin D\nOkay well the part of it is how you feel and one of the things Chris is being tired for no apparent reason okay\nBut on the river side of that I've seen a lack of vitamin D effect fiercely\nOkay another big China's at your bones ache now there's a lot of people listening who have been diagnosed with add your process which is the thing of the ball ...\nBut again a vitamin D deficiency boy is muscle weakness so you try to get on the couch you get out of a car and you're finding it more and more difficult and leading to the high high prevalence of people falling and injuring themselves\nOh okay All right here which is a huge problem right exactly and\nThe other one is you tend to get more calls especially upper respiratory problems okay problems with blood\nPressure cardiovascular problems digestive problems consultation bloating gas ... it's very very common and if you're a diabetic there's all kinds of data about being the fission vitamin D and the list goes on and on it's a huge problem\nWhat does vitamin D actually do in the body what does it use for\nWell when we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D is actually a hormone okay\nAnd that regulates thousands of genes in the body everything from pain blood sugar immune system blood pressure phone string plus ... has been linked to maintaining all and health\nBreast and ovarian health but I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all wrong it all messed up\nWell why do you say that why is it messed up\nWell first of all the documents which are vitamin D supplements and it's like four hundred international unit which is totally worthless\nOr God Forbid if you're listening right now and you're taking a multi vitamin and you'd think you're Harvard fats while you're on six or eight or ten different prescription drugs I'll tell you that right now ...\nBecause your body is not getting enough the the other thing is that vitamin D is an oil he don't absorb oils and your body they're very difficult to digest okay I've come up with my own vitamin D which I call Dr focus the vitamin D three formula\nSo Dr bank is what makes your fast smelled vitamin D formula so unique\nOh Chris first of all I put five thousand units of vitamin D three per serving in each tablet actually she all the different I wanted to give you enough dosage so it really goes to work second I use the right type of vitamin D and my formula\nWhich is superior and readily available for your body can digest it and this is known as vitamin D three and my\nFormula is a fast tablet that's available for immediate absorption [noise]\nYou know you mentioned that vitamin D is an oil so how were you able to make your formula into a fast melt\nWell good question Chris here's what I've done\nI've worked with an advantage team of scientists and these guys they know their stuff and they're using this technology to convert vitamin D which is an oil into a dry powder and once they do that they put in a combat dissolving Mel for immediate action and quick resolve that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr bank is from people that are taking your fast smell the three\nOh I'm getting feedback you know I've got people that email me here's an email from Patty and she writes I was diagnosed with a severe vitamin D deficiency and she says she tried many other vitamin supplements\nOkay and then she discovered might be three and she said she went back to the doctor had a blood test and her blood tests on back into a normal range just within weeks\nWow All right folks don't want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Pincus says vitamin D three formula there's a special toll free number for you to call\nIt's one eight hundred for six seven
