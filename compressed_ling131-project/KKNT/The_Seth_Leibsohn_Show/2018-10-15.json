get top dollar we're going to get very very important right no question about Josh [noise] um and then for you\nYou sir we'll our topic always great topics home affordability we're going to be talking about just surf mortgage fraud dive into that a little bit of\nRent prices falling is that really true I Will say man we're going to get into that also Glendale up the door deal baby back door Neal you've done some Glendale sales\nI have ... a matter of fact on one of our coming soon properties is on Glendale on an acre I'm Talking about that we had a guy Peter buying them do I think we did the guy was great forget him now he's cool\nAh but first why don't we start with mark it up with ... first financial\nYes sir Yes sir so we started our market up there with some rate information\nAh remember last Wednesday is a topic let's forget it so last Wednesday we had quite a big increase in rates\nGood news is we've ... we've rebounded we've gained a quite a bit of the hike that we had since last Wednesday ... um yeah so it's coming back around um but just to kind of recap it's extremely volatile up and down up and down\nUm something some examples um some things that are you know plain or into the different ah rates and the stocks fell off\nWe have China or ... something to do with their currency that's kinda affecting rates and and sell off um their their China's weaponization of their foreign assets is another thing I'm the fed shift\nAnd the some of the hurricane to those are all things are kind of playing in the ... a factor in what's going on with our rates ... um so you know given the rates of increased we we are seeing a little bit of a drop in mortgage applications I'm not as big as I thought um sore down one point seven percent seasonally\nFrom from last year you know given the rates are up and it's kind of you know sometimes things ... around the holidays and get a little bit slower buzz true I'm not not a huge drop off um\nEven though rates are going up and um you know applications are down\nThe sentiment that uh there's a survey that they you know take a poll on is it a good time to buy ... so we had a we had seen that drop off two months in a row ... ... and September we seen that came back so you know despite the rates and you know despite affordability most people still think it's a great time\nBut there's nothing crazy leaning either way whether it's selling or buying and like I said for the last ... years it's it's a very healthy healthy buyer and seller market in my opinion it's it's not it doesn't lean heavily either way I don't think I mean are you seeing anything different\nNo I mean to you 'cause it's a little harder I think for someone to get under contract because there's there's a lot of competition especially in that three hundred thousand and below right a hundred percent um but I think um you're seen you know\nPeople understanding that hey you know it's not going to get much better no I I I had a guy who are real life example he he that under contract three times\nAnd every time he's found a reason to drop out you know [laughter] interesting mostly in the home inspection right you know our senators and what he's really what he's really trying to do is put the screws to the seller uh-huh and they're not having it I\nSee your hand and he's thinking that you know it's going to get better you know I'm rates are going to get better the market's going to change things like that well he found a home that he just absolutely loves and I think he finally realized hey it's time to\nTo make it happen right right I'm sure his realtor was really loving that finding home after home after home for him to cancel during the inspection you know\nHonestly it's on ... it's not a agent that I work with a lot yeah maybe once or twice a year ha ha but God Bless her [laughter] he's still just patient she'll wow now he did he didn't sell their home\nSo he sold their home and they're in there and at least back this how long it's been they took at least back after the sale because he's been shopping so much right\nI'm wrap this up a little bit so the ... uh this is interesting Social Security is giving a to point eight percent cost of living increase in two thousand Nineteen ... so that's not that I'm\nHave a couple of little ... a quick ... wrap this up\nUm life expectancy of at least Seventy years that's kinda what the the national you know us averages there\nThat's up about twenty five years from about a hundred years ago [laughter]\nUm there's a ... the top the top of goes to Hong Kong followed pie Singapore or Spain and Italy they their average lifespan is four point two years longer than us ... I Wonder why that is just what do you think\nYou have any ... uh Singapore blows my mind that ice in why maybe I don't know Hong Kong could see Spain and Italy and possibly but Singapore I I don't know interesting um [noise] yeah\nOne less thing here September ... a growth of jobs or a hundred and thirty four thousand new jobs man I'm and just to wrap up the market up there a lot of those jobs are in Arizona I scrap that article I was going to talk about because I talked about it a couple of weeks ago but there's a ton of jobs coming Arizona man\nI remember you talking about it in it and it I think just the companies you talked about it acquainted to like eight or nine or ten thousand jobs in Arizona is\nEven more now wow there's there's been some of the added since the last time I talked about it was crazy it's crazy\nThat's exciting a lot of growth and we are the sixth largest city in the nation so a lot of people think Arizona Phoenix you know it's just it's all desert no it's not\nYou know what even living here that that I almost don't want to believe that yet I mean I Know it's crazy I Know like when I go to Houston summer five yeah we're right behind them when I go there and visit my wife's family I think and this place of huge but then I think God it's barely bigger than where I live\n[laughter] nice 'cause we're so spread out\nWe are I mean to go from literally gold canyon to the north west valley way I'm surprised I mean it's an hour and a half sometimes longer Dr\nDue to go from you know single came into the stadium hike it's it's a hike or it's about an hour and a half oh wow and that's not even the end of the valley yeah you go out to Buckeye even further yeah oh\nGeez it let's talk about some coming soon properties a lot of our listeners and viewers of the real estate power\nThey learn to listen to she'll because they want to get their foot in the door on coming soon properties we had before they hit the MLS and fifty thousand other realtors can see 'em a so here's what we got we got one out in Glendale and this is it thirty eight twenty to Moro drive\nTwenty four hundred plus square feet three bedroom two and a half bath\nOne acre irrigated home site\nCompletely remodeled in two thousand twelve listeners Josh new rough and AC in two thousand sixteen no ACOA oh wow that's great it's got attack house in the back of chicken coop and the back in those places manicure and see a acreage either an acre of salt shaker nice irrigated lot out in Glendale\nFor just shy of four hundred thousand an acre yes as square footage from the home a little over twenty four hundred lots single level that's great single level and it'll show they\nKnow about the taxes are decent now\nOr I Would say so but the area is a fantastic location and they're moving because they bought another house from us sitting on two acres to where they can you know store some of their they own a a plumbing company so they want to where it all the roads roughly\nA I'm driving out to at today trucker saw hit that once but I'll update every one next week condos are growing area man yeah it's like thirty eighth of a union hills area Oh nice yeah\nSo a growing area but that one there just shy of four hundred thousand if you want to know more give us a call sick so two three six nine forty six sixty three ... results realty what a great opportunity to get in on something\nYou know how we sell twenty to thirty percent before they hit the MLS because of the radio show in the coming soon campaign that we do results real teach in the choir buddy you know I hear yeah\nHey we have another one at a this is something Gilbert the bridges et Gilbert which is Higley in queen creek area\nYou know that every well I Do [laughter]\nI Do it's a ... home single level thirty three hundred square feet three car garage this was built three years ago for better and plus the game room pool natural turf and a and this has created an absolutely\nBeautiful it's high end trim works out I mean wanes coating on the walls a high end ... tree and the bedrooms um the laundry room and this one's going to be just shy of six hundred thousand I'm signing your lesson two hundred bucks a flood\nSo they went up they went up last week and they write down a little bit this week this week\nSo have you seen a lot of people get off the fence and like you know what I Need to walk and now I Need to make a decision now we're only seeing\nNot really I mean I'm you know I I don't I don't think people most Neal people's ... watches as closely as David ... okay um I think people in general and you can speak to this I think the just the overall outlook on people looking at race I think it sucks\nYou know there were very spoiled over the last\nShoot maybe four years mhm where we were dealing with ultra ultra low rates you know what I mean um I went I went back a couple weeks ago to look at some of the clients that I've helped or in the last two or three years ... to look and see if there's any 'cause a lot of people like to re fight through the holidays for you know cash out things like that\nAnd some of the rates man they're just crazy loaded men threes things like that three three and a quarter you know I I saw I saw two point something on a Fifteen to plant some five um it's just crazy yeah so I think that\nPeople don't realize how much worse it could really be yeah you know what I mean\nBut even then even with the rates where they're at right now historically although there are historically low levels so [noise] you know it's a you know I don't want people to know freaking out over and everything because it's not that way I'm not sure if she's so\nGood I think like I hear a lot of that though what about you I think people are like oh it's just it's richer too crazy\nI don't hear a lot of that oh okay I I just don't you I'm sure you're in the business do you hear it every day\nHere's wouldn't wanna live ... I hear about ... home prices here's what you hear the other end or the other right that's right so I'm dealing with this is my articles correct there's two things working against us I I got to deal with the the rates and you've got to do on the other end I got I got to pay twenty thousand for extra for that house [laughter]\nYeah well then then I have 'em call one of my friends from the bay area for that same home all at one point seven million [laughter]\nOne of my co workers set up as a last week and she said uh regardless of race or any other surprises people are always going to buy homes\nThat is true you know that's true and here's the thing if people aren't buying homes what are they doing they're renting renting\nNow what do you have there in front of you in regards to ranch because I can I can tell you this while you're pulling up a little bit of a report their head um rental rates in Arizona are high as a matter of fact\nIn almost every case let's say you find a home that you're looking at renting oh yeah you look at what you're paying for rent on that place and if you ended up buying it\nYour payment would be lower in almost all cases and it would be if you're renting the home and on top of that you have the pride of homeownership you can paint the house whatever color you want you to put a ball and if you want you can do whatever you want right of the home right\nI totally tax write offs I totally agree with you I mean I have a home alone closing on the twenty six\nI'm their rent is almost twenty two hundred a month yep their mortgage payments Nineteen thirty well they have it right and you on the home you know this is interesting what the pick this backup after the we have about a minute yeah or less and then I asked to speak to your uh she

[laughter] you know a lot of interest enough for the love it if they fail interrupt her face\nIn the last segment we're talking about the effect of rental rates so\nYeah it's kind of a joke but um we were talking about in Arizona especially and I gave a real life example of your mortgage payment right now ... less than your rent mhm and a lot of times and we didn't talk about this you can get into those homes um for next to nothing\nUh in fact that the customer the customer I was talking about is doing a grant program where they're getting their whole five percent down payment given to them while now\nAnd then you can have the seller cover closing the ...\nThe seller give Seventy five hundred dollars on that one a mother of all their ... walking into it for an inspection\nGhastly but they could this year alone we closed none of them six seven or eight something like that Holmes least at least\nAt least so here here's a kind of time back into the rent so like I said it was kind of a joke in September the national average again this is a national this not Arizona on how to find some numbers in Arizona if we change or not but a national average we drop by a dollar okay [laughter]\nFor first time in eight months but\nSince last year we've seen those three to five percent increase\nAcross the board nationally from throughout ... thousand Seventeen and truly we're we're up three to five percent believe we lost a dollar ... so I'm so to speak to your point and it's kind of you know spring or this topic to close\nIt is um you know definitely beneficial reach out to you reach out to me six to three southern southern Nineteen Seventy nine find out your options um before you throw in other I mean you you can know this isn't it a first and last month's rent and sometimes a deposit\nYeah it could be ... father and right yeah oh easily money out of pocket but she got to remember is that if you don't keep that plays darn near perfect I mean minus normal wear and tear but where's the line on normal wear and tear that's the thing some landlords or like\nMake sure all the bulbs work you guys there's nothing worse than walking into a home to where you know you have the the camel lights in the kitchen you pop those babies on an half of them are burned out it\nJust makes it seem like you haven't cared for the home so make sure all\nThe lights work I'm Josh I'm gonna ask you a question absolutely what feature on the front of a home um comprises of probably thirty to forty percent when you look at home [noise]\nThirty or forty percent of the elevation the ... look at the home what one feature\nComprise the thirty forty percent would you say I'm gonna get the door you know the front door or the garage door garage door yes absolutely good guess because I mean takes up so much the space and how many garage doors have you seen that have dance um they have a\n... you know if there are an older home and there would garage door in their flaking\nAnd the\nMen to on the on the flip side of that I've seen some really cool new uh paint and kind of I don't know if it's like texture of the making these garage doors look kind of old fashioned ... with us\nGlue carriage little glass pain through it yeah that was in a in the end the carriage hinges on it yeah yeah yeah ... yes when I'm getting at is the garage door you guys for a thousand or two if you can replace it refinish it add those carriage hinges if you reach away will approve it things like that\nReally amp up the first impression of a home so somebody to his weren't allowed to know someone if the big changes or at least get it approved through the architectural committee for 'em but it's got to go with the outside look of the home obviously but there's so many things you could do that to be outside of your home\nUm and then that's a great point yes and then I talk about it all the time just the little fixes and I call it preventative maintenance um you know if you have little touch trim switches on the inside of the home that cost twenty five cents each in their cracked in the house by new ones replace some a loose door handles right dirty\nUm sliding glass door ... tracks\nClean those things out little silicone sprays sugar sliding glass door opens and closes easy it's the little things that make that first impression Yes sir what do you think Josh\nDo I think it's a no brainer I mean like we talked about it are there any any business transaction or situation\nFirst impressions are key um I mean the garage door you know to just like you said that you're going to pull up right in front of it that is really going to be one of the first things that they assess yeah you know really is and then you know like you talked about the landscape I mean God who wants to go in a house that has a unappealing landscape\nNobody that's the landscaping front and back is is a major major part of a just the overall first impression look of the property so make sure that looks good unless we have a clean or go through clean the place inside the cabinets windows all of that makes a difference you know you don't want dusty ... windows\nRemove those sunscreens brighten the home up those are just a few tips for me Jason well fleshed out results real to give me a call anytime if you have any question about that stuff six to three six nine forty six sixty three it doesn't cost for me to answer questions and ah I just hope that I can better situation call me any time\nYou know the we talked about the outside now you talked about the inside a little bit some switches things like that what do you think it was like the when you walk into someone is kitchen right ... ... would you say is the biggest uh first impression there\n[noise] [noise]\n'cause that's an important part of the home you know well I can just tell you speak from experience on homes where they have the uh well granite countertops ... some of the obvious stuff if you have the older I get like the OLC cabinets ... to get them re finished or re painted\nIts ah we got guys at fifty dollars or a drawer or not a drawer but a door so you just count up all the doors in your kitchen times fifty bucks\nAnd that's what it costs all the doors are included by the way so those are free gotcha but that's to refinish um restrain them completely so I mean you can get a kitchen done for about a thousand bucks an hour ago\nAnd it totally updates the kitchen put some handles and some drawer polls on there and it next thing you know you go from Nineteen Seventy two thousand Eighteen boom you really do so chemistry chemistry backslash so few hundred bucks to do a nice backslash\nYou take care of that there's this to you know the kitchen it said it's five or six things that you could do that don't cost that much when you when you re face to repaint can if you don't have to change them all out and spend Fifteen twenty grand right you know contrary to what a what the pike yeah because a cat and it's\nA lot of those cabinets are expensive and they're probably still good just they need a little ah a cause medical update on the outside\nAs a matter of fact cabinets from Nineteen eighty ... earlier are built far better than cabinets are what do I want us there just no better there's solid cost cutting huh solid chemistry man there go ah let's move on mortgage fraud is any of that going on right now so you know surprisingly\nEnough um this is a big number for me mortgage fraud risk jumped more than twelve percent year over year\nPretty ... is that is this on line stuff for what what is it a mortgage fraud so what what is ... well no explain to me well\nSelling of different kinds of 'em are what do I mean oh geez I mean I've heard of\nProbably don't have time the gamut [laughter] I mean\nA lot of a lot of the biggest mortgage fraud in all talked about that in hearing al ... al tied into why it's getting a why it's increasing is ah fabricating or or um changed documentation a hook 'em ... generally uh it it ... around people's income ...\nSomeone or providing a pay stubs that over exaggerate their income someone providing a W to\nThat over exaggerates their income\nUm believe it or not in this will blow your mind\nUp until two thousand ten\nThere was a very very little verification of documentation income mhm um I mean obviously 'cause we had such you know stated income and said well not even that I mean for example um there's a forum called the forty five or six tea which is a form that tells\nThe client hey we're going to go and verify your W. twos or tax returns through the government to the IRS\nWell up until two thousand ten all you'd ever did was get it signed you never executed for and that was across the board huh so someone could give you a W to that said you made Ninety grant and there was not going to be any verification of that you\nKnow ultimately if people are are [noise] like what you're talking about pay stubs and all that if they're if they're up in those things mhm isn't that ultimately hurting themselves because they can't afford the home that they are in really so\nTo answer your question that's why it's happening you you said why is it up\nUm we talked about earlier there's two things that are happening in our market we've got the rates going up and we've got home prices that are increasing so it's making homes what more harder to lower the fertile right right it's making it harder to afford\nSo they are the article that I got here from CNBC says that's why I'm you're seeing ... such an increase in a mortgage fraud is because people are having to afford these homes\nYou know and having to you know make their income more than\nIt it really has to just to be able to afford a home builder for the ... absolutely stretch it out that's why we've seen that the twelve percent rise while I'm\nYeah it's crazy and like I said I'm ... it\nPuts the people know in a in a bad situation but it also puts though the lender I'm In a rough spot\nI'm you know and also ... it could you know that that could hurt the seller of the home it can hurt the ... who wants to deal in the middle of the die over some type of\nFraudulent documents yeah no one other one puts everyone else it does a dust interesting yeah so that that that's why I mean you ask why it's because uh you know

McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional and Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThey are it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress it's such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress\nOn the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects their body sure so the waste stress affects the body as this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose as a stress into tension and\nYour muscles and contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right\nAt the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel that has the most of the arteries that go up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient and calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I still frozen and fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many cats can supplement or how many ... at issue it\nHas to do with simple absorption calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does do here but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys you and your body shutdown actually dies\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and either two sources of calcium one isn't it diet you know and to us from the bones than south\n... orbit back from the bones if neither that's right but I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... yeah\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian irradiated um the calcium as lead from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food storage right right right but these things don't absorb and the body\nThat's up for a couple of reasons one when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in it like a dumb first of all calcium absorb in body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom\nAntacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd differences is that a powdered\nAnd what happens is they put it in hot water and you mix it up and drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that's a problem that\nWell yeah because when Cal the many of them are in a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says offense to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing them take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medication sleeping pills but the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all this thing\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people are ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe a thirty minute to counteract the pain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time an error I mean this is really amazing\nGiven us thank you uh what are the Boston Globe is now had to do this is wonderful the Boston Globe is now had to do to corrections on the Elizabeth Warren story when they were touting touting or her DNA results or they just can't help but get it right and by the way CBS has some cleaning up to do to\nThey can't get right Mr Moonves Moonves is Les Moonves has [noise] a\nDismissal in resignation on there's a story on the wall Street Journal a drama CBS cannot cancelled and wondering it's boardroom\nA boardroom are going crazy over how to deal with Les Moonves and um but I didn't know this someone I used to know a little bit um was William Cohen is Clinton secretary of defense and a former senator from Maine I always thought a fairly feckless man a not a great\nSecretary of defense or for that matter or distinguished senator never said anything too smart but it looks like he resigned from the board I didn't know where he was on it\nBecause of the portrayal of him being such a staunch supporter of Mr Moonves these people um what right do they have to lecture us about morals and ethics really what right do they have it all\nA here here's a question I've always wondered and I can't get a good answer to by the way I noticed that um there's another interesting economics\nStory going on that uh\nThat uh Florida orange juice is going to have orange juice citrus from Florida is is going to have a hard time due to uh do do do do a bunch of 'em a bunch of different events or some having to do with whether some having to do with a rod um and a disease that I guess has hit the oranges\nWhat dawned on me it was interesting does anyone know why the spokesman for the for the orange juice growers association or whatever they're called always tend to be conservative\nThey had a big foot slapped with a very right wing um personality or in the seventies Anita Bryant and\nUh they they ultimately had to get rid of her but others spokesmen and have included a famous radio announcer that you you whose name you may know speaking of nicknames I'm Tom Selleck was a spokesman for the Florida and orange juice growers association what is orange juice a conservative drink\nShould it be should we make orange juice I mean our our or drink of record here maybe we should\nMaybe we should um other interesting thing having to do with race and we're talking about the lawsuit against Harvard and how hard it's going to be a a how hard it's been on\nAsian Americans because they're the wrong graceful group of them are suing good I Hope they win and I hope we get rid of race a in every aspect of education as well as hiring practices and everywhere else I'm just so tired of it so tired\nOf the racial Issam in this country I Do not think we'll ever get beyond race so long as we never get beyond race\nBut the other thing that's going on right now I don't know if you've picked up on it as a series of articles essays it's a theme that may have started really\nIn a way with Hillary Clinton uh in her condemnations of the electoral college\nBut now it's kind of affecting arguments about the U.S Senate and you're seeing columns there's one in the New York times uh today about how the U.S Senate is basically affirmative action for white people\nBecause of the ah representation in the United states ... United States Senate a journal Goldberg is taking it on a saying that blacks Asians and Hispanics disproportionately live in big states and big states allegedly have less representation in the Senate and small small states\nI say allegedly because the truth is that all states have the same representation in the Senate because the Senate is supposed to represent states that was the whole point of the Connecticut Compromise that was essential to the ratification of the constitution\nI understand that the seventeenth amendment made senators directly elected by the state's voters but in our system states are supposed to have corporate interests that deserve representation in our Republican order imagine if the U.N General assembly have proportional representation\nChina would have had more than four votes for every one of America's and one hundred and Twenty one for every one of Belgium Z and one thousand and Thirteen for every one of Trinidad states aren't countries of course ... but they ain't nothing either if you think states should have some saying the government as states you're going to have to forego\nSome kind of purity\nUm yeah this is ah this this this is we're talking about if it makes you said the California doesn't have more clout and the Senate fine but playing statistical games based on race and ethnicity is a pernicious way\nOf approaching the problem because Americans live where they live for a host of complex reasons is Jonah rights as having a greater say in the Senate were remotely as important as the majority or even caucus wants it to be people would move in order to maximize their voting power they don't because that's not how people think\nThank God more important\nBending the system to the idea that the government in Washington should see the country as a bunch of competing racial and ethnic groups with no particular or meaningful attachment to place and community\nWhose only relationship to government is on mediated through state and local government is precisely the sort of thinking that so many people have lamented about the dissed uniting of America also to\nThe underlying big gorilla in this room is the whole notion that people think or their ideology is shaped by their race I thought we had been done with that at the end of World War two or perhaps at Nuremberg\nBut no I'm Don Lemon and the crowd is CNN obviously still thinks\nThat to be of a certain race has to dominate the kind of thinking and ... you affiliated with I have longer poured that\nAs I longer pour any notion that race matters at all we had a pretty delicate and substantive conversation about this on Thursday and friday of last week and I thought it was some of the best conversations we've done\nOn main issues in America the kinds of issues that a lot of people are afraid to talk about because I like to say they really should be no closed questions in an open society and what CNN\nDid with Kanye West I thought was despicable
