covered on\nOkay where am I go in ... I'm going to Nick and Phoenix Nick welcome back\nFirst show\nI think you know\nThe day when she was\nDescribing her\nNeck I Would do a ... just so you know in my first hour I always open up with a monologue and I did for the first time in my I think broadcasting career I uh I had a replacement monologue and it was her\nA it was Susan Collins is a concluding statements ah from the center for today I I definitely\nUh am and I'm I I just I was blown away by\n... yeah well it was just it seemed like a scary that you see the one that would be like the icing on the cake but I Would play out and and then just change some of that response is from the opposition on Twitter was just pretty amazing and that\nThey were holding out for it and now she's\nTrying to work at which the west coast because she is reasonable and she makes sense and she ... the law and she said you know what the purpose of the first place [laughter]\nWell yeah I mean Nick ah she she I think spoke for a lot of um people in a similar situation to which she uh for better or for worse may represent which is this you know this mythical but concrete\nA mythical to the political uh the political consultant class but concrete and the real world to the suburban for lack of a better way\nTo say at the suburban white woman I think Susan Collins spoke to that and she spoke to the common sense of it\nAnd I think the consultants ... lot of times rub their hands and worry about you know how certain things Republicans do or say or stand for are going to negatively affect the voted the suburban woman or the suburban white woman I think they've been wrong more often in the right I think they over worry I think the like strong leadership I think they like common sense\nI don't think they are divided from most Americans who believe in common sense who believe in the security and want security for their families who want economic opportunity not only for their children but for themselves and for their spouses I think what they want is what most of us want and I think what we saw here from someone like Susan Collins is the same kind of thing we saw\nJust a little over a week ago from Lindsey Graham's two very moderate Republicans who have just had enough of the nonsense they couldn't take it anymore to hear from Susan Collins means ... because it was not only strong and articulate [noise]\nThis is not a Republican of um of great measure her American conservative union rating is forty five percent that means she votes more liberal even conservative like\nThis this this was an important statement of hers I Want everyone to read it if they haven't um I watched it and they can get an offer website it was a hugely important statement [noise]\n[noise] [noise] she was asked it upset by\nThe way you can\nSee this is the rap yeah this is the point I think I think the Democrats played this hand totally wrong way I think that the blowback on this and one of the lessons of this as people got to see\nWhat the left has become and what they will do it's not just the politics of personal destruction which is terrible and bad enough\nBut I think they have made personal destruction of politics this is the left this is what you vote for and get excuse me this is what you get when you vote for Democrats and I think that's the memory that will go forward in November I really do\nAll thank you appreciate it\nThank you Nick I mean that's why I think what Lindsey Graham said was so important when he said God y'all want power I Hope you never get it\nOr we should probably make a sound bite of that but this is what happens when they don't have power imagine what happens when they do a Susan don't go away I'm going to come to you on the other side of this break but we can work Richard in first Richard is in Phoenix Hi Richard\nHello very very quick thing as a lawyer or and and your you went to law school as well as I recall um some struck me that I don't understand why people didn't bring this up immediately immediately when people were charging Mr Kavanaugh with things that happen thirty five years ago [noise]\nThe people of the United states all fifty states the district of Columbia the federal jurisdiction Puerto Rico all people through their elected representatives\nMhm may be cleared statute of limitations and\nStatues of clothes which say if\nYou don't bring a claim within a certain amount of time we're not going to spend resources on it\nAnd and it's all there is to it you don't have to go past that the other thing is the other for all three jurisdiction than probably all the rest of them as well\nThat and juveniles are are are you know formerly protected against having their juvenile records used against them you could practically kill somebody at age sixteen and nobody would know about it when you're Twenty one\n[noise] Richard I'm you're giving voice to a powerful sentiment and it's something that Susan Collins talked about a little bit as well when her in her comments today she talked about you know vote we aren't in a legal atmosphere here we're not in a court of law were not looking at specific legal standards\nAre those standards exist for a purpose and they do provide us some guidance I'm One of the things that you know it's interesting to me Richard is that Susan Collins actually said\nGave us corroborating witnesses both in her letter to Dianne Feinstein\nIn her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee and in her interview with the media in our interviews with the Washington Post she has given us witnesses the problem is and as we have all said and as a Susan Collins put it in her speech today\nNone of those witnesses bear out any of what Dr Ford has claimed why with Dr forgive us those witnesses if none of them if none of them can validate what she said\nObviously Dr Ford provided those witnesses for two reasons one is to help establish what took place\nUm and to show us that she has a memory of this or some kind of memory of this\nBut also very clearly for the purposes that those witnesses should be inquired of should be asked of what happened now all of them to a T including her longtime friend miss Kaiser all of them bread teeth\nTo repeat for the as you know well I'm I'm tense times denying knowing any thing about this but let me say something else I'm Susan that\nSenator Collins said in her speech today I'm just going to quote from her speech today um she said furthermore the professor Dr four testified that all those although she does not remember how she got home that evening she knew that because of the distance you would've needed a ride yet not a single person has come forward\nTo say that they were the one that drove her home over in the car with her that night\nAnd professor Ford also indicated that even though she left that small gathering of six or so people abruptly and without saying goodbye and distraught\nNone of them called her the next day or ever to ask why she left not even her closest friend them as Kaiser nor has anyone else called or identified themselves as having knowledge of this party or being at this party\nSo the memory issue can almost be taken off the table it is not a he said she said that so many want to portray it it is a she said\nOn one side she being Dr Ford and if he said in it being I'm Brett Kavanaugh and on that side also missed Kaiser who was Dr Ford's friends and three other people\nThere's five people too it's not\nHe said she said she said he said he said he said he said [noise]\nSo the memory thing\nCan almost be taken off the table there is simply no evidence whatsoever\nNone that's what's so interesting there is no evidence whatsoever that this took place I I think that's worth saying and black and white [noise]\nThere is no evidence none and the only evidence she has given us turns out to lean in the direction of more no evidence [noise] um the memory thing is is is an odd thing the only thing I Would have added to what you said ... and that is a head scratcher\nIs that for everything she doesn't remember she does remember having one beer that has always been odd to me I don't know what\nTo make of it but again I don't think we need to make anything of it this thing didn't happen\nThe way she said with the guy she said did six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero be right back\nTo the news [laughter]\nOreo con cousin ... senators and pushing them to vote no\nThe confirmation of have an office is a free for our have professional\nHound Roberts has the

you could read it in one night drawing life by David go on tour in any event he had an op ed in the wall Street Journal a about a month ago\nAnd I think it might serve as a nice template for all of us as we have talked over the past several days about needing to restore and reform higher education in America these are our goals I think I think he's got it exactly right he writes ten things they didn't tell you\nThat freshmen orientation he writes welcome to Yale pleased disregard what you've been told so far and follow these\nThat first understand that you're here to learn how to be a good citizen of the United states many of you come from Japan are gone or or France and we're glad to have you but you can't teach you to be a good Japanese citizens and we don't know how nor can we teach you to be a global citizen or a citizen of\nThe world because there's really no such thing the globe has no citizens because the globe as such has no our religion music literature theater traditions folk songs heroes traumas or TV stations no taste fad styles treasures are shared experience so you might as well learn to be good Americans for now\nLike all nations America's defined by its share of experience and by the enemies it's made the Kaiser's the Nazis the Japanese imperialists and the Soviet Union among them\nAnd just the past century or so\nWe are the one nation that always marks itself C minus room for improvement Americans were constantly to clarify concentrate and distill our principles and become more like ourselves more like the lumina city on a hill to which all other\nNations look up that's less than one lesson to\nYou are now part owner of western civilization\nThis should be no surprise you have come after all to one of the country's leading schools for training western leaders\nYou can tell this and other American colleges are western because they are dedicated to noisy public argument about the truth to the teaching of history without chauvinist some facts journalism or self hatred and to competition among everyone over everything\nFurthermore we love sports more every year starting at age to\nUntil at least we die of sheer boredom [laughter] three now that you are college students learn some skills everything else can wait learning science mathematics or engineering centers on learning skills much of the arts letters and history is centered on skills to\nLearn as much music because you can master at least one foreign language completely reading and writing English however are the most important skills of all learn that first\nFor listen skeptically grade school education is built on the myth that teacher knows what he's doing\nHere things are different never close your mind the possibility that your teacher despite the authoritative ... own as many books papers ... epic poems his international reputation in this world wide following might not know what he's talking about [laughter]\nRight folks who've talked about learned ignoramus says there are many five [noise]\nRemember that a professor has no business mentioning his personal politics in class and for\nTeachers must not abused their positions of

okay any group should be fair game\nSeven if you want to be educated you can't skip the hard subjects you must master at least a year of college level biology and physics and you'd be foolish not to take a term of computer science\nYou must know contemporary history from the start of World War one and western history from the start\nOf the renaissance\nEight you must know the Bible and Shakespeare they used to be the shared heritage of all educated Americans in western civil civilizations still takes them for granted\nIf you don't know them you won't even know what you're missing

pointed out this is not a jury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt\nBut certainly got to be more likely than not which is what she said\n\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that have vouch for his reputation given that nobody's ever made a kind of allegation before given that he's now undergone seven background checks given that the four people Dr Ford say where

women should have an abortion was a medical decision one that should be made by doctors and he almost issued a warning that the decision are not be ... be construed any other way she was talked out of it\n\nAnd so for those of you who have turned this into a\nMan against woman thing just because everything\nThat you dislike and Donald Trump\nEverything he does everything he says you're going to attack it because you think he focused because you'd make you'd make it because you think he's a racist because you think this because you think that\nI guess what his approval ratings are up he's now at fifty percent according to the rest of my son gets wet the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans do have to be ten points just about a week or two ago is now plus two in favor of Democrats\nGuess what the attack\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh effective some leftist have referred to him as a attempted rape is for a serial rapist included a backlash and the backlash is going to motivate\nRepublicans even when Kavanaugh gets on because you've already signal that you intend if you take over the house to open up a pitchman investigations so I'm urging Republicans not to let their guard down just because\nKevin ... is likely to be confirmed for those of you who feel very strongly the other way and feel that this is a referendum against women that it means that you don't believe women means you're not taking a rape and abortion what rape and sexual assault and things like that seriously\nYou haven't been listening I Know you're just like this\nBut one of the reasons Donald Trump got elected because he promised to nominate judges that would follow the constitution this now he's second one\nAnd God willing in the creek don't rise\nAnd he gets re elected he may have one or two more so for all of you who are very very unhappy about this I Want to say that it's very sincerely\n[laughter]\nEight six six four three five two to five to\nEight six six four three five two to five to Susan Collins almost like she was giving a a a dissertation or or a brief in law school\nWent over the cases that uh the Republican appointees a head having to do with abortion that they didn't overturn roe v Wade or that frequently we don't know what judges are going to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut before we get so out of control you know ran we saw in this hearing\nI I think we are in one of the things I teach uh in addition to to my work on the court I I teach a course at ASU law school and constitutional law\nAnd one of the things that I I tell my students over and over again is that I Want them to develop a set of neutral principles that is principles that they will apply regardless of whose ox is being gored [noise]\nUm and that includes a belief in freedom of speech not just your own speech but your opponents speech right now I Would add to that the presumption of innocence or\nUm you know if you've got to believe in that for everybody if you don't then no one no one has that and and ah I care less about what those neutral principles are than I care that those neutral principles are adopted\nAnd you know it used to be almost every issue that I uh worked on a before becoming a justice\nUh there were a liberals who I Would work with on that issue and it would just be one issue and that we would agree on and we'd we'd agree to disagree on other issues\nAre nontraditional alliances you just don't see that very often today where where you find that common denominator and push forward\nUm instead it's it's a constant search to find out what you disagree about how to emphasize that and so yeah I think a a refresher course on civics refresher course on the NFL essay civility and on the instances in history\nWhere one side has ram through a position\nA are abusing or the most basic principles of of due process um and McCarthyism is a great great example of a\nBased on what has happened in the past couple of months\nAnd everything that has been found through another investigation as either being unreliable long cooperated falls are misleading ah wherever results like students are demanding and for the moment seem to have the momentum\nTo prevent professor professor Kavanaugh from teaching ever again at Harvard\nAh USA Today a published a and back to not bad stating that coach Brett Kavanaugh should stay off the basketball floor forever I mean\nIf that isn't remnant of\nThe McCarthy Era that way so you know a win against them and found\nSuch have such\nAs a terrible taste in our mouth over it here we are here we are we saw plain as day I started this I'm off with the statement regarding power and a question of the same set limit wrap this part up\nBy asking a very short and simple question\nIs what we have seen a sign of the weekend of power held by the people\nAnd the ... the strong and power belongs to the parties\nWhich in turn suggests that government is not functioning of by and for the people but instead government is truly controlled and as of by and for the two major parties\nWell a ... you know I really hope that's not the case or you may know Rudy than I Am I have been for many years of political independent in part\nBecause ah the domination of the parties as an Indian themselves a is I think very very distressing and I I Do think that we're we're coming up on that [noise] you know there's one real silver lining or that I saw in this whole model and it was a a\nA a statement I'm by a guy who is becoming one of my favorite statesmen in the country and that's been fast the senator from Nebraska\nAnd ah he was talking about listen why is this happening this is happening because Congress has ceded so much of its authority to the courts that the courts have become too powerful\nAnd uh we need to do our jobs and if we do our job is better than it won't matter quite so much who's appointed to the United States Supreme court\nAnd when you hear a civics lesson like that in the midst of people screaming in in ... each other you just have to take it and and hold it to your heart because uh you know if people start learning lessons like that then maybe we can make something positive out of this experience\nYeah he was very impressive I read about his comments or during a that particular day uh\nMe uh I was moved to a personal side we didn't have time to talk about a justice I'm Thomas and your life or or a justice Kavanaugh ah and you're a having bumped elbows with him\nOr nor have we had at a time to talk about\n\nCertain issues that will definitely come up before the court or that you feel well but I Will ask you this just to be a quick yes or no before we go into some personal things about you\n[noise]\nThis confirmation and feeding of judge Kavanaugh is that a good thing for America or bad thing\nYou mean that the fact that he was confirmed yes looking solely at at the question of his judicial philosophy and his qualifications I think it's a it's an outstanding thing\nRight now let's talk about your efforts to remain seated on the Arizona Supreme Court\n[noise] and a two thousand and\nSexting governor do see appointed due to the court\nAnd it is David and the constitution of the state that\nOnce someone as appointed to the court that\nThe individual\nStays\nStands for retention in an election two years after the appointment and then you served for six years before you have another election statewide\nAs I said you were appointed back in two thousand at sixteen and now it's time for you to come up for retention\n\nWithout reservation I just want to get this out [laughter]\nI support [laughter] you staying on the bench and ... and I asked everyone listening to not only vote for you but to let that\nChoice of them voting for you to be vocal lies with the voice and to speak out loud on your behalf\n\nYou're highly qualified your record as an attorney based on jurisprudence is packed up all both your career and personal achievements are stellar and quite often some of those things are without equal\nYour legal prowess your methods of analyzing and your commonsense approach coupled with the respect of the law makes you not only the choice for Arizona ends\nBut quite frankly past suddenly one day down the road for something even more [noise] as I said do you have my vote and that and my wife I'm pleased to call you my friend\nBut I think I'm while that is an honor\nTo itself\nI'm equally pleased to have you\nSitting on the bench it just makes\n\nIt makes doing what I Do a little more comfortable\nKnowing that not everything is going\nOff in a hand basket\nBut that we do have the diligence that's necessary on the bench\nAnd I brought some emails is okay if I read an email to sure sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped it he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number

just tuned in we have Dr Michael Pincus back in the studio with us today he's a leading authority on both natural and alternative health we've been talking about how critical vitamin C is in terms of overall health\nNow Dr bring as I got to ask the question I mean you know you you you've kind of talked a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough item and see but you know the reality is that I'm sure I'm not getting enough item and see based on what you said I I I I'm not arguing that point\nBut the reality is that I'm Still standing I I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here\nI mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin\nC. that you need to have in order to be healthy when\nYou're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a deem minus because they're already a for vitamin C. it's sixty milligrams sixty military ... inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. would determine so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the right amounts and the right form in order to get yourself into a high level health or why why is that is so critical do why is getting enough fight 'em and see so critical while\nJust recap number one your body doesn't make it\nToo is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least\nThree thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per day vitamin C. you're going to be someone who was on multiple medications you run into doctors you're got blood pressure problems\nYou don't make the good

he says hello welcome once again to help line by purity products\nHave your host marks the most so glad you joined us today it's a power pack program in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated\nAudiences around North America with a special segment on the French paradox\nDo you remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight\nOr energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll yes ... the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nOur guest today says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce over Twenty years Dr president has been an institutional New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a long time product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that their president\nWelcome aboard mark always great speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's tension has risen mirrors also nominate on those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News you know I read about twenty health journals a weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically runs her shoulders what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine it's found in\nPurple grape juice it's found in berries and the rebounding peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation and scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Ninety Ninety two when raspberry ... first isolated from red wine it\nWas also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well and this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms that even some fish well anything that extent of the life of anything is going to get the attention of a scientist you are absolutely wow\nWell by two thousand six fatty and scientists discovered that resveratrol extended the life of certain fish\nBy fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand six and here's what really got interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that red beret troll counter accent the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even sink to protect the intestines and McAllen definitely support it normal and cinematic activity in the body it improved indoor and\nIt was even a great study I think it's that sort of genetics and cell biology in France that show that it dramatically improved enduring story aerobic activity and it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading that even neutralizes free radicals\nBut the reason the bottom line reason market that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whatever our health is threatened any perceived threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened switches on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that against on a secular level but capitalism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the\nAccording to the work done by David St Clair at Harvard notice as important\nThe most potent activate or the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking Roseburg ... pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years on their co Q. formulas but now they feature co enzyme Q. ten would you say it's just as important as it was very troll especially for your heart health and you also see some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs coke you ten and what exactly is good for\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in the laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan\nAnd it appears that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity\nOf what we call a longevity gene they get switched on they help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this gene helps increase tissue repair and switched\nOn by a group of genes called sirtuin now they've found two things at Harvard number one caloric restriction increases these longevity genes these are two inch\nWell so does resveratrol\nAt least in their animal studies and this is exactly ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially using a traditional compound like ... ... talk at the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement that our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell ... that's the person you said it took you ten holds an elite status in the nutritional supplements industry has been so well documented and so well researched maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why cook you ten researchers so widely respected\nWell let's go back in Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin\nThe Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana University of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti oxygen as major studies major universities right here on the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies energetic mitochondria\nWithout co Q. ten you don't have an energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow document some charity products occasionally does these three bottles giveaway isn't this was something really special wasted is so important\nWell I mean you really get an opportunity you get a chance to see for yourself what I'm Talking about I\nMean you hear me say some pretty amazing things\nAnd you say well that's pretty interesting but until you know until you try this for yourself by taking too soft shelves a day of this co Q. super boost formula you're not going to really appreciate what I'm Talking about and the best way to do that is to call the number you gave out get your free supply try it for yourself and you'll see the difference\nMore with our guest Dr Allen precedent in the middle but right now already products recognize leader in the field of evidence base nutritional solutions has an incredible free model offered today for the first thousand color so don't miss this chance the phone call now operators are standing by the cause free\nOne eight hundred seven three six three three three one eight hundred seven three six three

limited one per household toll free number again one\nEight hundred seven three six three three three one eight hundred seven three six three three three\nNow that's a question we talked about the co Q. ten we talking about ... but you bend vitamin D to this and you've added vitamin B. twelve yeah now many people go through life not knowing when they've got a co Q. ten division see with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is less than it is one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine wow I mean that's a lot of people now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day of bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and\nA great new study out at the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and cold and health I mean who thinks that those things right\nYeah that's amazing", "year": "2018",
