think on it right now but I uh\n[noise] I'm One of the I I think I'm One of the few hosts a\nThat is just not afraid to take on these difficult race issues and I think if we can't talk about them then we're totally lost than we're nowhere and we do have to talk about them or I Want to do that in just a few moments as I say many of you may disagree with me and that's fine before I Do I Do have a\nCaller a who has been on hold for a bit I feel\nBadly about Bradley in may so welcome to the show Bradley\nSir how are you I'm not that great\nSo what are the things that I wanted to bring up was I guess more about reality first a dream pay more and more either left talking about\nFake reality and they didn't hurt it recently strong in Texas called themself that prompted from what I\nMean stream media saying that well she reaching out to some racist and so and so forth that like code word and on for ... sake\nYou know the accounting hearing and some of the individuals who are using these things and they they check reality and they they converted and perverted to\nA narrative that works for them listening to the mainstream media talking about these packages say well why don't have facts all of these individuals it's as if somebody was following Trump's Twitter pretty much putting the blame on Trump and his supporters\nVery directly biting the blame on Trump very directly so yes\nExactly and saying that in certain in one case saying that his supporters meet your tone down their political rhetoric that it's putting people lives in jeopardy rush is ironic because on the left are actually in some cases extreme left\nSo putting people in jeopardy\nAbsolutely insane and saying that we're ... we're there's ... right concern for future Joel ... you're listening to this the most these younger individuals will they eventually turned politics from policy\nTo re motion only voting on policies that they don't understand based off of one person's emotional response or whatever that is and completely\nChange your reality and turning it into something more and\nDangerous for the future of this\nCountry yeah you're you're you're absolutely right Bradley I I I I don't know how Hillary Clinton can get away with saying it's a difficult time we live in there's been too much division and divisiveness\nUh it's all come it's all come from the party out of power which is to say not Trump She was the one a week ago saying we can't be you cannot be civil with people who are trying to destroy your agenda\nThere can be no civility until we get back in power and she no lectures us on it being a difficult time with the rhetoric to trumped up\nUp today Joe Biden the uh it is on the same talking points he who in two thousand twelve yelled to a black audience that Mitt Romney was going to put them all back in chains\nUm you're you're absolutely right about this Bradley and all as far as that nationalist comment because I don't know if you saw the interaction between Donald Trump and Jim Acosta from CNN on it\nBut Jim Acosta asked him about it and he said don't you mean when you say that people here white nationalist or who the hell said white\nThey they they threw that in their Donald Trump never set it I mean I I did a monologue the other day I I won't be able to remember it um verbatim but someone had said something along the lines of Donald Trump oh you know what it was it was Charles Blow the New York times he was writing a column that Donald\nTrump is trying to do his best to preserve an America that will be a white America and safe for white Americans and\nAnd and I said you know I I just hate to do this I absolutely hate to do this but I'm going to do it with a man who\nYou know wanted some kind of edge vestige of white America have as his representative to the world\nHis permanent member representing the United nations be a woman of Indian descent would he have as his surgeon general the chief spokesman for health care or an African American a black man would he have an Arab American\nAs the head of a the department of health services would he have a African American a black man as the head\nOf housing and urban development issues to deal with poverty and the poor and on and on I went it would have an Asian American as a secretary of transfer I I hate to even do it that way but what the hell are they talking about\nThere inventing you're absolutely right Bradley Bayer inventing and injecting words like white into a phrase that is totally race neutral making your race toxic\nAnd then it sweeps through the um it sweeps through the are the what the wealth in Shanghai sweeps through the culture as if that's what Donald Trump said it isn't and it's not what he meant\nWhich brings me not German alive\nBradley I think you just got into a slightly bad patch I'm going to be give us a second or two to see if you get through it the connection just got kinda bad but yeah I mean yeah almost almost try again that there we go okay\nSo the concern that I have received from a playbook I'm trying to do and my concern when they do outside when they start to do things are just\nYou know [noise] ...\nDeadly very deadly and\nThat's all that's my last comment there was a desperation now there's a desperation they have which is which is running them farther left and\nInto a more heated rhetoric and more heated behavior um you know it's not enough to disagree with us um they can't argue with us so they censor us whether it's on a college campus\nOr on social media um it's not enough for them to run an election against us they have to claim that their losses due to a foreign powers influence\nIt's not enough you know for them to debate or a argue or campaign against us um even though they have no real countervailing policy or they have to\nClaim that our entire movement is one that is racist or um something else I guess sex us which is what they tried to do with the Brett Kavanaugh hearings on because when you do look at it and I'm open to this uh uh to uh to a counter argument but when you when you think what is it\nWhat really is it the Democrats in these congressional and Senate midterms are running on what is it they stand for um I've said it several times I'm just waiting to be challenged on it I think most people who take a a a an average to serious look at this\nRecognize that the things they have spoken about the most are\nRaising taxes which will remove approximately twenty five hundred dollars from an average American per year from their pocket book or from their savings if that's where they're putting it or from their investment if that's where they want to put it or wherever the Americans want to spend that money\nIt ah it would involve a abolishing um immigrations and Customs Enforcement\nWill involve impeachment hearings against Donald Trump though there is no crime he has committed\nAnd it will involve putting the IRS back into our healthcare decisions that's it that's what they got and surprise surprise people linked by in it so what do they do they ratchet everything up\nTo volume level eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen sixteen and now now over the last twenty four forty eight hours\nTake the word fake in in the phrase fake news the word fake is all of a sudden some kind of incitement to violence\n... ... why not

active in as a member of the house and of course there's a person who wore the uniform and more at a a ... a well so you weren't we didn't know it did not go without comment or notice that that was a very odd odd debate\nOh oh well enjoy your show I enjoy your perspective on a great job\nI'm well thank you I appreciate it thank you very much but can I ask you a question John are you still there\nDid you go he went okay I was going to asking the question that I've been talking to everyone I Know when everyone I see I've done some of it with the audience that are though I assume you're voting or from ... I'm\nA how close is this race do you think she actually wins\nUm and I think she does and I think she wins bigger than the polls are showing I obviously want us to see the copy of that I don't want her to press anyone from I don't want to I don't want to um I don't want to put the quietest on those who would go and work and actively campaigned an evangelist for her but\nUh I I think she's going to win by a lot larger of a margin I also you know we've got a lot of calls and emails\nAsking me and my opinion about a\nCertain propositions and certain candidate you know who we haven't gotten calls about and maybe it's not floated up the radar screw\nThe radar screen as as as strongly as others we haven't gotten a lot of calls about the race for attorney general\nAnd I gotta tell ya I'm a ... which is a standup guy he is a a great Arizona attorney general um and I like it when you're rolling up your sleeves when you're volunteering for candidates when you're helping out and want to look to other candidates to help out\nDon't neglect that race that's an important race for us to mark burn up which is an important a candidate running for reelection he is a good attorney general and it would be a um\nA a political tragedy\nTo have that race go neglected and see him not win reelection so do everything you can for him to while I Know you're stretched and working on behalf of others

number three you can go to nine sixty the Patriot dot com\nAnd get your ticket it'll be a lot of fun OK so looks like Megan Kelly is out that NBC a fire\nI criticized her um yesterday for\nOne thing she said in her apology\nShe had evidently the day before being a discussing Halloween costumes and how politically correct we've all become and saying what is and is not inappropriate Halloween costume\nUh the PC police having having run to rampant on this and I did not see that segment but I did see a video of her the following day which was yesterday where she had to apologize because evidently she had uh\nDefended the notion that it was okay for children or anyone dressing up in a column in costume to wear black face\n[noise] um and uh that was wrong and she issued an apology the following day a very sincere um apology in that apology\nUh she said um I have never been a PC kind of person but I Do understand the value and being sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity this past year has been so painful for many people of color the country feel so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and a fence\nThat was after she had already said I'm Sorry I'm and I criticized for for going just a little too far for overdoing it that sentence this past year has been so ... so painful for many people of color\nI I just think you can overdo those things and I thought she overdid it with that statement I don't know why this year has been so painful you can just say you were wrong\nUm you don't have to feed in\nTo uh the narrative that Hillary Clinton has been trying to perpetuate especially on a day like yesterday\nI had not however seen what the offending statements were the Megan Kelly I'm originally issued which was the day before as I say just two days ago I had not seen the discussion she had\nOn Halloween costumes and black face I have now I'm\nSeeing that she uh that apology didn't do evidently and she is being fired\nA because it was so offensive so I went back and I watched it to see what it was she said it was a panel she was on with um one of the Bush daughters or some other co hosts are guest I've never seen [noise] and uh\nMelissa Rivers I guess it was is that are nameless rivers the daughter of Joan Rivers\nHere's this fall entirety of what Megan Kelly said that was so offensive let me preface it by saying again I think she's wrong and I don't think there's any room for black face but listen this this is this is what has gotten her fired this discussion and listen to it\nLike a moral\n... you'll get in trouble if you are a white person or a black president but that is why we like\nWas a kid that was okay as long as you address character feels like housing is offensive to them then you shouldn't say it and that's why I think they mentioned people like you said it probably\nOf my complaints about society right now is Melissa what ever happened here what race you are asked that question [laughter]\nJust as ... running around and I want to play you know you're going to be it's going to be jarring dilemma thing in life is I Want someone that they would not think that the\n\n... I mean I think\nTo how far you can\nSee why\nPeople to know where that line is right I mean I have a son that drafted the firemen with an accent and instead of carrying the X. around for like the way\nIt was a controversy on the New York with ... as she is Diana Ross and she made her scandal darker than it really is and people said that that was racist and I\nCould walk around her one day I I don't know how like that got race I mean it\nI don't think she really wanted to look like the animosity should've got that Michael jak okay and that that's\nPretty much it and then it went into something else that's making Kelly's\nSuppose the defense of blackface okay she was wrong I I don't think it is okay\nUh to do that um to to to to to do that as it cost him but the context noticed the context in which she put it I I don't think this is right either but the context in which you put it was who doesn't like Diana Ross I don't think she actually knew what blackface meant\nI don't think Megan Kelly knows what that term actually means or didn't until the next day when she issue her apology [noise] um I don't think she had in her mind everything that that term\nAnd the minstrel shows um have have have a connotation and you got that that next day when she issued her apology she obviously had to have a speed lesson on it\nAnd what she did gosh I Wish we had the time to do it today we've kind of run out what she did was she had ruin Martin come on he's not someone I particularly think highly of\nBut he came on with Amy homes and he did a history lesson for the audience and whoever was watching and Meghan\nAs to why the term black face why the use of black face and what minstrel shows actually have meant in our history it was [noise] I have to tell you as someone who knows a little bit about it and I think more than Megan\nIt was a fascinating only good history that Roland Martin did I haven't watched him in a long time I used to not like I'm very much but I Will tell you it was a great history lesson if you want to get it on\nYouTube or if you want to pick up with me on this tomorrow I'll play it [noise] it was a really good history lesson and I'll tell you so Megan Kelly misstep [noise] she gave a full on apologies and then [noise]\nHad Roland Martin on to teach the country the history of blackface and minstrel shows [noise] I got to tell you if you're going to air in this country and turn it into a teachable moment it couldn't have been better I was impressed [noise]\nI was impressed with that history lesson that she aired in that role and deliver [noise] and it was really good and now for this she's getting fired and I will tell you something\nThat will tell you something I haven't even heard the word minstrel show [noise] until the last month [noise] and the only places I heard it [noise] we're from Don woman criticizing Kanye West [noise] and from Juan Williams criticizing silk\n[noise] shame on them [noise]\nBut this has gone too far [noise]\nThe following they paid political announcement over your the diction shuttered too many lives and broken the hearts of too many families be time for toughness and resolve\nHas been Congress hybrid led the fight secure the border we need to crack down on drug cartels stop the flow of heroin and send to know that border\nInto our neighborhood as your senator audience warrior against the cartels any opioid epidemic\nLaw enforcement officials on the front lines of the border crisis no we can count on Mars or ... years ago when president of the national border patrol come we need leaders will help was fixed the border crisis\nIn cinema opposed funding to help law enforcement Pfizer drug cartels she supported dangerous sanctuary city policies just a cinema is weak on border security\nThe national border patrol ... also is crowds when doors\n... percent am I going to tell a candidate for you\nSelling for Senate did you have the big media dot com was named website every Arizona should know more than Thirty Years' ac big media has dropped readers that states most compelling business a lifestyle news do newsletters and award winning publications such as Arizona businesses\nWaking Arizona magazine and for all your business real estate traveling lifestyle news at age ... the media dot com bust B.

Larry even with the feeling guys are here and if there's something you ought to shoot me via Twitter at\nMark Davis M. A. R. K. Davis that's another all show that takes place over there but this is the one but but I liked the best one that involves you calling us when we were here on many Larry Elder show eight eight eight nine seven one stage\nOr why did they call it the stupid a package Bob story\nThe story at its core\nIs very serious anytime someone sends\nA incendiary device you are a real bomb fake bombs that looks like a bomb attempt to scare to kill somebody or just scare somebody is a terrible terrible crime right so let's just stipulate that\nIt's terrible and by the way who else said that that would be President Trump all day yesterday and it wasn't quite enough\nIt wasn't quite enough for a punitive media culture that seeks to milk which is an opportunistic media culture that seeks to take advantage of this and make it seem like it's Trump's fault\nThe reasons CNN got targeted is because Trump called them fake news or you know high\nThis is ridiculous and this is going to backfire because there is obvious and proper embassy for anybody that gets a a a bomb or something that looks like a bomb in the mail or dropped off by a courier\nThe people on this target list you can either Clinton's the Obamas Eric Holder Joe Biden Robert Deniro these people make my church\nBut I don't want to get a bomb in the mail no decent person does and then this and so the president was saying exactly the right things and so what have we been treated to in the last twenty four hours well he didn't call him he didn't call the plunge called the Obamas just to let them know hey we got this stupid\nIdea is that what Bill Clinton doesn't know what I Do wonder if I got older they called me I just wanted to do about it by going to give other moms drop it even though we're doing\nJust stop it this is what makes the story stupid in the hands of today's media pretty serious cut and dried story a little scary devices sent through the mail to people becomes needlessly amped up\nInto you know welcome to twenty eight chain where a media culture that has poisoned discourse a million times worse than President Trump ever has for ever could\nIs now wagging its finger at him widely Springer at us and they're they're daring to tell us how to speak and how to act\nLike crazy\nNow is the president United States [noise] aid\nBrash sharp elbows to wean spoken refused to kind of guy in terms of a communication skill and stolen\nDoes that ruffled some feathers from time to time yes it does has he done a couple of things that even made me go oh sure you're killing me a little here yes let's stipulate that [noise]\nBut for CNN in part to hedge your to the jets the discourse in America is a is is tainted because of it as you\nAre in most specifically because he's come after them

was a\nNo your ears you pray don't mess up my own story the packages received by several key Democrats and CNN like they need to be separated out of the list of the Democrats [noise] sorry I digress\nI'm In the midst of of all of his hand wringing\nIf the president has at times dropped the fake news moniker on people it's because they totally do that Trump is racist fake news he insulted all Mexicans is fake news\nThey may crap up because they hate his guts the fake news accusation is one hundred percent deserved to\nGet argue all day over whether that's a tone you want the president take whatever that is stylistic side show bladder we are in aid but I'll tell you one thing ugly bubble there you go back but I'll tell you what a [noise]\nI'll tell you what is absolutely true and that is that the media culture that hate his guts call it a racist every day\nThe other day the president was just down the highway for me in Houston at the at the rally for Ted Cruz that made people's heads exploded I Love it [noise] um and he said the eye of the I Am a nationalist I Am America First country first\nAs opposed to a global list a stride\nTo making sure the world is okay and we're but one calling the wheel of the world\nNow I'm a nationalist he said I put my country first my nation nation nationalist get hit nationalist rather than global list some people didn't get it but I totally got it but they just may do well and there was Jim Acosta peers are here's a prince ...\nDone as president I'm just I'm just wondering if if you knew that when you were talking about being a nationalist was that a dog whistle was that kind of a wink\nAnd a nudge to Nazis white supremacists was it a reference to white nationalism CNN\nThe people who are lecturing us today about how a president ought to talk\nHere at six sixty am answer in Dallas Fort Worth and I told them not tell you what I have no idea what to believe I uh I I absolutely field for anybody who received a

so [laughter] you know even at\nThe end of a hobby month so I have been [noise] I'm trying to bone up on my a disaster movies and we've been watching uh trying to watch one a week classic ones and then we'll get into the discussion on what\nConstitutes a disaster movie uh it's kind of oh I Know when I see it kind of thing [laughter] my uh my girlfriend said to me it would die hard constitute a disaster movie no I said it's a Christmas movie and beyond that no it's a I think it's just an action movie\nUm but then it raises the question is just a disaster movie ... and we'll take your opinions your recommendations you're inside\nThe ones that I was burning up on what the classics like the Poseidon adventure the burning and uh uh the towering inferno amazing cast by the way\nAnyway we'll talk about all that but it's your show and I put on the topic\nOf the discussions of course of what we've been through this week for use of the uh the blaming of Donald Trump for the actions of a madman\nUh I've spoken at length about that happy to do so more shame really I think on CNN and the New York times\nUm they are the a wrong prosecutor in the wrong courtroom uh we're also talking about the firing of Megyn Kelly and I think Laura from Phoenix is in on that point a law or good afternoon welcome\nEyes that how are you good can you hear me okay very well right\nHey let's on um I I was trying to send you a picture my family and I have four children and two thousand eleven we went and lived in the Caribbean and\nWe lived there for a year and a half on a Dutch island or a small one and\nA tradition and that that's a culture for cancer closet Santa Claus to come in on a boat\nAnd to greet the children at the dog and so ... came in and I I laugh because he was a black man\nWho had painted his face you know with white deaf did was melting because it was really you know muggy there uh-huh and I thought I thought well that's very interesting we we laughed at it we didn't you know we didn't we we were used to it but it it was very interesting because culturally there and there was\nNever a question about whether that was okay it was just that's how we did it mhm now and we had um a lot of experiences there I'm a high school teacher actually here in Phoenix and um this subject comes up of racism all the time for me and I think about it a lot\nAnd I I I like to tell my students about one experience I had on the Caribbean\nWe were one of only two families from America there\n[noise] and about I Would say Ninety seven percent of people that were black thumb on and then it's just a few you know their whole families that works on the Netherlands\nAnd they were white and certainly interesting because um there was one grocery store and when I went to the grocery store I had to go there it was very small and kind of not very clean and whatnot that we're going to buy food it was thrown my food at me I mean literally at the counter that would just shove it like go get it\nAnd treated you differently as a white person in other words ...\nYou know so I thought so I thought oh okay so let's hear the rest of the story they're interesting so\nMy assumption was well you know and I have a you know where the white people here and they treat it like this and I'm getting a taste of what race him some bill like on the other end ha ha\nI'm so it was very\nThat would be the natural reaction I think I Would have the same room as you've described it yeah\nOf course of course until one day my husband like medical issues like that but one day we were at dinner with one of the American didn't so happened to the African American and we told her story and she laughed and she said well they did is one thing to me a hug when why and I realize we we all realized it wasn't\nIt wasn't the assumption of our skin color they were\nThey were angry with that because of our American\nA hot so it was an anti hashing all those things are an anti now putting out an anti wider error racial thing\nExactly and it really it really made me stop and think about what my position is where I ... I Know that they were thinking and um because I was sure I had it right of\nCourse it was simply by the white people and I just had to learn to deal with that and will after six months they got now me and they were as nice as can be they realized that I was just a person like that they had to get not me but it\nReally ... by the way this does give lie to the notion that only watch can be you know a bigoted and I I I I we shouldn't have to be able to say that but if Louis Farrakhan wasn't enough or are you ah this this morning it was an interesting take on it yeah\nIt is and it was a tough but I'll tell you just weeks ago I had a student um gotten a girl started screaming at another student there were freshmen because he had said the N. word it was a white boy that said the N. word to his his African American friend\nWhat are your team fourteen huh\nAnd I took all three of them aside and we had to talk about you know death and and I got straight outlook I\nYou know I I haven't talked to the white kid alone afterwards because I didn't want him to kill she was saying well he was saying was he was talking like even the ... and I said you know I understand you hear that music you say it and then you don't realize that for some you know and\nIt offensive even though you didn't mean it offensively and so we had a good conversation and he was actually really appreciate that that I didn't ... act down on him [noise] but then I found out can they really are that\nThe African American kid had been saying to block of who got really upset that yeah you know when I got home I thought about life shouldn't have gotten something not just the other kids that cute but he didn't know that and he went bang and he didn't get in trouble\nOr ... ... ... ... well ...\nThere's so much in what you said your ... and you know the first thing I Want to uh you know I Want to say is\nOne of the interesting features of our age is that so much of these negative connotations words statements images have been a brought back I mean the N. word for example was for the most part gone until rap\nWas for the most white gone in at least in at least in in in in ... above the Mason Dixon Line it was mostly gone until rap and ... and I hate that it's a word that should be gone and should never see the light of day\nI'm right that's that's one thing the other thing is so was the word minstrel show\nUntil a month ago I hadn't heard that I don't know you're a teacher so you may hear more and deal with it more I had not heard the word minstrel show\nA until I saw um one Williams on Fox News use it to describe diamond in silk in a pejorative sense do you know who dominance silk are they are now two black women who are popular on the Internet for being\nA big yeah I'm ... and that I have an actor I don't know if it's an act they have a they have a [noise] whatever they have a thing [laughter] I don't I don't know if I I Am it's probably not an act but I had not heard that but he denounced the ... and then I heard it again about\nTwo weeks ago when Don Lemon was Curtis from Don Lemon on CNN who was criticizing Kanye West for his support of Donald Trump so you know first of all the bringing back of the things that were rightfully um for the most part vanished\nI'm going to the dust to the dustbin of history is um it's it's a shame that they are back a it's a ... brought him back I don't want to say like they were um never used by whites of course but for the most part they were gone but it there was a re normalization of it is that right totally unhealthy and why by the way\nA such\nArtists like um when Marsalis has denounced rap so much uh for for just that sort of thing he said it does far more damage to the black community when Confederate statues that's wanting more so that was um he who knows something about traditional black music don't you think [noise] um\n... yeah right [laughter] I Am that having\nBeen said you you you raised another interesting thing on the Santa Claus Santa Claus story that I Can't get out of my head which is you had a black person playing center clause because you've lived in a society that was affected really Ninety eight percent black\nBut they wanted to portray cinder clause as what he was which was white correct or Caucasian and Sam ...\nHe puts on white makeup I suppose is the best word for it and\nNo ... no one shot at twice about it right anything we kind of okay so what did what he was doing it in a way out of a sign as it I I I Would assume I don't know any of these characters as a sign of respect in a way\nBack to making I only was talking about the case of someone dressing up as Diana Ross as a sign of respect\nExactly yeah yeah but it's an odd circle it's an odd circle\nIt is and the bottom line is that it\nYou know we the reason\nThat we're I feel actually used in making this had important and I need your patients a little more can you hold just a little longer Laura this is important [noise] All right I'm going to you I'm keeping you after class and how do you go away we'll be right back six zero to five zero eight\nEven if they're just just a stupid mistake they will still grind you under their heel and make you ... you know and ah and destroy your career I mean it's it is so we we it tells us the nature of our opponents shall we say ... um\nBut it has something to do so now how about the ability I mean you heard what she said but was offensive you heard the offensive line [noise]\nUm I I don't you don't have to conclude as I did that it was um innocence from ignorance I that's my conclusion she was a during ... don't think she knew what she was talking about clumsy was your word I'm that's fine [noise] um\nI think I read the right thing with all of it frankly um I\nThink she did the only thing she could do was she spread\nUnintentionally an out of ignorance spread of false idea on how what black\nFace right now is that true enough true enough but her apology the next day I saw was as sincere as as could be and what does it say about a society or countries that won't let you apologize for saying something\nYou didn't mean to say I don't think she did mean to be offensive I don't think she meant often ...\nWhat it is is the college campus insanity where whoever is offended the most dictates what happens and what gets to be said yep and\nIt's it is permeating our society now ... so ... and it is the opposite of of promotion of understanding magnanimity and a mutual understanding I respect\nYou know the vice of by design yes yes that is well\nIt's a it's very dangerous oh\nNo it is dangerous and and it's you know it's anti education it's anti thought it's anti everything good frankly I mean I I worry about the society when I see what's going on here I really do worry about it\nWell the left is is is corrosion and or if you you can have forgiveness and magnanimity or you can have the destruction of people who say something that might be a little wrong mhm and do everything they can set it right mhm but\nIt's still not good enough now isn't highly abusive\nAnd its totalitarian image think\nAgreed it's abusive and totalitarian that's exactly what it is held those are the right words\nAnd let's do\nIt the human rights or some people like Megan Kelly but the flipside of that is is that you're going to have somebody like Mr Farrah Khan yep in the presence of a former president\nThere there was another matter slapping each other before before they get on stage together yeah yeah you're getting it up yeah and so and and Mr Farrah Khan is set to bury terrible thing the worse about is that the worst things you can say\nYeah yeah you know and he has compared Jewish people determined yes and and ... and ... yes\nIt is really an he's perfect it's perfectly acceptable that he's in public\nAnd in ... and he has called ... it's an interesting thing to point out on a week like this\nYeah and it's not on presidential for Bill Clinton\nTo be in his presence on television I give you the age we live in [noise]\nBut it is on presidential for Trump to\nYou know do whatever you thought about fake news
