must have been a point in your life or in your young adulthood or even perhaps your salad years\nWhere you made your first effort at being a conservative you had to think about it or or or or engage

the twenty dollars St gardens and liberty had gold coins they haven't\nBroken even yet on their investment announce incredible given the boulders resin approximately three hundred percent since then so while the timing is everything if you buy the wrong coins the timing doesn't matter\nThat much having a dealer who cares about positioning you in the right types of coins or bullying will mean more

McSally rally yeah it was Mitt Romney and dug do see a had a great time you know went really well but I thought there was something very curious about it oh\nWhich is that even though if you look at it on the audience about seven hundred people you know uh these this is clearly Trump's party okay every other head ... sure okay sure\nUm second one woman carried a batter saying Trump twenty twenty excellent\nNot one\nOf the speakers said made any reference to the president even not forget about the name Trump even the president okay was not mentioned was granted of course the whole point of the

me also on the house the suits upstairs are covering the dinner so\nIt's when when Dan is in Phoenix than you or were gracious to hold over the break I appreciate it you were talking to us about them excel a rally in Gilbert that you went to featuring a Mitt Romney and the curious a name I eat a head of the party and our president was not mentioned\n[noise] yeah I have to tell you when when Mitt Romney says speaks in these generic terms of\nUm conservative values and Republicans I'm thinking\nIn twenty close to twenty twenty Jeff Flake is going to be leading a mutiny to try to get somebody to ... in the party to run against the president perhaps himself perhaps someone else like Mitt Romney\nAnd it just may tell me if I'm paranoid but it would really be upsetting to me if Mitt Romney and Jon case ec and the sore losers from two thousand sixteen all started running on a mutiny campaign to challenge the president\nLeft them in a you know what I say let them ah I don't think Jeff Flake is going to be able to do it um I've heard obviously are the people make the analysis and and and it's you know he looks like he's trying to do something otherwise he wouldn't have written a book and he wouldn't have been giving speeches he's been giving\nAnd he wouldn't have tried to maintain the or the cue rating that he's tried to maintain but I don't think it's going to go anywhere and I'll tell you why for a couple of reasons Dan one ... is his latest polling he's underwater not just Democrats but with Republicans I don't know what his bases remember when he decided to bow out\nHe was pulling a around here that he had a poll last summer with an Eighteen percent approval rate in Arizona [noise]\nUm I I don't know how he attracts Democrats if he maintains even a modicum of ... of of the social conservatism which he claims to stand for and which you know he has voted on and you know voted by stood by on on the one hand on\nThe other um what is there to like what is the program what you know a contrast his continual gain saying nay saying of President Trump but compared to his Noah T I I I don't I ... the ... what's the comparison I mean you know\nIf if you had the record of this president and what President wouldn't want this record by the way two years and nothing's could change and three in the third year the fourth year I suppose that's possible of course but with this record why do you think it's wise to attack him\n\nReally I mean I I think ... sick and flake or marginalizing themselves into irrelevance and I think they've been on that track for some time quite frankly\nI think you're right and uh I just I just hope you know\nA ... sometimes you know there's sheep followed while they're sheep\nYou know yeah and sometimes it's about the one she palm told but I think he's going to be one sheet them\nYou know the story I'm alluding [laughter] really [laughter] okay [laughter]\nI'm I'm Amazed I Am amazed that not one of them are deemed inappropriate with all the mega paraphernalia and the audience not one of 'em deemed inappropriate to put a word in for the president but then again I remind\nYou that you know this is the man Mitt Romney who in twenty sixteen give a big speech against Trump here's a quote from it dishonesty is Trump's homework\n[noise] um [noise] the bowling the greed showing off the massage need the third grade theatrics um I I don't know why you need Mitt Romney if you're Martha McSally I could see Mitt Romney needing Martha McSally I don't see how Martha McSally needs Mitt Romney\nBut it was more than ... of them yeah sure and I assume it was set up by her\nHandle Oh yes Oh yes and I know many of them in like them very very much we may not agree on everything I certainly don't think a Mitt Romney has is an help for I really don't you asked\nIt suggests to me that there are still some people in our party who are afraid of Donald Trump and still think that he's radioactive\nI don't know if it's that so much Dan I think um and there might be an element of that but I also think that they are um there's there's an element in the party\nAnd then the fundraising circles that just any name is a good name you know any name is a good name and I mean I\nI think the question answers itself if there were seven hundred people at the rally for Martha McSally because of Mitt Romney think about how many there would've been at the rally for Martha McSally if Donald Trump came in for\nI mean ... the question answers itself [noise]\nOkay thanks I drank right doesn't it\n[noise]\nI I'm I'm just concerned about the Martha McSally and the people that are hand\nLie I get it I Do get it and I understand that yeah yeah no I get it that having been said will roll up our sleeves and do everything we can for you betcha you betcha thank you Dan thank you very much Brad it's been more than patient in cave creek high Brad\nOur I'm well sir thank you for your incredible patients\nWell I'll tell you I I've enjoyed

the front steps of our barracks over there are bears is that [noise]\n... yeah well listen Brad welcome home and thank you for your job and your work and your effort for the United states thank you for your service I appreciate it I appreciate you\nKnow both times for that thank you\nGuess I just want to wrap up with a [noise]\nI I really have a hard time declaring myself a Republican mhm uh although the Republican uh represent the best conservative viewpoints out there today the the middle of the left the Democrats or\nYou know to either the Marxist socialist on those communist [laughter]\nSo anyway I Am a lager man mhm\nI wear my red hat all the time here in Arizona but the funny part is as I I went over to visit my daughter and son in law and an ocean side and I had my hat on and and my son in laws that do wherever that out here come on and I said\nFine I don't care if you go and do that go ahead those that did but out\nWere engaging in trees and by the way just stuff why this far worse than condemn this was far worse than her condemning Republicans as crazies\nRight All right well I I agree with you there I haven't heard that but I'm sure it will this weekend but in terms of being a conservative I you know I I I grew up back on the east coast my both my parents were artwork so\nWhereabouts toney Philadelphia area uh-huh yeah\nAnd so but but just in general I\nI I I've been were fifty seven I'm working on that well that and I'm sure that you know the\nWay if your work and if you've been in business whether you work with your hand or your whatever it is that you do if you're a worker I ever heard of it back to when you're working for a living and you're in business it's hard not to be conservative\nYeah it is hard not to be and yet we have this odd thing because there are an awful lot of people who work who are Democrats and an awful lot of millionaires and billionaires are given to the Democratic party [noise] um it's an odd thing I guess the only way I can explain it is that they can afford to be Democrats\nAdopting yeah I I I Can't explain I just know that for me for the big thing and did that for the last thirty and thirty five years and seeing what's going on that station and the growth of our federal government and all that say that to me it's very difficult not because I you know\nYeah I I honestly I'm with you Tony I I mean I think it's a common sense about it it's it's it's about creating economic environment whether it's smaller or larger businesses that puts them in the position we have now put them in with the reforms economic reforms Donald Trump has brought about\nWhere there are no longer talking\nAbout hiring freezes were there are no longer talking about wage freezes were there are no longer talking about\nNot expanding or perhaps even having to close as a lot of businesses did\nTheir talking not just a they've stopped not just talking about now they're not talking about expanding they're talking about wage increases they're talking about the increase is it's a whole other kind of the world and if you believe in that if you believe in employing people I I don't see how it is a close call\nYeah just one last quick thing it even for a Democrat I think really all we need to do for the upcoming elections play that comment from Iraq Obama that and what what did he say something along the lines of the three percent growth are long\nGone beyond when they were going to see those again right I think all you need to do is play that quote and then just got to vote against the numbers that were things

was running for president in Nineteen Seventy nine\nWell the um the election in November\nYeah in Nineteen eighty yeah\nYeah and uh 'cause that was my first selection I turned Eighteen okay in Seventy

I mean my family with a Democrat my you know my parents were Democrat I was supposed to vote Democrat was going to vote Democrat until I heard his speech I'm holding\nUp since you've been talking it's it's not a short speech by the way [laughter]\nAnd I said earlier about America yeah and\nA move from left to right it's it's just an interesting thing to me not to study by the way that may exist but

increase in welfare but anyway ... back to your point uh on the economics of things [laughter] um I um [noise] I\nI've always liked the Jack Kemp construction on this which is you can you simply cannot make things easier on the employee class by making things harder on the employer class\nAnd you know if I ever worked in a White House I Would I Would ask the president to put that above his desk in the oval office you cannot make things easier for the employee class by making things harder on the employer class I ... that axiom is is is just that I think an axiom truth that you can't escape\nYou know in ... county was certainly\nA good one that's for sure but thanks a lot of\nNo listen bread I appreciate the call and I appreciate the story edited in Peoria Hi Ed\nHey show a couple of things I did want to come as a couple of calls ago about the uh\nAd against mark yeah out here that same thing oh you wanted to\nSay that I Believe it was on TV and I was\nAll excited about it was great but as far as my switched from Democrat to conservative I\nWhen I was a young boy in California and my mom was a teacher or the California Teachers Association heavily all the way and so I got nearly what do I do to sign up sheet do what you are I signed up to and it probably wasn't until the\nLate Carter days early Reagan days that's which I think as we mentioned the hostage crisis\nInterest rates were soaring at that point in time and when I heard Ronald Reagan coming through in his speeches unfettered really got me excited plus\nWhen I was in California was the governor there and I do recall in a great impact on the economy there\nThere was one year where every single person that was a registered ... I Believe we've got three or four hundred dollar just extra refund from the state of California and I've been to China number so so that's my rise to a concert\nPeople thank you for that testimony ad for the history appreciate it yeah people um who are uh just probably I'm guessing a little younger than you have a hard time remembering how\nUh how how ... days those Carter years were and the residents I'm Reagan brought to not only the Republican Party but the conservative movement as as a mere counter posed as a mere counter poised to it\nWe had a caller ... earlier in the hour who was talking about a speech Reagan's\nOn the eve of the election in November of a Nineteen eighty and it's remarkable for a couple of things one is uh how many times he talks about America a forty nine times in this speech by the word count I use on my on my computer [laughter]\nBut you know he had a line that resonated after he talked about the conditions of America that you're talking about\nThe statistics of America he said if you feel that Mr Carter has faithful faithfully served America with the kind of confidence in distinction which deserve four more years in office than you should vote for him\nHe has given you the kind of leadership you're looking for a few instills in pride of country and a sense of optimism about your future than he should be reelected\nAnd you know that's really almost all the needed to be said almost all that needed to be said and of course Reagan had the um the stature and the demeanor to say it that way um it was a sad time for America was downtime for America\nAnd one of the lessons we can take from this is no matter how badly it may look from time to time here um you know we are a country of changing lights and within eight years you know it was probably the best times in many of our adult lifetimes within the matter of eight\nYears went from one of the worst one of the best we can do that here that's the fluidity of American politics and

discussion about this we can talk about this\n[noise] here's what gets me\nOver on MSNBC hall there were ridiculing him and where to join him ridicule yeah do you know what the most watched cable network for blacks is\nMSNBC and I've read that MSNBC hall\nAbout thirty percent of the ratings for black viewers due to the top\nCable channel watched by blacks in America and that is why you have people like Chris Matthews constantly constantly putting out the race card only to admit when his guard is down\nThey didn't believe it how do I know that ... is what he said before yesterday listen very carefully\nUnderstand President Trump did this as much as any of us do you wish you the ... thing and they get in the contest of ideas and politics than the other people don't do areas or the or the hip hop guy who apparently is as good as some sort of bizarre\nBecause this was just yesterday this is Chris Matthews explaining why in his view a current us was invited to the oval office\nOr politics that point I think it's also it's his runs against the idea that he's a racist it runs against the Trump is like when are they is that he's going after Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects as it comes to will in politics\nAnd that sort of a racial way and areas flip it around computers available but mainly it's for white people because why people won't vote for a guy most of them that they think they're racist\nDid you hear that most\nWe invited Kanye West in the oval office for white people because white people most of them won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist says Chris Matthews if that's what you believe in why is that you are constantly saying things like this when he said\nToday America First was not just the racial I mean the I should say racial the hit all areas of background suicide horse nothing about human rights something about gender right side of the things you hear from a Democrat\nIn Russia and that's a serious thing did you notice anything\nSort of ethnic about his attitude that answer your question something wasn't it wasn't it says something about they have all the three hundred and some executions in Texas and they were on Syria I remember that was something that permit predated Trump but clearly is I think you think it is\nMaybe what did you think of this going up to the football players father I mean uh I I don't get it he just seems like there's a certain aspect he likes to go for people of color is sometimes I I notice a pattern\nI'm Sorry I noticed that fighting has brutality to would be added to the ethics each of the racial things should be ... I think his love him saying throw them out from a big top where these people or anything that suggests some sort of an ... you know shifting sort of point of view\n[noise] went to one of my high school reunion one of my classmates comes up to me and says\nI really enjoy your show don't belief or anything that you are but you say but I find it very entertaining and I and I and I know that you don't believe what you say either and he had a smile on his face as if to say you know I Know you're just saying stuff because she could make an income for you\nAnd I didn't smell back and I said uh would you mind telling me what you think upset that I don't believe\nIn any stop smiling you realized that he had said something that I found a little little offensive I repeated I said I get that a lot tell me what you think I said but I don't really believe throughout our blah blah blah blah\nChris Matthews is clearly saying a bunch of crap she doesn't believe\nHow does somebody\nCalled Trump or racist called Trump's supporters of racist\nAnd then say well the average white person would not vote for somebody if they thought he was a racist\n\nWhite but I Do understand President Trump did this as much as any of us do here we should\nDo is to say it does that thing and they get in the contest of ideas and politics than the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is as got some sort of bizarre politics\nWas defending freedom as an organization that advocates for the right people to freely live out their faith that reminds us that as Christians were called about our faith and the marketplace at our jobs at our schools\nWe also want people to remember that when they do that and they're persecuted for their faith that we will defend them and their right to live out their faith you\nKnow people often ask me elders ski what can I Do to get involved what can I Do to help what can I Do to help advance the cause of freedom in America and I was the same thing getting\nOff one of the ways you can get involved with by making a generous gift to the alliance defending freedom\nAnd today every donation you make will be doubled by special matching grant\nSo please call eight six six four three five two to five to that eight six six\nFour three five two to five to or go to my website Larry Elder dot com\nAnd click on the banner that read I Want to defend religious freedom\nThree hundred dollars will double the six hundred six hundred twelve hundred and so forth but whatever you can give eight six six four three five two to five to eight six six four three five two to five to ... to my website Larry Elder dot com and click on the banner that reads I wanted to defend religious freedom\nThank you so much\nAmong the critics\nOf what Kanye West it was Michael Eric Dyson listen to this this was white supremacy by Britain ... black mouth has said again I just this is white supremacy my ring true of course I'm Mitch McConnell what what what exactly was that this was white supremacy by ... is it covered under Obamacare\nBlack mouth is moving with white races ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles\nA black mouse is flowing white racist thoughts are flowing from Kanye West\nColder [noise]\nThis is just getting too too intense for me I Need somebody to help me with this\nThis was white supremacy by ... black mouth is moving with white races ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles Kanye West is engaging in one of the most in the various practices and yet\nAll black body and brain the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of hair in the black sentiments\nMan\nYeah without a thesaurus too I'm impressed\nThat have been shown shaken by people for ... checked\nFar more rigorous racist is that race is is that rises to inject\nCredentials Michelle Alexander has written about the new Jim Crow 'em and you know a ...

this New Yorkers should be free to tell the government who they are\nNot the government telling them who they are\nSo\nIf I have a right to determine or you have a right to determine what sex fewer IRA regardless our way were born\nAnd thereby you know we get to use whatever facility we decide makes us most comfortable at that particular moment\nHow will\nHow would I be addressed and anyone that isn't accepting of my gender declaration can I just call up the ACLU and go after those individuals as has been the case they saw probably get rich just soon people\nOrganizing and Oregon or sending people organizations and even my government but here's a really cool thing I can change my sex at whim\nAll I have to do is say today I Am one sex\nNow that doesn't mean I Can't be the other tomorrow or when ever it's just as I have read so often to use the laws on some of this in times past it is however you identify the van as to what makes you most comfortable\nIt's all about how I feel\nSo changing my sex and then you being required by law to see me as I now want just because of a law that says you have to then I ought to\nBe able to convince you to accept less obvious non physical things and doing a heck of a lot easier\nThan\nHaving you accept me as someone other than who you say standing before you see that makes sense to you\nI'll give you an example is good for you stands in elephant but the law has been changed that you have to believe\nFrom now on the elephant is whatever I say it is based on my comfort level and today I say that what you're actually looking at as a walrus mount an elephant\nAnd then you believe that\nSurely if some law can all through your powers of reasoning\nThem certainly changing things that aren't physical or material before you should be much easier for you to except\n\nFor instance forget color it isn't always a determining factor any way when it comes to race\nNow I should be able to say then if if I could change my sex at will and I've got the laws to back me up and I says I can do it surely I can say whatever race I feel comfortable being right now\n... I should be able to clarify choose that I Am and ... that I'm a Native American that I'm a Latino of Polynesian a Caucasian or some other race and it should be accepted\nIf I can change my sex where a lock and dam will change my race isn't it easier for me to convince you\nI'm of some other race than it is for me to convince you on the opposite of what stands correctly but for you\nOr that I'm not either of those and since I have the right to choose my sex surely I can choose my heritage picking my heritage can't be harder for me to convince you than my sex Bennett\nIf I decided to be a Native American then I think it's time I get to cash in on all those billions of dollars being taken in by the casinos all across the country too that are exempt from all sorts of laws in Texas\n\nI'm speaking of benefits if I can be whatever sex I Choose then what about my insurance\nRates my life insurance rate is higher than that of the of a female of the same age of the same health of the same credit score and other identical identifiers\nBy being a male I pay more\nMy longevity is shorter than that of a female so my life insurance costs more why doesn't the insurance company have to give me the rights of the gender I Choose if I like to do so at the time of my application\nAuto insurance same thing\nSame cars same driving record same credit score and yet as a male I pay more\nThan a female at the same\nIf you decide Europe female and the law says you must be accepted as one\n[laughter] why can't you pick and choose your right based on the gender you are most comfortable with when you take out a policy\n\nAnd then there's what about education is always a big issue about in state tuition versus out of state\nIf I can choose my sex odd darn well should be able to choose what state I say I live in\nRegardless of what state I actually reside in it should be easier to convince an admissions at whatever university that I live in that state\nWhether it's Colorado New York Oregon Washington Montana New Jersey Tennessee Texas Kansas on and on and on wherever\n\nIf I can determine my sex and tell the government this is now my sex then surely I can do something much easier and say hey I live here instead of their\nThen that makes sense\nI never say no because of this this this this this this this and that and that and that and that\n\nThen you're presenting may with double standards it's okay to declare I [laughter]\nTo zero eight one nine six zero\nYou know super see twenty two is packed with twenty two purer forms of vitamin C. that your body desperately needs

today he's a leading authority on both natural and alternative health we've been talking about how critical vitamin C is in terms of overall health\nNow documenting as I got to ask the question I mean you know you you you've kind of talked a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough for them and see but you know the reality is that I'm sure I'm not getting enough item and see based on what you said I I I'm not arguing that point\nBut the reality is that I'm Still standing I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here I mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to be healthy when you're talking about the government and nutrition and\nHealth recommendations boy they get like a deem minus because they're already a for vitamin C. it's sixty milligrams sixty military I'm the tire early inadequate\nThe RDA for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass and so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the right amount and the right form in order to get yourself\nInto a high level health or why why is that is so critical do why is getting enough fight 'em and see so critical\nWhile just recap number one your body doesn't make it\nToo is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least\nThree thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per

your body recognizes these from nature\nAnd there's there's a number of different sources from nature there's rose hips broccoli\nCertain type of cherry called an asteroid cherry lemons lines grapefruit with the super see twenty two and I've tried to duplicate what's in nature and I put it into one form I see okay well speaking of which can we can we make some I Want to try it right here

the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years and medicine\nDoctor can now has never endorsed a supplement for any comedy but that's all changing\nYour not only door says charities advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it joining us live from California\nDoctor canal welcome back to the program thanks now doctors now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the past year or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it just a little bit about how I got into this because I think it would give them information about how this evolved\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow doctor's advice that our government's advice and we started putting on the sun block and staying out of the fun at\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a nonprofit that vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information and you can possibly remember all about vitamin D\nAnd I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then\nWithin the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K

number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said I'm by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about

and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case Monday can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's the headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just gonna read off\nA list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek\nOr Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London

two thousand gene one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it and the only thing that can unlock it is light and then the\nThat's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it neat it just needs the key to unlock the right gene\nNot doctor you say we need five thousand I use per day now here's here's the problem I went through the the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou mentioned Colin healthier my family physician as a precautionary move will be on a pretty healthy dose of vitamin D what's the connection\nYeah what the reason you're gastroenterologist did that is because there's just a wealth of studies now that are coming out showing that coal and health and vitamin D levels are connected but at the same studies about breast tell the same studies about prostate health\nThis is like an insurance policy ... you're not not to take the citizens freak you out and\nAnd the other thing I Want to say you're listening in five years I don't want you to say I didn't know about this I was never told because you've been hold it right now you're being told for example in a number of places in the country if you walk into the emergency room with anything that might be your heart you know what they do\nBut it gives you a hundred thousand

there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficient we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now but it would be unethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient\nWhile we're conducting all the studies we need to the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're levels thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay [noise] level needs to be fifty or higher and to get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgain for those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most the best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself as a stand alone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand I you've tablets but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get with purity here why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that need to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D
