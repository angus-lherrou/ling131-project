motivate you your neighbors everybody that cares\nAnd hopes to have the great outcome here for our country to get out and vote for him mistakes I mean right here at home you when politics in your backyard that tell you when you win by one vote at a time one sign in your front yard you'd be amazed at the impact points that you can have\nIf you're not afraid to open your mouth but it's much easier to open your mouth and you know the candidates we actually have some basis of understanding and so on shows like this\nWe tried to bring it can it can hear what's going on from their perspective and really what they're now they're trying to accomplish but but how does a fight going today in Studio with me I've got the candidate for secretary of state\nThe Republican conservative candidate for secretary of state Steve Gainer and as you know he's fighting against are well known Democrat progressive Katie Hi Steve thanks for joining me\nOh thanks for having me Robert you gotta hey this is really crazy I mean we talked a little bit earlier in the break we were talking about the donations that are coming from out of state and then this whole concept of I vote voter registration can you can add to this all up on how that works\nYeah one of the major contributors to the Arizona Democrat Party which is running ads for Katie Hobbs is a an organization called I vote you go to their website I vote for America and what they say right there is there objective is to eliminate voter registration\nWhat they say is voter registration is the tool of voter suppression\nThey want to eliminate the whole process of voter registration so that I guess they want everybody to vote\nYou know it's pretty it's pretty pathetic in a sense I mean we talk a lot about how and we've and this is it pretty clear strategy by the left is where we get a lot of undocumented people that are moving into this country through the especially through our our southern border but a lot of people don't even talk about our northern border but they come here\nAnd one of the suppose it or documented strategies\nIs that the more people they can bring it whether it's through amnesty or some other means they can find a way to registration and vote now you're saying\nThat groups I vote are saying forget this whole registration thing what is going to get as many people to vote for us as we possibly can and if we're the ones that drive this likely they'll vote with us\nRight voters targeting secretary of state races in seven states around the country Arizona is right at the top of their list\nYou know it's interesting ... or or the Democrats in two thousand twelve had like this five state strategy and they believe that in Arizona was the last the fifth state and the strategy\nThat if they and they said hey if we win the state to state these four states then we're going to have the president's which they ended up with her I didn't have to go to Arizona the way they want to do and then if we can't when they said that we need ... you can't win the state we need Arizona anyway they had the strategy they took it down I was online as public for a little while\nAnd um it was it was pretty mind blowing but if you lose\nArizona you really pierce the red veil and our voter registrations in our favor we've got turned out in our favor we got a number of things but for whatever reason Republicans sometimes you know the red wave broken the beach\nAnd now people are standing around on the beach watching the blue waves kinda mountain grow and so it's terrifying to think that they could have control and there's no question in my mind I Know you you can't say it's all said\nGeorge Soros is behind this kind of movement because it's it's a it's almost a way to form anarchy and are bringing his progressive a mode of operation and and really the chaos that that follows this kind of nonsense\nWell look [noise] ... and in an open meeting that she wants to have the secretary of state's office to hold onto the Democrat wins and how quote unquote we're going to continue to make gains in the legislature this is what she says she wants to do a secretary of state\nSo she said she wants to be the secretary a straight to hold to help Democrats win elections\nThat's what she said yeah it's actually running on our commercials that we started yesterday on TV\nOkay good because I mean listen if you if you guys are are tuned in here and you're listening is this is the type of stuff that they called a slip up because I don't think anybody the right mind would say something like that especially when they're running for office that represents everybody this is this isn't integrity office this is the opposite you would hope\nPeople would actually quit messing around with the politics and just kind of focus and write down the fair way and make sure it's balance for everybody\nAnd she declares this and that should be terrifying to you I can understand the comments about the pick ups on the Senate and house you in the state which they haven't had any pickups and hopefully they won't right now going into this election but it should be terrifying to you if if that's the case now have you\nHow many how many interactions if you had when she's in a room with you and you've seen a lot of voters do you see your work in the room does she ever go around and talk to people or she can stay in her corner\nNo we we haven't really had many interactions I've been with or just twice on uh on TV or taping a TV segment and that's it so I don't have a good son so I just know from her voting record she's very far left\nAnd when you see organizations like our our vote come in behind her you you can see why if she's broadcasting that she wants to use the office to elect Democrats that's like a cat and it\nHas catnip and actually it's a great um metaphor because when you start thinking about catnip and when it does the cats and energize and right right makes him go wild and crazy and and that's the thing that I worry about is that the left has kind of lost their waste so much\nAnd many of them would say they appreciate the integrity of the system in our country and I mean you talk to your friends that are Democrats have they'll say that\nBut then when they hear something like this or who and then you get that small one percent ten percent whatever it is that starts to really turn the crank and that's where the problems come because they they mislead the public and what the real intention of the person running for them to get her office\nFor fortunately in our case we know and like right now so\nTalk talk a little about your vision and I mean that's one of the things that I I feel is absolutely boy the Democrats who want to call everybody raises biggest massaging as whatever their new label is for the day but what is your vision for the office going forward\nYeah the office needs to be turned around to me it looks like a classic corporate turned around the kind of done about ten times in my career\nUh it it's lost its way a little bit you need to redefine the mission and the goals that the right people in the right jobs and start serving the people and ... and in a nonpartisan way because the secretary of state's office needs to be run that way\nI'm ... and ... on my campaign staff I actually have Democrats than a Democrat and an independent\nUh I Would run the office the same way you can't have only Republicans in an office that's designed to serve all the people it's not a policy office it's\n... it's there to oversee elections of course there are other functions like the museum and they are cars but the key is making sure elections are run properly for everyone yeah\nWe've seen this I mean we see in the last couple of cycles are always seen some incredible disruption right to election process and some people felt like they couldn't but that they didn't have an opportunity to get out there and to express their\n... their once and who they wanted to vote for it because they lay the winds were too long they couldn't get to it or what have you or systems were broken like even his Maricopa County this last election cycle on how many hours or systems were now but they were down\nIn itself is pretty frustrating and I know that the state doesn't necessarily control the counties but you work as a smart partner how would you work with the county recorders 'cause I Know that that job at every level those are\nThat's a tough job for them and that is tough to interface with them\nAs well I've already started building relationships with the county folks are not well with every county but I Know quite a number of the counter recorders now\nI Would want to work with them in a partnership a especially in the smaller counties where they lack resources lack technology offer assistance that's what they need and and and the case of the larger counties or bring them some approaches to management that maybe they haven't thought about\nBecause the folks there are trying to do the best job they can but it's like about elections happened very infrequently so you want people with management experience and especially where we've had problems in Maricopa County work with them\nYeah it's it's interesting because you talk about the corporate I'm a corporate guy first you know not and I applied a lot of corporate principles when I was the chairman of the party and they said you can't do this\nYou can't not typical nontraditional thinking my gosh it's an operations for heaven's sakes and if you apply smart processes where you actually save some money creates an efficiency is and you actually hold people accountable you can have great outcomes when I hear you talk about that with the state I mean obviously there's laws that can govern your behavior is different than if you're just trying to corporation\nBut at the same time and it's it's interesting to hear you talk with a partnership with the kind of records 'cause that was one of the things I heard is a complaint with Ken Bennett Ken Bennett actually went out and visited\nConstantly with a kind of a course and they appreciate even though they didn't line up politically they knew what their jobs and they and they aligned and then I heard you know I don't know but this last cycle because I wasn't involved last two years is the chairman but even leading up to it I didn't hear that with Michele Reagan is that kind of what you've heard\nThat yeah there's been a lack of communication are kind of uh the county people feel that the the there was just a lack of a good relationship with the secretary of state it shouldn't be that way or it's not one so I Try to dominate the other that's working together to get the job done for the people\nWe're going everywhere we can talk to folks and um I've been getting a great reception I have to say so if\nYou're just joining us and we've got Steve gain or who's running for secretary of state here in Arizona and the events that he's talking about legislative district meetings in such that are around the state\nIf you have never been to one of those look it up look up if you know what legislative district you live and I live in L. D. Fifteen so if you look up legislative district Fifteen it'll show you where they meet and you can find your way to just make sure you don't pick the Democrat allegedly district Fifteen\nBecause you may be a little uncomfortable during their meeting but um and and this was finding your way so in some hills this Saturday that washes October twenty if\n... Republican club is a Senator Jon Kyl is going to be out there speaking Carson Dave Schweikert Steve Gainer and then you've got others that are running for various office but ... this is a good way where you get to look at Steve eyeball the eyeballs\nAnd that I that I appreciate the same with the with these legislative district meetings and that's one of the most powerful components of campaigning and it's funny 'cause he says I think we've got these three things when you're running at this point especially within the last couple of weeks here\nYou're on with your head cut off people just say go here do this in a lot of times you don't even know what your schedule looks like\nDr I generally am doing three today right mail sometimes for\nThat's impressive I mean it's there's a special titled endurance and I got to tell you also listening\nIf you if you've never run for office it's manic right the days that are way up days that are really not to feel terrible you ask yourself why am I doing this you've been a big investor in your own campaign so if you spend a heck of a lot of money to get beat up you know you're spending a lot of money to have a good outcome and it's it is painful to see this but\nWhen we show up at meetings that we should support and we when we re posting on Facebook and we moved things along with Twitter whatever other social media platforms it shows the candidates and they're not working for nothing it takes a special kind of courage to do it and your family yeah\nYeah it really does help when you get people supporting you does give you energy when I go home with my I've seen my kids are about those two\nYeah it's good well you know we're we're praying for I mean the the the mission is they have the best outcome for the state right now it's clear to me well you're not one ... anywhere near the capital anymore who she's gone you know let's let her daughter term she does she resigned run [noise]\nOr as you wait until after the death or rather I don't know\nSo it probably would rather than mine that's kind of what they do but it's like um nonetheless let's make sure she doesn't get elected so again if you're listening in your vote matters if you're registered to vote\nWhich I Hope everybody is if you're not registered to vote my uncle would have a field day with you either Vietnam her skin is World War two veteran I think you would flip over in his grave and find his way to you because you think that's the least patriotic thing and that uh that any human could ever doing this great country we have that privilege to vote but Steve hey again what is your website\nIt's gainer for SOS Ga why and or if or SOS dot com\nOkay so go there find your way to Steve learn more about um they're all the issues are very clear and your event schedule I Believe there's probably up there as well and I'm so\nThanks a lot for joining us to suck you very much a writer you guys have this Robert grams to them or stolen percent believes in Nineteen sixty the patriots ... elections the equations are simple if you want to win and you have to vote you have to get the most votes there's nothing more scientific\nThan that and the only way that we can actually win as we get our friends or family and those people that think like we do want to preserve these great governing principles as conservatives to get on both [noise]\nSo do you have a responsibility yes you do if you're listening today you've already engaged in the process so now what do you do to broadcast what do you do to encourage what are you doing to inspire people is yours usually as them taking people to the polls if so good job if not step it up\nTo get a drink of ... make it happen via the little spinach Popeye forms on but we got to make sure that we win this Robert Graham who you're back after the break today for ...

little boost of energy but hey you know to keep the energy going if you stay tuned here at about quarter to we've got Korea learned to ask you this joining us\nAnd if you don't know the name you should because he was leading the Trump campaign and the primary and and one just smashed right I mean that was a wild and crazy primary election was Seventeen get it to the polls it off\nAnd make that happen and that that's what it comes down to right now is that Steve gain or in the office he's\nRunning for secretary of state on the Republican side\nAnd bottom line is you want to win going into this last couple of weeks he was up like fourteen to sixteen points I gave her exact numbers actually a pretty darn healthy lead and it looked like things are great and then stiers and I vote other groups came in with over a million dollars in one hand it was one point eight million\nAnd I believe that total got pushed up to about two point four million that they're spending to take him down\nAnd then you hear things that kitty Hobbs says like she wants to get elected to be the secretary of state\nBecause why she wants to help other Democrats get elected or I got to tell you that job whether you're a Republican or a Democrat\nIs so important as it relates to the integrity of the voting process it's critical right you don't want anybody playing politics even if that person playing politics ways in a little bit more to your side\nYou don't want them paying politics with integrity vote we talk a lot about civil liberties in this country and you don't want anybody messing with another person's civil liberties\nDiscourage them down scare where Trump we're going to be in your state and like any like four days you know and I'm I'm going to be there when you do rally see what you do to help us out and get the word out I had my grandmother's a hundred and second birthday I think was then and so\nWe got a whole bunch of stuff working at our good friend Jeff too wet Jeff I tried to get Jeff on with us by the way today and uh you know because it's got this really important job you can't do it because uh the legal\nHe has he has clear through legal but I told her that we would just make fun of them now\nWithout him being on the phone with us but a Jeff sense as best but that was that was when everybody kind of started hitch wagons together and what a great outcome I tell you that was where people don't realize I think it was your first big public rally wasn't it\nIt really was and and the thing is uh you know I think you know what your health if you remember what we found a venue and then I called back and said I don't think there's been there's going to be big enough and then we ... we went to the next thing you really think there's\nGoing to be big enough right there was like that's from jobs I think we need a bigger boat and every time we thought we'd have the right place for people of Arizona\nTurning out and bigger and bigger numbers and\nAnd uh you know it was it it was such a great place for us the airport hangar is that we've used ... down there to come in and people always turn out they've always supported this president\nAnd what they've done is uh they gave a loud and clear message to your US Senator Jeff Flake is safe you know the Trump team and you can't be arguing ... before they retired um and now the president's coming down there and just a couple of days\nTo once again asked the people for Arizona just support his agenda\nSending our next Republican congresswoman give her the privilege of having an opportunity to be a next US Senator from Arizona and she will be more complex jelly will be on the Trump agenda I promise you that\nYeah for sure I mean that in in court you mentioned that em friday\nKnow drums going to be here and he had to President Trump is going to shake it up and he's going to be here and a mother make Sally is\nI just talked about she's up even the last poll that we've seen public pool she's up six points but it's one of fourteen point swing in her favor since the primary so the momentum is right but again it's back to the turnout I mean you've been traveling with the president what is kind of feel around the country right now I mean do you think they're going to have this big\nTakeover in the house and and I don't think the Senate's in jeopardy but what about the rest of the country\nBullet descendants definitely not in jeopardy as a matter of fact we're on the offensive so many great places from Indiana\nTo a Montana to North Dakota to Missouri icy pickups in all of those places I see is holding this done it in Arizona and Nevada I see a very competitive and West Virginia\nVery competitive at Michigan all of a sudden get a great candidate there so on election night twenty days from now we could pick up for five\nAnd six US Senate seat as it relates to the house and I do a lot of traveling around the country and I see the enthusiasm the crowds are for Trump are bigger than ever the crowds with the vice president like travel with on a regular basis are bigger than ever and there's this notion that there has been\nYou know just as this idea of hey everything is so great so we have a little apathy here and we don't have to be involved\nPeople have to remember this election in twenty days is not about Donald Trump but it is about his policy it's about the direction of the country it's about making sure that the men and women who serve an ice continue to protect us from the gangs of MS Thirteen and the people coming across the border because of the Democrats take control of the house\nThey want to dismantle ice that's their platform they wanna reached in people's tax cuts they want to cut military spending they want to do everything opposite of what this team has done for the first Twenty one months of his administration and I just don't think the people there is on offer them around the country want to take our country backwards\nNo it's crazy we just had a a ... for secretary of state here which is like our lieutenant governor and in the Democratic effort that are happening here they talk about this movement around the country club I vote they're turning seven states and what they are trying to do is they were when that office and then do away with voter registration as well\nI mean when I hear things like this it just like my head just wants to spin off my shoulders because I Can't even find my way to white American would think this way let alone whatever party but Americans think this way to the bus up the integrity of the vote\nIt's insane so not just the agenda items that are working so well for all Americans would then start to really throw our whole system in the draft you\nWell look I've got a ... a sad statement to make the Democrats hate this president more than they love their country and that's a sad thing to say because I've said it many times I didn't support Barack Obama when he ran for office like campaigned against him 'cause I thought we would have had a better chance was somebody else but when he became the president\nThe country's supported him because we want our country to be successful in by every measure whether it's economic security whether it's homeland security whether it's national security we're better off today than we were two years ago our economy is growing at over four percent something that nobody could be done the Democrats have no agenda\nThere running on you know in I items that\nFailed for the last ten years and they have nothing to talk about and so\nWhen I hear stories like what you just told me\nIt's so troubling to me that as the greatest country in the world I don't ever want to go and be apologetic about that I don't ever want to\nGo and have to say I'm not proud to be an American I don't ever want to take for granted the right to go and vote for the people that I think\nRepresent me the best 'cause that's what this\nCountry has been built on our opportunity to have our records at the ballot box but the people of Arizona and the people across the country are smart and they see the lives that the mainstream media puts out they see how biased they are against the president and the success that he had and let me just give one statistic\nOne sixty minutes interview Brock Obama when he was the president they interrupted him four times in one hour interview when they interview Donald Trump on Sunday they interrupted him sixty five times\n[laughter] if that doesn't tell you the difference in the way that the media trees this president from others then nothing does but the best part was even though they interrupt I'm sixty five times he came out on top because he's fighting for what he believes it and he doesn't take their false narratives as as factual\nWhere I Love them too he puts them in a box I mean I'll tell you like some of those trade a press conferences when they kept trying to go to a cabin on and just shut them down you're not talking about trade then you're not talking to me and then he just kept moving\nAlong and I think you know he did a lot of people in this country we really appreciate what he's doing he Corey I really appreciate on short notice or your good friend you've done some dynamic things you've got a book coming out called Trump's enemies corrects\nTrump's enemies with young right after the election rabbit I promise Inside Story what's really going on in Washington things he perhaps\nThat hey you've got to have a fantastic evening enjoy the family hopefully you get home enough to give them all squeezes that's Courtland ... thanks again gory hey this is this is it you heard it you know there's a real battle happening and we need to fight began and make it happen when you hear somebody like ... down to talk about it he's got a real perspective because he's been there done that on the ground\nWhere they have the with the president on a national basis he's he's none of we have to fight lean into this fight people\nAgain as Robert grab tune in\nFor ... believes that we'll be right back after this break and we'll wrap it up after the [noise]\n\nBrings everything

couple of comments I Want to get to\nThis being president is getting over his alleged lack of aggressive response to the apparent death of his Washington Post journalist the Saudi nationals who um had legal residents in America and the Saudis are saying hey we\nWe don't know we have nothing to do what to do a bunch of road guys the guy slipped on a bar soap leader's head I I and of course they're if they're all like they all lie over there\n\nThat's why we have spies we've and spy on our allies\nBecause everybody has an incentive to distort troops over there\nNow here's what I find fascinating on the part of the left this was a party the cold George W. Bush warmonger\nRushed into the war in Iraq never mind Fifteen months run up never mind he goes to Congress and get a resolution from the house religion from the Senate goes to the United nations resolution to link Saddam Hussein to declare what he has\nOn his face consequences so Bush was a war monger Bush lied people died\nNever mind Robert de Woodward who's now Johnny on the spot because he's written a book critical about Trump's wrote a book about George W Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq War and said that when George Tenet the CIA director present at the ...\nThe president's first reaction was very it bet your case and required to go back and get a lot more information to convince George W.

coming up next our yes um I wanted to make a point probably remember this too but if I recall it was Juanita ... testimony written testimony about what happened to her\nAnd what Bill Clinton did your data on reading that all the members of the house and it was that testimony that made the decision they made it than the motivation or work with impeachment against a bill\nThat's my memory too I hadn't thought about that until you brought it up in a long time Steve that is my memory to that a lot of jobs were on the floor when they looked at the way to the evidence of Juanita Broderick claims\nThat was a straw that broke camel\nEighteen two thousand and these teen whenever Hillary Clinton appears\nOn television to talk about women's rights to talk about the Republicans and Brett Kavanaugh I Am shocked I Am shocked at the media doesn't ask her about Juanita Broderick it as easy to ask her\nAbout Monica Lewinsky for those of you who don't know Juanita Broderick she is a strong woman into survivor who is the author of a book called you'd better put some ice on how I Survived being raped\nBy Bill Clinton\nJuanita thanks for joining us and welcome to the airwaves to Phoenix\nOh thank you for asking\nThank you also for your strength and you're witnessing for standing up for justice justice delayed we've been told is justice denied you're trying to do something about that and we'll get to that just a moment\nI'm Juanita for those of us who became familiar with your story in the late nineties\nWe have always found it a head scratcher and a jaw drop or that\nWhile those in the media that did take the time like we some Myers to investigate your claims and find them more than ... very very credible that they just never really attached\nIn any serious way to Bill Clinton I Wonder if you if it's not too uncomfortable for you might take a couple of moments and tell us the story that you became very well known for in the late nineties [noise]\nOver here in the uh uh nine age I was a\nOut and buy the polish jokes or you know I had to remain quiet for so many years and I just uh I didn't want to come forward and I I was to fry it and then in Nineteen Ninety eight hours like I said out is by the fall a journalist or I probably never would've got bored because\nI was fearful um but after that happened I was I was very upset and uh I did not declined and the olive Jones third and I thought that would be the end of it and I could stay out of it and go on go on with a lot a lot but as history shows\nI were a deposed by ... stars you know the independent counsel and just before a hours to be interviewed by the animal\nOr my son came journey and he had known about the right\nOr that it was about Eighteen or not getting any regime was in an attorney uh uh in Ninety and Ninety eight\nAnd he said mom you got to go ahead and tell the truth is ... ... this this theory is is the Paula Jones food was too old and I understand why you didn't want to go forward but you have to come forward now\nSo that when they're really came out uh uh all of my allegations against Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton\nYeah say something about what Hillary Clinton your experience with Hillary Clinton\nOh my gosh it was terrible uh about three weeks well distorted clarify I had worked in Bill Clinton's campaign for governor I was a nursing home owner and a registered nurse and I thought it would be interesting so I had a about three weeks prior to the right\nI had volunteered got around put up yard signs\nAnd was very active in the local county can pairing and during the time uh I arranged a fundraiser with my friends or their name was crushed oil\nA Mr Chris well with Dr Critchlow with my dad does and Betty his wife and I play tennis together so I had helped arrange refinery stricter Bill Clinton that their own\nLuckily home or in here\nAnd then after the right I hadn't decided you know I Would no longer volunteer I wanted nothing to do with the campaign\nAnd about three or four weeks later the fundraiser a arrives to and I had completely forgotten about it sure and Betty calls and says you know I Need the donors list and many other things I said okay I'll run those up to your\nUh before the meeting starts but I don't feel well and I'm not going to be able to stay for the main thing\nI did not want to come in contact with Bill are Hillary so I went up about thirty or forty five minutes early\nAnd gave her the information and gave the lady from this day and donors list that came up a chair that fundraiser and before I could get out of their uh I see them coming during the ... kitchen and as I had to the front door\nA Hillary Clinton will come straight farm the and just before she did that one of my friends a local pharmacist is name which\nChalk watch he rushes over Jimi he was the one that has driven from the airport and he comes over to me and he did not know about the right people didn't know he was a huge Clinton supporter and they said the topic of the conversation all the way from the airport was the Clintons asking me\nInformation about you\nJust sort of rose I just\nI thought my God I've got to get out of here as soon as he turned ... farm me\nAnd as she walks me that I thought oh my God here comes that for a wall and water on earth and I go on despite her right well and that was the big guys anyway she comes over to me tries to take hold my hand and says\nI just want you know have pre should get the bill and I are for everything your during his can time and I couldn't not it I could have stayed thank you but I turned to walk away I just had to get out of there but before I could\nUh someone grabs me from behind and I think even when I turn around it's her ... and she got a horrible look on her side than a brown and she pulls me down to her and she says during your understand\nEverything you do and I almost buying it I could not believe this woman was threatening me but that's exactly what she was doing and at that moment in time I really felt like she knew what had happened to me\nMhm mhm and you took that as a threat obviously as anyone more\nOh absolutely if you're seeing are getting meaner er and the way she looked at a grant me it was that it was frightening\nSo I Know this is tough to answer but uh I've been reading the stuff you've been writing on Twitter and saying elsewhere when you see the um hoopla for lack of a better word a from the likes of ... ski and MSNBC and on CNN\nWhen they play up the story of Stormy Daniels as she tells that um and they\nOnce in a while we'll bring up the story of Monica Lewinsky with Hillary Clinton they never go beyond Monica Lewinsky what is your sense of this ... what is your thought process\nOh ... no one when they have are in that predicament that no one\nWill ask Hillary Clinton what about Broderick wanted out Cathleen oily water out Leslie meal wait they will not delve into that and I do not understand why\nWell I I I think I understand why which is you you you you women you ladies are inconvenient to their political perspective I think that's what it frankly comes down to don't you don't you think it it it it's a it's selective political desire\nWell I I like to call it and got a fair enough I'll take care of all I just\nYou know I mean they are finally realizing the Democrat I mean more and more every day are finally realizing that I've been telling the truth or this past Twenty years but they just don't want to accept it\nYeah I think the one who can or you because this I was saying before you came on the show a Juanita we are talking to one meter Broderick\nAuthor of you better put some ice on that how I Survived being raped by Bill Clinton what I was saying is anyone who has looked at or into your story comes away flabbergasted that this actually is as you said it I'm from Lisa Meyers on down\nAnd that's why I think they just they just want to ignore you I don't think they want to get into it because it's uncomfortable for them and their politics\nWell I'm just hoping that we can get into it as you probably staying in Detroit or I had a fish\nYeah I was going to

or Iraq Obama you're absolutely right it comes through\nI thought I'm you know Donald Trump took some criticism for his interview on sixty minutes but I've talked to people who aren't naturally Trump supporters are not you know maybe where you are where I Am\nAnd they thought he was just fine and they thought what right does it would you know why she demanding why is she demanding concessions from

it one of them\nIs the media so overreaction over steps that I think it comes through to most independent minded people I think yeah I think their their their arrogance and aggression shows through um

try to pull the wool over their eyes he just comes off like you know in every man if you will and I think people tend to appreciate that so when he said something that might be offensive or\nA you know might raise the uh the hackles in the eyebrows of\nOf the professional a conservative journalist class if you will but you know what so what the the they're they're not to vote matters I think
