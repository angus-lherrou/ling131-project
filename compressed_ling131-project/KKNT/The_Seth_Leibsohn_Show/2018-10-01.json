{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "Uh before I dive into that you know it's interesting you look at how polarizing the cabin or a white man has made the conversation\nOn her see Ali who if you don't know her look her up look at our books look at her work uh she runs AJ foundation and uh she has um\nSuffered from abuse in Somalia than escaped to the Netherlands\nAnd then ultimately had to come here because of some of her work which uh I may not agree with a and many of or some of the statements regarding Islam and otherwise but yet the west is about free speech it's about having the ability to speak out\nAnd and yet\nA few days ago so she's become quite well known in her book nomad her book hair heretic are speaking out about what the root causes of terrorism radical Islamism and and other things and she simply wrote a simple tweet that said support Kavanaugh\nAnd here's a victim of female genital mutilation here's one of the leading icons of women's rights\nIn America speaking out saying that\nThis is not political that ultimately every woman's voice should be heard a but if it is exploited for political reasons without the rule of law without appropriate charges investigations corroborating evidence all the things that\nOne of our Maricopa County attorney's laid out Rachel Mitchell in her briefing that by the way is on line from this weekend a few pages of details that are um lay out why there's very little cooperating evidence and some of the accusations made\nA against Brett Kavanaugh and ultimately where\nWhat we do with this all end if you look what happened follow ions Twitter feed and you'll see\nSo much hate pushback that are saying oh we're I'm following you now and and you know I've always liked your commentary about women's rights et cetera but now you've just gone too far this is a bridge too far cetera et cetera and it's almost as if she committed\nHeresy for the leftist that she wrote a book heresy about Islam she committed heresy for the left which is\nNo matter what accusations are thrown than you must support it if it is presented by a woman and if the person who defends himself as a male than he does not have an equal right to that defense\nSo I'll let her speak for herself a and follow her on Twitter followers read her books and I think it's sort of as an ... demise is or what has happened\nBut Thirty years into Salman Rushdie is book\nAt the time I was in fifth grade sixth grade I think in Nineteen Seventy eight when he wrote this and uh when the revolution happened I mean and then ultimately uh uh he was condemned to death in February fourteen Nineteen eighty nine so it was published in the mid eighties\nAnd rush these work was sort of looked as an aberration that somehow well this may be this book went too far and the Islamists the aircraft for trying to control what was published in the left or so he has basically had to live under protection for most of his life since then\nUm now what\nHas the conversation evolved it hasn't than I think this is the peace if you look up this piece by a a brand that O'Neill we are all ayatollah now you would think that since Nineteen eighty nine\nWhen this death sentence was put out that there would have been a maturity and maturation of conversation about the need for Islam to come into the twenty first century and not have\nTheocratic speech prohibiting\nTyrants like home made me like king Solomon or any of the Saudi king or other Islamist or in the Muslim Brotherhood or the Pakistani government or any of these Islamic regimes that tried to limit what people say\nBut no\nThere has been fury descended upon anyone who criticizes Islamic leaders and if they are or be criticized the ideas you immediately get labeled as a bigot throws in Islam of full\nAnd yet as he notes in his piece it's important to bear in mind that this definition of that the definition of Islamophobia has been embraced even by the metropolitan police\nThe police for example in New York City he said\nAnyone who who how do you how do they define how does the New York city police who protected Salman Rushdie by the way how do they define it they said any view of Islam aesthetic separate irrational sexist or aggressive or as the political ideologies viewed as Islamophobia\nSo therefore any criticism of the reality of the establishment the Muslim leaders of what the way they interpret their own faith has become bigotry\nSo according to the police in New York anyone who holds these entirely legitimate secularists critical views of Islam is guilty of an active hatred of phobia of blasphemy in essence\nAnd and what's amazing to me is that these are the same people and then you wonder why we've talked to victimize Muslim women in New York who said that they've tried to call the police and the police often will not act because they're hamstrung\nBy political correctness by this Islamophobia\nDefinition by or other things that make them act in ways that just are not normal [noise] so [noise]\nThis piece we are all ayatollah now I have to tell you this cultural war that we're fighting [noise] dividing

my honor my humble honor to send in for him and his absence and uh so much going on talk about and I am blessed to have some wonderful guests that are joining us today and uh I've been a\nProbably most anticipating this hour as I've been wanting to spend some time talking about the culture war and what's happening you know this is far far deeper than simply an ideological struggle between conservatives and liberals it has it has\nWe have jumped the shark as a country if you will from the days of you know I was a physician to Congress or the navy doc for eleven years and I had the honor to serve as a non political\nYou know a officer as a medical officer the Congress and uh so how collegial are real as as difficult as times always had been politically\nUh I remember the time in which staunch enemies would stand and and give a praising speeches about or the other side and uh we hear about how a conservatives are Lindsey Graham voted for a sort of when your and a voted to support a\nA Ruth Bader Ginsburg and others even though the ideological disagreed with them they did not see anything a prohibitive in that uh actually one of the first piece is this just leaps and I wrote\nFor about me and the national review was a piece he wrote with Bill Bennett that talked about how\nI was appointed by Republicans to the commission of public diplomacy\nAnd it was one of the first appointments that was actually refused by the president even though they typically don't do that President Obama or if it's a Democratic president doesn't typically been deny an women from the other side but he decided to do that why we theorized that the time two thousand and eight or because of\nA Islamist influence in the White House I'm Sorry to the other nine Islamist influence in the White House in elsewhere but uh uh we never really got an answer I talk about that in my book a battle for the soul of Islam\nI without further ado I Want to bring on board to Robert Robert with us\nYes I Am\nSure thanks for being here Robert is the director of research with the conservative review and uh I I'm a good friends with George ... and a ... read a conservative you daily and are these guys have the polls\nHave the hand on the pulse of what's happening in Washington and I have to tell you the news cycle is doesn't seem to ah stop producing more and more agree just information that we just I never thought the national conversation would have degenerated into what had had over the weekend about beers and other things and to see\nWhat happened on Saturday Night live and elsewhere is just one of the things you're talking about before you came on the air Robert is or how this is beyond politics is about a culture war and we're we are this week with what's what's next\nOn the menu [laughter]\nWell I I think I think we're still in cabinet I'll watch you know is it break out without going to be the next\nUm Supreme Court justice and things like the Democrats like moving the goalposts but you're absolutely right Saturday live over the weekend you know you had it in that day and then it was friends with Harvey Weinstein as a bunch of other people that have been caught up in the moment\nYou know trying to portray someone like Brett Kavanaugh who know nothing is ever come out about them\nAbout him and so you know the week before he was going to be nominated to the Supreme Court playing them in a way to\nLook like already why or somebody else and you're absolutely right that the culture war made our I met him on but you might have met him to our current Andrew Breitbart used to always say oh this is downstream little culture and that's what the Democrats have been trying to do for the lessons and trying to do\nSince I've been a lot that I study so I I think what we're seeing now is you're seeing that yes the\nCIA is investigating but now the same people that said that well we will be enough to investigate it\nAre now saying that well we need more time because you know the FBI and investigate anything about seven hundred thousand emails on it and he earned less than a week\nAnd that's kind of where we call it yeah and and I think one of the reasons President Trump was elected\nWas successful is not only because he fought against the establishment establishment but he is a byproduct\nOf culture and I think one of the things that we need to get together quick because we're seeing how the Democrats are acting as a minority you imagine what will happen in a few months if they get to become a majority in the house or God Forbid the Senate [noise]\nSo um you know President Trump won the election because somehow he tapped into the cultural energy being from his a celebrity persona\nNever it may be but he tapped into the cultural energy that shift a lot more hearts and minds than do pundits and think tank folks and others that sits in the beltway swamp or bubble if you will\nAnd I think we're seeing now uh you know\nTwo things which is one is tribalism and second is this sort of ends justifies the means that you know Matt Damon doesn't care how duplicitous it is how they had they left\nForward as the sink or saying person they wouldn't criticize and yet Brett Kavanaugh was anything open in in the last segment in the last summer I was talking about how duplicitous loved about Ellison\nAllison's right Congressman Ellison is running for a G and his accuser has text messages has numbers are friends she reported domestic violence to this is all really within the last few years and yet the DNC seems to think there's not enough information there I mean it's just it's just amazing\nRight in the back but like you said it was that hatred and\nYou know they're saying the exact same thing that Republicans are saying about Dr Ford that there isn't enough evidence there but there was evidence they just found out that she won't release but one videotape but there's all that other evidence you talk about and they're saying the same thing it is it is a win at all costs\nMentality and and I think\nLike you said Donald Trump comes from a culture side and he knows how to tap into that and he knows how to play to it I think that's what scares the Democrats because some there hasn't been someone on the right or to the change of power\nOn the writer of conservatism that has to do with how to tap into that meaningful English did back in the early Nineteen nineties but they're having somebody in ... power it knows hardly at all to\nThe consciousness of the people in ... really turns heart and mind Donald\nTrump made the election about story about people left behind and those are all means conservatives often when we talk about policy\nTend to get wrong we don't talk about how the effect of the policy has hurt the person and could do that in ... um doesn't have a job because now that\nCame in in their factory by the way we talk about how that's been great for everybody as a whole and it's brought down prices and it's part of the standard of living but if you're in a pocket\nOf the United states do the downturn because of it you don't hold their\nOutlets prices come down at all you know with your life is worse today that it was before that and and you don't understand about the whole greater good now I Believe free trade is good but I think we do see some of those stories and we help them and that's something that Donald Trump didn't do and I think that there is a Democrat\nAnd again and I live in New York City it's a you know the Hollywood folks across the coast in between uh the the fly over\nThe that they do a between those two extremes of society or the scorched earth approach to win at any cost as you said\nA against Kevin I mean there's no doubt that had been switched Kevin I Would have gone through sailed through a to replace Scalia because that was a one for one\nBut now when you were placing Kennedy a swing vote a there is no holds barred they're doing a scorched earth approach to ah anyone and had an up and Kevin I Would have been or whoever else would have come\nA instead so do you see the um you know\nDo you see this backfiring in November what is what is happening are pulse are starting to look and say wow is what happened in two thousand sixteen going to be even worse against the Democrats because\nThe the ... the folks are flying over in the mid west than elsewhere or actually set up with this type of approach to American politics\nUm well the one the one that whole\nUm ... really come out that had it was taken after Kevin testimony was in Missouri and in Missouri\nAre are the Democrats have figured out a way to motivate the rest of America and I think if it stays with the motivation the way it is now the blue is going to be very different\n... crashed off shore you know the barrier islands and things like that it may pressure sure and I think what what people need to realize is\nYou know the polo showed that Hillary Clinton was on to win the popular vote and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but you know thank God we have an election system that is a Republican form of government and there's an electoral college\nBeing the congressional districts are even more partisan and gerrymandered\nThan they are so you know the the national polls don't translate to the old and I I think we're going to see that on the November now is it going to be enough to stop a blue wave at me historically we we know that the president's party loses\nSeats and the Congress I'm\nIn the first midterm election that that's what happened we will probably see that but are we going to be enough for them to to strip power from Democrat stirred up from Republicans or Democrats I don't I don't know\nI mean we may not but it's still too early\nTo show and you know you've really got to look at polling deeper than just the ...\nAnd in the culture wars per se where do you see it evolving next thing you know I see some of the conservative media and the less they talking about Kanye West and how he was booed and\nI really don't think that you know as much as it may give us a little gratification seeing some dissent on the left or with folks like tiny speaking up and we're in the make America great had\nA but at the end of the day I I mean he is so many issues that are are not conservative about him but I I get concerned when we over\nYou know over exaggerate or what's happening there though maybe maybe that is a sign of a deeper issue that we need to pay attention to\nWhat what what I think on a summer like 'em or eat or Canada so until you used to be a liberal or conservative\nI I think what they do is they give people the permission\nTo the liberty carrier for lack of a you know that's that's you know they they\nGive the people that normally wouldn't take a look at the Jordan Peterson um for yourself or or someone else on the right if they think they're in and talks about ideas they may not well did that person that that person may not normally take a look\nAt things like that you know and you have someone like Kanye West or you know in another ... also still music\nI'm about thirty pounds thirty English folk band right they took a picture with Jordan Peterson last week and some of the liberal class in Canada got upset because they took a picture with Jordan Peterson and for the liberal press in Canada Jordan the heat isn't the worst person in the world but you know that went out on their social media\nAnd they're made these people that are like hey showed and Peterson guy and they start listening to it\nThat's what the lab afraid of on places like YouTube and\nTwitter and Facebook even knows there's a you know the types of services biased far less is just so sad and and I think for someone like ... like they said is people [noise] you know you don't you hate to say permission [noise]\nBut it almost seems like they're missing so much that the points that they might not look at and they might say wow I I actually do believe\nI could I could not agree more you're right it's it's it's a permission to be heretical permission to fight the tribes to not be a member of the tribe and go back to true American values which are the belief and freedom and liberty in individuality rather than groupthink [noise]\nThank you Robert ... you know I'd ask all of you to go to a concert a review and take a look at his work is the director of research and as always a father with them so thanks for being with us\nOr Robert [noise] hey thanks for having me on a set of ...\nSay
