percent remain undivided excuse me undecided but get this this is an important part of this poll\nI'm going to say it twice once voters are told that the named witnesses denied any knowledge of the

evidence\nAnd that support goes up to sixty percent if the FBI report comes back also showing no corroboration why is this important it's important because it shows you what the media has done here\nIt shows you that if the people in the press if our friends in the media maybe our enemies in the media is a better way to put it if they would explain as breathless Lee is they explain what Brett Kavanaugh is accused of\nThat there is no corroborating evidence by in the identified witnesses\nSupport for Kevin ... is sixty percent support for his confirmation is between fifty seven and sixty percent that's a very very high number so greater numbers than any president in recent memory has been elected to the office with the huge number\nBut the press won't do that\nSo if you think

about a Maricopa County prosecutor ritual Mitchell who was hired to um investigated the claims of Christine Blasey Ford last week\nAnd how CNN op ed columnists and others are now going after her\n... ... ...\nWith the most extreme charges including the violation of her oath of office because she didn't find Christian forward credible a ... this this is a political charge the soup political charge of a terrible order\nIf you as a member of the bar whether you are a prosecutor or whether you're a member of the defense\nBar cannot come to your own conclusions even if they happen to support someone who's a Republican\nCan be charged for violating your oath of office in your oath to uphold the state constitution than we really are in the twilight zone gliders and Phoenix cloud welcome to the show\nI said how are you a call me just in time I'm stepping in somewhere so I have just a minute okay um the Rachel Mitchell thing I'd sure about sex crimes trial about a year and a half ago and I knew where she was going with all this\nBecause she has set up credit for the whole thing you did she knew she had five minutes or a light so you know it never bothered me what she was doing\nFor exactly what she was doing\nWell the funny thing is a lot of conservatives and a lot of Republicans initially initially were skeptical of her questioning because they thought she was being too polite to Christian forward now the claim from the left is of course because we have shifting standards and moving goal posts all the time\nIs that she violated or oath of office for not believing Christian for it it's really quite incredible Claude\nYeah what I saw I saw I I'm an editorial guard in response basically making the same argument against Rachel Michel ... in the Washington Post last week um by someone who was purportedly\nA former prosecutor yeah but you know climate should in what you're doing pretty well what did you ever prosecute yeah yeah you know where you're prosecuting a gumbo robberies\nAnd order there is an argument to be made that you could have used a defense counsel there's an argument to maybe you could use the ... council either way whoever was if we brought someone from the prosecution bar the defense bar these op eds would have come out because they would have immediately come to the same conclusions\nAbsolutely you know I I thought she handler sell very well um I I raised our Dr Ford was sympathetic I understand that yeah probably something happened but I don't believe it was Kevin\nOff you know it's it's a it's a line that we were all saying or something probably happened a for a while now but you know um their stuff coming out over the last forty eight hours one from ... years right this from have you seen what her six year old boys I have\nYeah that we now have every year ruled by the way I don't know that yeah why one rally okay what her yearbook say we have that now wait till I read some of those countries and I don't know ...

of that office but I Do not know Rachel Mitchell\nBut I Will tell you a\nA few of the things that she wrote in her conclusion and I also want to read you something a listener you know we love we love our listener so much a listener wrote a listener who has experience in this it's really quite brilliant we'll get to that to bill is in Scottsdale Hi Bill\nHow're you doing how you doing if I was

enough [laughter] I Wish I Wish you a speedy recovery but go ahead and exercise\nThose vocal chords against doctors advised [noise]\nOkay um well a few things you don't slash and burn politics that's been true of the left for a long time\nYou know back to the nineties you know this is not a new new thing that\nYou're just getting more and more vicious yeah [noise]\nI don't know her aides say earlier but do you agree I'll just restate it briefly when someone asked me is this really worse\nThan what was done to Robert Bork yes yes and yes\nThey went after Robert Bork for you know his philosophy in his ideology and they distorted that they didn't go after him personally\nTo attack him in such a way that put it this way it would be easy for him he didn't have young children his children were grown but if he did have young children at the time it would be easy to go home and said Ted Kennedy miss portrays\nAnd misconstrued my views on roe versus Wade that's entirely different than having to go home until you're ten year old daughter that you've been accused of gang rape\nExactly I mean they they got you know I I I always low when people start\nYou know check Kennedy the line and he said he was the hero of Chappaquiddick\nThat is true title\nIs is true colors came out and not one moment in his life\nAnd for him to be ... and ...\nOr do is go\nWho sat on the Senate Judiciary committee\nExactly exactly who made\nSandwiches with another senator\nChris Dodd looks name names\nYep so um [noise]\nYou know I found Rachel when she was doing I was watching Fox News\nI think it was\nA brash was holding a panel was on the panel\nAnd Chris adult a couple of other people and they were going after ... ... and this woman yeah yeah I was saying to my wife she is studying this woman up for something yeah\nAnd I wonder if she didn't have any knowledge of the allegations\nShe had to coach someone\nShe had two of she had two of you that it was a it was it was interesting\nThe most brilliant prosecutorial my history\nYeah yeah or something flagged in her mind about someone who would have said beforehand that they've had no yeah absolutely right bill absolutely right [laughter] you know but it's this story this part of the story may be the unraveling of all of Christine Ford's witness by the way\nI mean if you have the I interviewed this exploit that it's in their notes I made him credible you will mhm\nWhen this whole thing came out\nHere now are soaking he is now spoken under pain of a you know paying a penalty to the ... to the United states and that he has sent a letter to the Senate it is a crime to live in the United States Senate\nExactly and going forward the allegations first came out I said you know we have to understand is this is a democratic operatives\nMaking these claims\nPlain and simple things up you didn't know\nWhat I'm saying is that she's a democratic operative\nAnd why don't we know about the Democrats\nAnything go anything goes any\nAny any any slander that they can put together\nIs perfectly OK because as Cory Booker says the white is evil\nHad a question Dr Ford last week I just wanted to read some of them because we've heard that she ... she published her conclusions I don't know if you've all heard them\nUh and I don't think you should discount the letter sent to the Judiciary Committee by um doctor Ford's ex boyfriend this was her boyfriend in the nineties for I guess off and on six years in the nineties which would have been the decade following\nHer ... her her alleged sexual abuse he says she never once mentioned it never came up he had no idea of it among other things\nAmong other things he said that contradict everything not everything that contradict many things she said to the Senate Judiciary committee last week\nOr so anyway Rachel Mitchell she wrote that Dr Ford is not offered a consistent accountable and the alleged assault happens in July six text the Washington Post she said it happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nAnd her July thirtieth letter to Senator Feinstein she said it happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nHer August seventh statement to the polygraph or said that it happened one high school summer in the early Nineteen eighties ... crossed off to work early for reasons she does not explain\nA September sixteenth Washington Post article reported that Dr Ford set of happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty two\nSimilarly the September sixteenth article reported that notes from an individual therapy session and twenty Thirteen showed her describing the assault as the current the assault that's occurring when she was in her late teens\nBut she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen when the assault allegedly occurred she has not turned over her therapy records for the committee to review\nWhile it is common for victims to be uncertain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season and a particular year that's interesting isn't it\n[noise]\nRitual Mitchell also writes the doctor Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name until recently\nShe writes NO NAME was given and her twenty twelve marriage therapy notes she writes NO NAME was given an or twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes she writes the doctor Ford's husband claims to recall that she identified ... jet judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve\nAt that point judge Kavanaugh on his name was widely reported in the process of potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election in any event it took Dr Ford over Thirty years to name her assailant delayed disclosure of abuse is common\nSo this is not dispositive but when speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific\nDr Ford testified that she had told her husband about a sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she didn't foreign ... her husband she was the victim of physical abuse at the beginning of her marriage she testified that both times she was referring to the same incident\nDoctor for does not remember who invited her to the party or how she heard about it she does not remember how she got to the party she does not remembering what House the assault allegedly took place or where the house was located with any specificity perhaps most importantly she does not remember how she got from the party\nBack to her house on and on she goes it's worth reading folks ah it's worth reading and the reason I bring it up\nIf you want support for Brett Kavanaugh hit sixty percent pointed me now to reshape the Harris Poll has said he would do is

care had some a wonderful a veterans to take care of I'm always just you know\nThe best part of my week I Would say I like taking care of patients because when you get into this political business that's the only time in my week where people mean what they say and they say with me [laughter] if the nurse tells me that patients on the table the patient is just on\nThe table that's all I'm reminded of when Ronald Reagan was shot you know he had all those funny lines there was a terrible day obviously but he he maintain that sense of humor you remember he looked up to his doctor any hope you're a Republican I wouldn't have to ask but of\nUs [laughter] I was that the president but that is something\nAbout you walk the walk as well as talk the talk that I've I've liked to speak about and talking about your candidacy with others\nThat's right you're already twenty thousand in the whole basically before you get what you paid for\n... see I don't really have insurance at best you have a catastrophic plan that you're paying Cadillac plan rates for so it's really and and this is one of the fundamental places people get things wrong like Greg stand when they talk about\nHow many people would have or have not insurance and where they get their own his insurance and I know your listeners know this because there's a lot of them out there that field is having an insurance card in your wallet does not mean you have access\nTo such a huge him hugely important point I Love hearing you on us completely\nThe wrong metric the metric that we need to be talking about his can you see a doctor right not do you have an insurance card in your wallet for I have a gym card in my wallet\nBut as you can attest to see me and fortunately the fate of listeners can you know that that Jim cards not doing me a lot of wood and but I get so yeah it's we have to go and actually\nFollow through on things so you know one of the things to what my plan does that puts patients first it's a demand driven model instead of supply driven model every health care reform plan it again\nAnd you know fair and balanced the Republican or the Democrat plan our supply side driven their insurers are hospitals health care systems farm\nBut what we have to do is talk about providing a product and that's why in my plan you don't need an individual mandate because here's something that we cherish which is if you sell a product that has value to people that is worth something in their life\nThey will buy it of course in a few mandate things than what that does is it automatically makes the value of it less because you know if the coffee shop open around the corner and people were mandated to go there how do you think that coffee would\nBe oh gosh we go through this with our cable experience we go through this with all kinds of experiences we all know this intuitively absolutely\nSo my plan reforms the insurance system so that a person kids solves the portability problem you can have insurance just like you have insurance for your automobile your home whatnot you can get it early on you have low rates that\nThat worked for you at that phase of your life and you stick with that plan just like you do I've had usa since I joined the navy in Nineteen Ninety One I still have that same plans as my life changes throughout all the many things that have gone on ... lived around the world started a family kids are almost grown\nEvery time something changes I called my ensure chain you know update my plan\nAnd and that works really well for people people are used to it and I can you know it's portable and affordable\nNumber two is we need to strengthen Medicaid\nYou know the other side they're sending out Miller saying I'm trying to dismantle Medicaid which is obviously a complete lie and I work at the safety of Arizona's principles safety net hospital I actually what am I doing for Medicaid I'm actually taking care of those patients you know whether you get paid or not I take care of those patients concern right thing to do and what we need to do is make sure that system is there for people that\nIt continues to exist there are Seventy five million Americans on Medicaid right now when when the Medicaid expansion occurred what we did was we diluted and we we can to an already struggling\nHealthcare insurance program I Want to make sure that that safety net is strong for the people who need it the most vulnerable amongst us and I think the best way to do that just to give\nThe resources to the state because the state knows the best way to take care of their unique population just like with education just like we don't want the federal government telling us how to educate our children\nWe don't want the federal government telling us how to provide health care for the most vulnerable in our communities here in Arizona we have vast rural areas we have ... Native American populations that are frequently medicate dependent and\nWe cannot because of the rules and the regulations that are top down coming from Washington DC we cannot deliver those services efficiently\nThroughout a state like ours now if you're in Massachusetts or Vermont maybe have different challenges great let them you know take care of their population and their own way we'll take care of ours in our own way we will do it much more efficiently that takes moral hazard out of it\nAnd then because Medicaid is our number to budget line item do we have education and Medicaid when we save that money by delivering our health care more efficiently and higher quality\nIt actually freeze up more money for us to put towards educating our kids perfect and so it's a win win and we have a healthy and an educated society\nPerfect this is a mind to live folks there is no substitute for brands as you can tell Jordan is in Phoenix I I put you on with Dr for our\nFirst Jordan I I'm actually from Tempe but uh\nUm we we got we got a mailer from you and I do think will ... will most likely be voting for you I'm well thank God I just the mail or that you know extra broken system", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Seth Leibsohn Show", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "03"}
