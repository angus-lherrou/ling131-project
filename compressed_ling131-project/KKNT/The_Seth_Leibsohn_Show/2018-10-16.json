opposed to\nAudit ... that that that's so important and so true Michael but how do you know that what she says today isn't based on on the views that she has maintained up until yesterday [noise] um I mean a\nHas she said anything I I mean I Would like her to denounce what she said about the Taliban I'd like\nTo hear how she does it how do you in at the age of twenty five I think she was twenty five it's somehow at the age of twenty five in the midst of this war\nTo get away with saying it's just fine to support the Taliban while you are an advocate of course\nFor women's rights of let me come back to on this and we're going to a break Michael don't go away we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n\nI Can't believe the holidays are almost here again world that's not all\nThe time to review

Scottsdale about whether it's fair to hold Kirsten sentiments comments about the Taliban and two thousand three\nAgainst her I'm Michael I you know I I just disagree when when we think about that she was I looked up the math by the way she was twenty seven at the time\nOr should run for office the year before and I think when you're talking about you know it being okay or just fun if you want to join the Taliban are in the middle of that war um that at twenty seven and you're already I'm running\n[noise]\nFrom policy to culture principles to fall asleep [noise] this is the leaves and show [noise]\nBack to the ... leads to show I Am ... six zero to fives zero eight zero nine six zero\nUh you know who else isn't buying a Elizabeth Warren's a DNA claim of her strong evidence of Native American ancestry\nOr the Cherokee Nation they just put out a statement saying a DNA test is useless to determine troubled citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors\nWere in digital to North or South America sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and well DNA tests can be used determine lineage\nSuch a paternity to an individual is not evidence of any affiliation using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate\nAnd wrong and it makes a mockery out of DNA tests so not even the Cherokee Nation is buying this a as usual\nJohn hinder arc or had a pretty smart point on this uh one that uh uh makes total sense or he writes warrants defense of her claim to being Native American is good for America because if Warren is an Indian\nAnd then so or the rest of us and most of us are also African American or Hispanic\nBy her definitions if everyone is an Indian then obviously no one is the logic is said to the whole corrupt affirmative action enterprise\nHarvard law school built Elizabeth Warren is the first woman of color on its faculty on the contrary to foreign one one thousand to Native American ancestry counts\nThe law school has probably had any number of women of color both before her an after her most of us would qualify\nAffirmative action is teetering on the brink trial of the Asian students race discrimination lawsuit against Harvard University began today Harvard's denial that it discriminates against Asian applicants is transparently false\nAt the academic world has rallied around the university and we're likely will prove to be a vein effort to uphold the discriminatory regime in which nearly all are complicit\nRight right right we want to get beyond race we have to get beyond race I think these\nAre the use of race or ethnicity in admissions is is is is the legacy of of of an era I I I Wish we regretted\nThirty forty and fifty years ago you cannot convey a benefit to someone based on their race or ethnicity without taking a benefit from someone based on their race or ethnicity race either matters or doesn't\nAnd in this country I was taught it shouldn't Mike is in Phoenix welcome to the show Mike\n... thanks for taking my call um\nKind of chemical that was going to say a in a way I just wanted to remind everybody that\nI'm a loser the foreign I eat honest uh the issue is not that she is or is not an ... a Native American um she went to Harvard law using the benefits\nThat that's a big point I mean I was able to understand whether she took advantage of that heritage fake though I think it is um ... yeah I think\nThey're trying to change it on her side yes just to say oh well\nShe is an Indian or she is not an Indian and and that's not even the issue they're trying to change the issue now in the in the in the political arena\nAnd her her DNA test they even said that it was she was European she wasn't even I mean you know she's like one billion you know Native American so she\nWent to Ghana ... based on this yes what advantages and like I went\nAnd I and I uh was able to get into Harvard or ... and mark that I was Native American right that I was black right and that's what she did and and she's not [laughter]\nNo I I I mean that's right and and you know I I I guess uh you know maybe maybe we need to go back to the Blumenthal rule ... if you lie and one thing do lie and all maybe someone on asking that question\nThere you go thank you my ... you bet thank you uh who's next duty tedious ...\nIt was going to say I did it that's all right you can say [laughter] I\nI'm I just got excited listening to Michael Scottsdale yeah but I'm not gonna take a side I Need a fight\nI wouldn't call it an F. Y. I. alert uh-huh hey Michael backed tail okay uh you know what I'm going to do this evening at six o'clock\nYou can watch a debate that's good\nI'm going to watch the debate between next belly and then at la mhm it is a point on at six o'clock this yes however stuff you know I don't know if they're going to take calls from voted I don't know if they do that\nI don't think they do not I haven't seen them yet I haven't seen them I've watched a lot of these debates I haven't seen that yet I kinda regret their only doing one debate by the way\nYeah you have to wonder why\nWell I think it's because the candidates have wanted such a um I'm\nAn air campaign rather than a ground campaign I think they want and not be held to account previous statements\nYeah I I look at it as an entity that's an epidemic strategy I backed by\nA little bit I mean but but you know I I think mostly they don't want to be asked a lot of hard questions and there are a lot of hard question what I'm\nHoping my hope yeah I'm going to happen like belly will have the guts to ask\nAbout the Taliban\nAnd I'm hoping she willing if not that a moderator will I think it is an incredible statement I mean I take Michael's point on that and generally we\nYou know don't hold someone's useful views against them especially if they've evolved\nBut if you have such an extreme view at the age of twenty seven again a year after you first ran for office you're already declaring yourself part of the political process your adult enough to do that\n[noise] um ...\nThat's an awfully extreme view to have about the Taliban awfully extreme doesn't even begin to cut it if you've had a conversion um it's odd that you would convert to the Democratic party\nWell you know what that actually I Am not take it I didn't do well not right yeah\nI'm On either one I I Am going to watch the program and um maybe Google 'em all the information that you that you read rather um so that's what I'm getting\nSo what do you do me a favor to call us tomorrow and give us your ah your ah your analysis of what took place at the debate I Would love that I Would love actually and and I would invite all of our listeners ... and you know we call this a seminar sometimes there's homework [laughter]\nI Would I Would love to have people now very interviews of it I Would love people to do because you're right though\nDidi it is a race that has been in its own ways somewhat stealthy it's it's been a race that has not\nAsked a lot of tough questions of the candidates who have not made themselves available for a lot of the tough questions\nAnd I just think that's to our detriment again politics letter rip you know if you're if you're if you're adult enough to run for such an important seat as you say that if the United states senator for that matter Congress as as they have and has as they both are congresswoman or Congress Congress persons at this point\nUm you should be big enough to be able to defend your record and talk about you know any changes you've had in the evolution you pat I'm all for evolution so I I have no problem with it I you know I Would not want to be held desires and Michael have pointed out to the standards of ah my ideology when I was a freshman\nOr for that matter ... believe in a sophomore in college\nBut then again I was Nineteen and twenty I wasn't twenty seven and running for office either a Doug is in Maricopa Hi Doug\n\nBrushed off color and what are you painting or you're painting a picture of me or something what do you painting\nA say in the landscape and a dessert but\nI Want to I I Want to do a really just I had three things I wanted to talk about but I wanted to complain this has happened to me once again in our marriage for years I used to\nTell my wife that uh you know if she ever left me I'd go with her okay well then told totally totally cave came out with that song and my wife has held that against the all these years that we could have got rich if I had written a song with my life\n[laughter]\nBonded are married forty two year marriage today and uh you know I was I was basically all day long I've been saying if she's a Native American we're all Native American uh-huh\nAnd and so the whole point of this is just absolutely ridiculous that you can be one one thousand and one of the things I learned way way back in college back when they had a horse cart\nRight yeah that's right with it my wife's not there I have to call her up and ask her what the other half my\nBread [laughter] and I don't know when you\nWhen you find out that when you're with your partner doing nothing is a greater joy there and doing great things by yourself you know then you know you're going to be happy\nAnd that and that's a great rule that's a great role um the key to all this she writes faith gratitude grace commitment love and surrender as you said\nGratitude for the simple things you know and I think gratitude explains happiness in general\nYeah you know almost all\nThe ...\n... and now that we got off of that I'll get my my what I was thinking about what my comment\nBecause the photos that show yeah that that other crime\nIt's been a you could give it to me give it to me real quick on Mike\nOkay ah he's totally missing the difference between being accused in high school\nHaving totally idiotic opinions as a twenty seven year old I Would say this we have to hold each other's accountable for the past but it has to be a truthful path you can't just make an accusation in the ... compare that to an idiotic statement I'd been held accountable for an idiotic statement I may Fifteen Years ago\nAnd I said I Would come out and say well that was totally stupid yeah and I shouldn't have said that you know it if I did I don't remember saying to\nHave her come out and say that this is Jane Fonda was only a very young lady when she sat with the north Korea North a Vietnamese right one of the most violent things if she came out and said that was probably one of the most horrific things ever did okay that's different\nBut you can't say well she did it when she was young\nOkay man sitting murdered people and he was young that doesn't take away from the how stupid there was people have to show an advancement in part\nChange of thought and and if she does think it was reprehensible why you know ever come out and talk about terrorism and how hard fought center or the ... she can stay that cause then she will have to above all towards our side\nFor sure I yeah I I I it's hard to put this into into words but if you had a sincere conversion from\nThat kind of far left thinking and that is far left thinking the Democratic party isn't where you would convert to just isn't\nThat just it it well then if you if you if you're changed much since you were a democratic activists why\nOur ... in fairness to her I think she was a bit of speaking on behalf of the Green Party at the time but if you convert away from crazy left in some you don't usually joined them\nThat you don't you like\nI can attend Seth and ... we might just three and this that the Democratic party has moved eighty percent to where the green\nParty don't read I don't disagree that is the Democratic party as a left wing a outfit total Hugo unholy thank you ... you write a okay fine we'll call this a marriage our cameras in Chandler might you know\nHey how are you like the marriage is a great thing it should get more than an hour quite frankly\nI could not believe that I have to tell you that the secret sauce from what I've been told to be made by my dad

actually a short maybe to think it's only an hour to walk\nVery glad that it's getting a much more attention and many more viewers than um than the Fahrenheit movie by Michael Moore that that is a

be a good a\nStreet gr too long marriage murdered my spam warmer for about two years oh okay and you know\nEarly on uh when we were still really when\nWe got a good ... from um\nI'm an older brand new

the way I have a I have\nNoted that I'm In in in ... ... you know that that which um is is too easily are able to be and that is that which which which you don't ... well that which you can dispose of too easily will be more easily disposed of\n'em and that yeah I Do think not not in every case of course there are good reasons sometimes for these things um but in a lot of cases in too many cases it really does come down\nTo um you know\nA selfishness that that no longer understands that there are two people making one unit [noise] um I I'm I have a noted a study before it's it's some years old now but I think it's still abides and I'll get the years off a little bit but I think you'll understand the essence\nThat couples that were contemplating divorce who's duck with the marriage who stuck with it or something like\nFive to eight years later I I can get the exact study but something like five to eight years later they the divorce was the furthest thing from their mind if they you know the stick to it of ... um the importance of that the importance of recognizing\nThat gratitude has to abide by the importance of recognizing the selfishness\nUm and self and I asked a really yield to we um you know there there's a lot to that um and and and and I think that's what a lot of people are worried about when no fault divorce became the norm\nAnd of course ... became too much\nOf the norm I still like the principle of I'm a true love being too imperfect souls\nWho refused to give up on each other but yeah I I think you've hit it I think you've hit it pretty good Dan pretty good

office a topic that should be pertinent to any debate for federal office a topic that I'm the moderators did not raise\nTheir didn't raise them I think deliberately they didn't raise them for one reason being that they are in congresswoman ... I'm Martha McSally is we'll house letters to say\nA national defense national security and military issues there was no question incredible\nUm this is you know one of her\nGreat calling card just as a big huge part of her resume and they didn't ask a simple question about it I think that was a deliberate I think it was also delivered in that they know\nA ... cinemas extremely vulnerable on those very issues Anthony focus with me on one sec if you will because I Want to play the audio whiff of Martha McSally if you don't mind a all credit to her\nFor when she was given her last question of the evening on water policy about which I maintain is yes extremely important\nBut also probably constitutions zero percent of those watching last night's interest I don't think anyone tuned in last night to see their differences on water policy if I'm wrong I Apologize I just that's just my sense\nUm and I think they did it to run the clock down so they didn't have to get to a national security so ah bless 'em mix Sally or at least a kudos to mix selling for ... the way she did here's how she did it\nTo be able to move forward to addressing is really important issues but we have to talk about the military we are to talk about our veterans quickly please we haven't had any opportunity you have a right now and that's what brought me to Arizona like five hundred thousand of our veterans for our national security measures that are here\nI thought for to make sure that the eight ten was preserved and that we fight for Luke air force base my opponent advocate into the shutdown Luke air force base well we're in harm's way\nShe protesting our troops and I think two two and I tell you what if they are not just qualifying enough\nChairs in what came out last week CNN reported that in two thousand three well she was on the radio he said it was okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban to fight or were they were at a time we have to look at our wedding we apologize to the veterans me for saying it's running out of time so we got to get a response we are we five because she was outside of holiday is\nTell Martha has chosen to run a campaign like the one you're seeing right now\nAnd then go ahead and give us the rest of that\nResponse in Arizona our lifeline but I worked for Senator Jon Kyl\nAnd not share the fellow pitcher but the truth I said I've always thought for Arizona and I had been proud to serve our state in elected office for over Thirteen on answer Arizona's down me and they now my record that I wasn't on ... for them\nIs trying to make the Senate campaign about me but what we know is that this campaign is about everyday Arizona and and I'll Fight for them\nWe have to stop it we have to stop it right there we got to stop and\nShe was asked after the debate about the Taliban comments and she uh dodged than as well\nAnd uh no I'm Sorry yes or no I'm Sorry there is a record and uh that uh miss a congresswoman cinema has been running from has been dodging and I think of to the degree\nThat uh she doesn't want to submit herself to the media or the press that is of course her choice I don't know why the media or the press gives her a pass on it they should not\nIt is a dramatically shocking statement to say in two thousand three at the age of twenty seven after you have already run for office that it is just fine with you if someone joins the Taliban up people ten years younger\nOr two days sitting in prison\nFor having joined and fought for the most retro grade regime I can possibly think of or that modern history has ever seen joining and fighting for the Taliban six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero your reactions to the debate Patrick is in Scottsdale Hi Patrick\nI'm well how are you\nVery much for the writer for Barry Goldwater but which just means that operate in a reason to not most okay and uh I was watching the debate last night and\nI was struck with what I call the ...\nOkay she looks like Barbie doll\nYesterday nothing directly or specifically in the ... and you know if you look at her she is she is\nTotally do anything but a patriotic\nCitizen and I'm not talking about I I'm not I'm not a far right military but I I think part of the country and I go to understand\nRunning for public office particularly federal office\nWho doesn't take pride in the country and who would do what she did with regard to demonstrations against the military et cetera I\nIt's the demonstrations against the military it's saying it's just fine to joined the Taliban she said she had a record well that's the wrong way and we're asking her out and Patrick I'm a ... a ... you're absolutely right about the\nDodging and weaving I Hope I Hope everyone saw how much of it there was did you see how long it took her not to answer the question about Brett Kavanaugh\nI mean they have they let her go on and on and on not answering the question thank goodness they followed up and pressed her on it and she finally meander her way in a way ending and fractious answer of no all the while saying\nThat she voted no because he lied to the Senate there is no credible proof whatsoever that he lied to the Senate Judiciary committee I mean what's\nIn the dodge itself was a lie I think\nI honestly think Patrick a\nAnd I don't want this to be any excuse for people not to vote or to or to take anything for granted I honestly think Mick Sally is going to win and buy bigger numbers than the polls are right now showing\nI also think that the Democratic party has buyer's remorse with her because I think they were a little bit afraid that some of this would come up I don't think they had any idea the enormity of how much and how bad it\nHas come up would come up whether it's calling Arizona the mess slab of democracy whether it's her statements about the crazies in Arizona while out of state or now most recently this uh this statement about uh it's just fine with her people joined the Taliban I don't think they had any idea that was in the record\nI don't even know if ah in contemplating her run for Senate Kirsten Sinema even remember saying those things and the reason I don't know if she remembered seeing them or not is because she probably didn't think they were a big deal and that it was just all very cute and fun and funny\nI think they're I think they have buyer's remorse about her and I think they have it about David Garcia running for governor\nAgree I totally agree it shows you go ahead go ahead\nYeah I I just uh I was struck with you know I mean the image in the body language by first set of expressed an arrogance at ... ... it was coupled with the corporate ability for any substantial ... any question plus the fact\nThe moderators I felt from the beginning or a hostile towards a more so in extremely accommodating toward a spin that came across\nI Do too and you know we have sat here say here is that the right temps we have sat here to several debate moderated by Ted Simons of PBS of our local affiliate a PBS of doing the exact same thing this guy is is is is not a I don't think very good moderator I think he is extra\nA extra hard and the biased shows in the interest to seize as I said which is to say in the follow ups in who he presses on what\nI'm at the idea that these two are only going to have one debate is sad enough\nBut the idea that she could get away with it I think any objective watcher last night of saying so much of nothing for so long is is is really is is really probably surprising to her I'm betting she was surprised with how easy it was for her to do that\nI was amazed that that actually out she I mean I I was so angry at those moderators for not getting her what questions that we're going to go through the issue and and I thought to myself at first but what are you doing you're getting into this like the leftist\nBut she thought she did very very well\nHey what's up buddy I'm On a couple of things I Want you to do before I get to my point on we never found out which\nPolls were closed last primary from that we usually guy and then\nA dream sponsors proposition Adrian foreigners trustworthy yeah yeah okay go over the propositions\nWeather's ahead of time on the radio and break him down and kind of if you can\nJoin yeah I've done well yeah I don't know if you heard me a little bit on them in the last hour but uh I did it\nOn for oh no where is all ah I'll I'll do a reprise in a few moments if\nYou weren't you guys put up your website or Facebook page or you could just go and kind of digest they got along the shirt you know some people who may miss\nTwo main ones by the way the ... there's two big okay that lend themselves to I'm a serious a serious implications ideologically as well as economically uh one of them is a thrill five which expands or educational choice which which we support\nThe other big he is one twenty seven which is funded by Tom Sawyer from California which we aren't Lee oppose\nI'm as yeah that's where the other um I think three I'm I'm recommending people go to ... about ... dot com\nBecause it does a nice break down of them and who supports them they don't give great idiot logical cleavages for example on prop one twenty six you will see it as opposed by both David Garcia and do see so they kind of play around on them are Janelle yeah but not so much to the heart of the ideological or issues though\nWhen I usually if I don't understand it if I don't understand and I just vote no fine like if I can if it doesn't it's not clear I'm just like no\nFine I'm again as you find I'm generally against the whole process that's we have it now anyway fine by me if you don't know I Would say no\nOr or ignore it yeah yeah yeah [noise]\nWell about the debate I watched the whole thing and what was shocking to me was a that gentleman I was like a a step further socialist she was a robotic gr answers were wrote shoes in motion lists every time she was asked but thank you for asking me that you know thank you for asking me that and I'm just like\nIt was so\nI don't want to shake coach but it was just bizarre I mean I I hadn't seen anything like it I did and I and I did say that next Sally took took command of it on the last question when she finally was like demanded they ask a serious question about the military um\nBecause basically it was just cinema lying over and over and over ... you know denying all these things that most people know about I go on her Facebook page and\nOr even a few Democrats more kind of upset with her Roach emotion lists answers and her demeanor\nOh I I think there's tremendous buyer's remorse in the Democratic party with her with her run for the Senate here [noise] um\nI think they thought she could come off\nAs a modern I think she has done a good job of dodging the tough questions I think the media has by and large done a terrible job of holding them to account by the way Eddie\nI'm a good friend of mine just emailed me\nA a really good breakdown of the state ballot initiatives can be found at the Arizona free enterprise club [noise] uh and you can go to their website they do a really nice
