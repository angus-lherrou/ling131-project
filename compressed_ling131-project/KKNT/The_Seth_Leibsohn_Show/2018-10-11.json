is six zero to five zero eight zero\nNine six zero our buddy ... park was asking me um why he doesn't see more uh campaigning from or more uh advertising and campaigning\nFrom uh the ... campaign or there's really two answers I have to that I think one of them is\nI I suppose it's where do you look or where do you watch I maybe maybe the channels maybe the times I have seen a lot of TV ads for Martha McSally it could be just the stations I'm watching but\nI have seen probably an equal number\nOf ads from curious in cinema a and her campaign\nThat having been said I'm as a as I was also saying neither of them are doing a lot of a public events uh this is a campaign that has been a little bit criticized for being mostly an air war as it is to say mostly an advertising campaign or\nIs there is a Republican put it uh I think not too terribly unfairly both candidates have limited their exposure to campaign events that does tell what they're talking points or feature them rowing supporters as much as\nPossible along with their political allies excel in\nCinema are counting on a multimillion dollar he the ad war to reach voters in shape the image\nThat will use to judge them\nIn one instance cinema literally bolted from a reporter to avoid an unscripted moment\nShe said she was simply late for an event um [noise]\nLast month hours after CNN ... talkative antiwar flyers from two thousand through the Democratic candidate spit out a back door of a democratic get out the vote event in Chandler avoiding in Arizona Republic reported there to ask for comment\nAbout the controversy cinema had shown up at the tail end of the event urged Democrats to unite behind her bid for the U.S Senate um\nThis this is a similar things have happened uh with with both can't candidates I guess they're they're just not doing\nA lot of public events uh and it's too bad I'm uh because uh [noise]\nBoy I I think we'd like it and we'd like it um [noise] it's good politics you know I just I like politics and I like the happy warrior and uh I Know one of them are and not the other but I I I like the happy warrior in politics I like the combat and competition of ideas\nI like us learning and persuading the debate and argument\nOr I don't think\nThat the debate structures that PBS has put together for most of these forums has been particularly great it's been a bit stunted I Believe\nUm and I don't think they've been actually very fair in the aggregate either a not to the Republican candidates anyway uh\nSo I I just wish there were more I Do wish there were more I feel I feel what you're saying Travis I hear what you're saying\nUm but this is evidently been strategy both candidates have adopted and accepted\nAnd um it's too bad it's just too bad I'm to the credit\nOf other candidates are they are demanding more debates asking for more debates\nUh I Know that's been true certainly of a gentleman I'm running for Congress here in district ... a friend of mine and soon studio with us about a week ago was knee see for our he's challenged gr extend to a number of debates particularly most recently I Believe on healthcare Stan is cut an ad on healthcare\nA for our would like to debate him on it tough for our um is a actually an expert on that I think it would be good for the public to see a competition of ideas about an issue uh the ranks

called a lot worse [laughter]\nLike yeah okay that's fair enough I I'd like to shoot a little higher than\nSomething that you know I've been called a lot worse but ... okay [laughter] it's just that\nIt it's amazing B a B connotations people what an artist the emotional basket case is\nA ... it's every demeaning and you can imagine a social demise triggered it to my by business you know and in many cases it's always do but not so in this case\nWhat is that quote oh there's a wonderful quote I had at the other day um about I Believe it's John Adams right about the reason he studied art do you know that quote\nThe science of government you know I don't like the science of why I hear it I I think I have it right yes I think\nThis is an accurate rendering the science of government it is my duty to study more than all the science says the arts of legislation\nAnd administration negotiation not to take the place if indeed exclude in a manner of all other arts I must study politics in more than our sons may have the ... liberty to study mathematics and philosophy our sons on to study mathematics and philosophy geography natural history and naval architecture navigation ...\nCommerce in agriculture\nIn order to give their children the right to study painting poetry music architects sure statuary tapestry of porcelain\nAbsolutely wonderful isn't that great he wrote that I was a I think he wrote that to his wife\nYeah wow that's pretty high brow\nWas pretty good and bad not bad [laughter] bad for our SARS that NPR does that leave me alone [laughter] I'm\nI I just thought my wife's instead of the weather\nYeah there yeah [laughter] yeah well I don't think it's about right into our wives there's talk to her why their girlfriends the way down Adams did Abigail but all of\nA sudden sound like a intellectual ...\nYeah yeah yeah spaghetti again [laughter]\n\nYou know you get a nominal I'm a point on other things as I'm getting totally going to a different direction than what I was calling about but\nUm if you look at some some of the civil war letters from all these people some painting the amount of soldiers a simple people on the front lines ooh cool all politically\nThey were just there were litter giants compared to today and they were just simple farmers a mid level supervisors and you know it's amazing the level of education but mixed in with that is a lot of drawing the head with those letters\nWell actually some old rocks or they could have been left yeah an eyebrow or today and I always think of art is one of those things ...\nCombining the left and the right side of the brain\nAnd really I wrote a great article um he basically said that everybody should be an artist and the steam creative energy is required to do a great masterpiece or art or say pushing paper in my case oil fate or is it needs to be an entrepreneur\nShould be up business entrepreneur is the same creative force in the same Korea too hot\nAnd so he's on if something big dog uh you know you think about it a lot of great treatise is have the word the art or the phrase the art of in front of him one thinks of the art of war of course one thinks of the art of politics the art of any number of things right yeah\nAbsolutely it's really fast um I think too often people's\nUm politicized well that's a great thing should be created it means in terms of spot whether it's engineering best leap then\nCreate a leap to watch it I said what many hours and got stuck and then they're just create a lease and understand that the creative process\nAbsolutely and I think good writers are all artists to yeah in me that William Buckley wasn't an artist with his pen yeah yeah\nTotally totally one hundred percent so well\nThat was fun aside yeah I like\nHer asides is a lot in them in wall we're\nWe're learning to study a very famous footnote in the case a footnote is more important than the case for no I think it's a footnote foreign the Carolyn products case it's any anyone who's been to law school will know what I'm Talking about but it's sometimes the footnotes are more important that's all I'm saying [laughter]\nYeah yeah and sometimes at best the most fun comes from totally impromptu totally unprepared for that but that she can help\nUh so do you in doubt fatherless miss you get more of it\nAnd all that in the face of every piece of research we know that show the importance of a father in the house All right so a lot of stress that there was a there was a um I I almost have to invoke it because I think it is so low but\nUh uh uh Anthony what is the what's the name of that or social Baron Cohen series where he plays someone else what what's his character where he plays a reporter and he gets these interviews\nIn something like that he he he plays a fake reporter fake interviewer and yeah and at one point a few years ago he was interviewing Newt Gingrich and I have no idea how these people you know Paul for his his his deception\nAnd he was talking to Newt Gingrich about welfare reform and Newt Gingrich was talking about the benefits of welfare reform and how you know to reduce welfare rules by fifty percent\nAnd a saucer Baron Cohen was making the ridiculous point I'm\nWell that's not a good thing isn't it a wouldn't you wouldn't you want more of it wouldn't success be more people on welfare and knew didn't know how to deal with that but the logical point we would have made was well yeah that is the Democratic prescription of course the more dependent on government the more you're going to support government and the party of bigger government right\nThat's all the prelude mentality\nJob you know I I think it's really important is this thing about how energized if you feel like everything is hope\nYou have no power hopelessness comes when you feel there are no options and there you have no power that's right do or not personally motivated\nTo attack the problem you're not energized to try to take a chance to do anything and so in in that hopelessness as a weapon that the liberals use 'em there there's a great story in the early seventies when uh we were moving out of Vietnam\nUh we had a we had\nPeople

Arizona proposition three o five it's known as the expansion of empowerment scholarship accounts referendum that's a mouthful to do so one of my favorite education analysts in the country he is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation as well as the Goldwater Institute Jonathan butcher walking back Jonathan\nGreat to be with you\nThank you thank you or talk to us a little bit about three or five first of all it's it's kinda complicated on how it got on the ballot and I and I think you kinda\nTo discuss the real five you kind of got to know how that happened before we get to the ultimate points of three or five if you want to give us a little biography of three oh far if you if you don't mind\nShores do last year\nLawmakers voted to expand Arizona's empowerment scholarship account\nUm they're also called education savings account or a law now in six states around the U. S. Arizona was the first and really broke new grounds with this really creative learning option what happens with an education savings account or Arizona ES days is that the state topography portion of a child on\nFrom the state funding formula\nAnd in a private account that parents then use for educational products and services\nNow the program has long been available to families of children with special needs\nAs well as children adopted from the foster care system uh children a military family uh and and children from a persistently low performing school of a variety I think of\nStudents to come from challenging situation and so over time lawmakers had expanded the program brought additional students and I think to give them new opportunities because we thought that these accounts were flexible they could be used for a lot of different things\nAnd families with children with special needs in particular we're having a lot of success with them\nThat could be used for anything from tuition to a supplemental education services to a ... and basically the was the range the warp and woof of things anything having to do with basically your elementary and secondary education well elementary segregation primarily now perhaps expanded the secondary yeah\nSure so exactly so that that's really what's decorated the USA's burn anything that have come before it's more than just a scholarship to a private school right you can hire a personal tutor or you can find an educational therapist you could save for college\nYou could even pay college tuition and you could pay for textbooks or at the elementary high school college level et cetera so it it was a way to even customize a child's learning experience if\nA if a family chose to you didn't have to write him and you can use it just a private school but but just that very capability made it something that was extremely I think unique and help those families that have children with\nA pretty unique neat so that's that's what was so powerful about this new change so last year the last year or the the program or a six year of operation and lawmakers voted to extend the program\nOver time to allow students from all grade level in\nA traditional public school to if they chose moved from a traditional public school they're assigned score charter schools to an education savings account\nAnd so what they would do if they would phase in certain grade levels over the course of four years so it would no longer be exclusively for students that had um you know uniquely door for students from the foster adopted from foster care system et cetera right now it would be\nEvery child in Arizona would have the same great learning option\nAgain this is the family's opt in if they chose chose to use the so lawmakers voted for that a following following the vote\nOf ... there was opposition I always from the state teachers' union as well as a state school board association and I think what's critical to remember is that shortly after education savings accounts became law in two thousand eleven\nThe teachers' union and their allies school board association others\nFiled a lawsuit to take these accounts away from children with special needs ... that's what they tried to do starting in two thousand eleven and they lost to a lawsuit a and conversely families that desperately needed great option one\nAnd so now that the program continues to succeed and to grow the union and our allies thought okay well what's the next thing you know what the next way to go about I'm stumbling block it out there running around you\nAnd so they uh they went after this ballot initiative and so they they now have put on about what we know of proposition grill thought\nSo if you vote yes for three or four that means what if you\nOh no for three or five that means what\nSure yes on three or five would mean that the bill that passed last year would go into effect and if you know the bill that passed last year would not go into effect I think a a an important thing to remember is that the program it though\nOutside of the expansion that passed last year that is safe and in in law are as of today so that that will not be affected or children with with special needs an existing students are and even continued growth with those population\nHowever um they these union and their allies would be saying there will be no um advance men or innovation or by way of education savings accounts um\nTrue you know through in the future they they will or if they if they're even though I'm thrilled by they will effectively say um you know we're going to make it for the students either have to attend their zone public school or they will have fewer option\nTo expand school choice you would generally support three o five proposition three o five is expands ... educational savings account\nThat's correct now some of the criticisms uh we're talking to Jonathan butcher from the Heritage Foundation and the Goldwater Institute some of the criticisms Jonathan or I'd like to throw your way\nOpponents of three or five say this expansion Rob ... money from traditional public schools\n[noise]\nSo the when the bill that expanded the program last year was going through the legislature the state legislative analysts reviewed how the funding formula works to\nPay for education things accountants or to make a program operational and they found that children with special needs who choose to use an education savings account\nActually save the state about fourteen hundred dollars per child right he stayed with state fourteen hundred dollars per child and critical thing to remember that right now again because of the limited eligibility for ... days as we know it today about half of the children\nAre using education things accounts are children with special needs and that's based on the latest numbers that I think the department or was releasing I Love about last year or perhaps even um\n... animal right or right and that's the important thing to note about this education savings account or ... ... ... formula isn't it that the money a lot of to go into it on a per pupil basis\nIs less than the money that would otherwise go in and a lot to the student if he were to maintain the traditional public school correct\nAbsolutely so children with special needs receive about Ninety percent\nOf what would otherwise be available to them in the traditional public school systems there isn't a an additional amount\nAdded to them or some complications in there about about how it's funded but but the fact is that when you look at a traditional student or even a student with special needs who attends a traditional public school there is state money\nWhich is about forty to forty five percent their local money which is about forty to forty five percent of that total and then there is federal money you're talking about another\nTen percent of American Idol right\nMhm sure depending on all of the other various components with an education savings account you're talking about the state portion alone right so you know we're staying forty you're immediately you're lumping\nAll approximately of what the other funding sources or you know maybe\nWell done Jonathan or if you had to wear the devil's advocate cap for a second or what would be why would anyone want to oppose this sounds like a win win for families in a win win for budget\nSure I mean I think it's it's certainly a win win for children that have a\nYou know that have very unique needs and that you know the the traditional public school system has has come they have tried for many years to help children with us Stay Down syndrome or with um who are on the autism spectrum for example and ah they're even ways\nUnder do federal law where the public system can actually placed a child with special lead in a private school already mhm\nUh the process of doing that is not always easy yeah it's also not always um [noise] there are several steps involved right to\nDoing that with an education savings account I think it ... it makes it puts the decision making forty and the parents have to say hey look I signed on with us from my childhood I I Need to take out so\nPlease I Hope is does not go unnoticed this may be the most important issue of our age really must it might be it really might be a you want to hear a little bit about Kanye West you want to hear a little bit about what it means when negroes don't read\nAll right here's Kanye West\nField people say you're black you haven't been Democrats have a a I have a conversation that basically\nSays that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it is a limit to a lot of jobs are so that was the fathers
