I Love would love to take the opportunity you've done it on the show before but as you know um repetition repetition is the essence of pedagogy I Wonder if she wouldn't mind telling us how you know you and I\nA lot of others you know the Claremont Institute note to be a a a distinctive on a different kind of think tank uh especially in the in the conservative constellation I Wonder if you might say a few words about what the Claremont Institute\nDoes but why the Claremont Institute is\nShort and I'm happy to well we um we were founded forty years ago next year actually and we'll be celebrating our fortieth anniversary next year I'm to restore the principles of American founding to the preeminent place in our national life\nAnd we thought the best way to go about that um [noise] was to engage the realm of ideas rather than the day to day a policy battles policies important of course but we thought that a policy ultimately it was\nA downstream from the intellectual fights and the battle of ideas that's waged you know in books I'm In\nVarious uh public prints and that sort of thing we we uh run a series of educational foul ships that like to give people a crash course and how to think about the American founding and progressive as him and then our modern fights today or in a principled way I Would give them a training and learning that they missed in college or in law school\nOr that we've published at Claremont review of books and Johnny's my colleague John who's been runs our Center for constitutional jurisprudence in which we try to bring the courts back to first principles both in brief writing and and the occasional direct representation case\nSo I'd like to say that we are we educate rewrite and we let a gate although that's that's my that's my elevator pitch\nAnd yeah I Know I like I like that that's really good and names that people might be familiar with that have some that have attachments to work ... from the Claremont Institute some of the wonderful things you've sent out into the world\nDo include a such scholars as Michael Anton uh Larry are hardly a isn't is the name the heart of hearts that hardly anyone who listens to the station wouldn't know he is the former president and one of the founders of Claremont Institute\nA you had mentioned John Eastman who is as well known to many in our audience\nA there are others um it would also be fair to say would it not\nRyan that the intellectual founder of the Claremont Institute was a former professor of ours uh Harry Jaffe someone I mentioned on the show frequently um he he was the intellectual found her in\nIn the sense that his students basically Larry ... and his generation of students ... co founded the Institute together fair enough [noise]\nYes yes probably fair enough it was all a area would have been a hundred years old this October so uh at the end of the month for gathering with some of our seven hundred alumni members not we don't have that many there at a retreat in Washington to reflect on some of the various political writing and writing about conservatism as well so I should be fun\nAnd he'd hate it cut out the flag and criticize everything that would be said there\nYeah [laughter] that's Buckley is famous line about Harry right or if you think it's hard disagreements I'm try agreeing with them [laughter] examines every argument as if it's a contract with the Soviet Union\nI remember a D.C panel dedicated to 'em when Harry was alive and there was a panel are you guys did in D. C.\nUm where you were talking about Harry Jaffe his work and Charles Kessler who's affiliated obviously with the Institute and the editor of this the review of books they're\nA he was moderating the panel and doing an introduction and\nIt was kind of a funny thing Harry was in the audience and while the panel was up there talking about him and I ...\nI went up to Charles afterwards I said so reminds me of anti hall you know where the guys talking about Marshall McLuhan Woody Allen just drags out Marshall McLuhan yeah so you guys know nothing of my work you understand me not at all [laughter]\nIt was much much like that we can talk\nMore about Harry a little later um if if we want to I I'm always keen on that but I Would like to talk of mostly about your piece today Ryan decisive political victory is the only way to end this cold civil war let's break it down and let's start in reverse the whole civil war what is the cold civil war to which you refer [noise]\nWell it was I'm a ... one of our frequent writers and a colleague of mine a senior fellow of ours angel could Avila didn't invent the term but he brought it back\nInto some prominent a couple of years back uh and I use it in that spirit Angelenos argument is that um the divisions between our two political parties and\nBroadly speaking the two main ideological currents that reside within them a conservatism and progressive isn't for lack of more precise terms that deep divisions have become so deep about the constitution and about how we live our lives who we are as the people that um [noise]\nYou know we're we're engaged in\nA hot civil war would be just after a bloody one on we're nowhere near that write for the most part a so called civil wars the fact that we diverge so much on on deep matters a principle that ah sometimes it feels like an sometimes our politics can operate like we're ah we're enemy is living in the same country\nAnd as a teacher as an educator and as you are and as your Institute is is I like to think ah the listeners to the show are and we try a from my perch to do we we we get instruction and give instruction often times from places we didn't see from events that were\nI guess or unforeseen\nAll of this came to a head in very sharp relief with what we've witnessed over the past month and a half or so so much so right that as it is even shaken an stirred many hard and conservatives who let's just say for one reason or another had dug their heels in\nOn abandoning the Republican Party\nSo much sharply has it brought them back to the Republican Party fair enough\nYeah I think that's very fair I think ah\nTo which I've been saying by the way I you know I've been I've been holding 'em you know John McLean welcome to the party pal I don't know why you're\nConsidered smart a lot of us have been saying this for two and a half years if not longer yeah yeah\nYeah I think the um [noise] but\nI wasn't in print I don't think I was in public somewhere but Charles Kessler said that uh you know the the ... if you want to look at how the left with like around the country look at the Capitol says yeah ah and I think um I think this week is this last two weeks a pretty good testament to the wisdom of that statement\nAnd what you write and I know you're you're a particular scholar in this given your dissertation and and and and lifetimes academic work um the Supreme Court has become you know I I guess there's two things to say about the Supreme Court for the left once you've taken over all the other major institutions\nElementary secondary post secondary education a media Hollywood a ... a start there any way or the Supreme Court that that that would be the uh that would be the price ring wouldn't it\nOh yeah and and and talk a little bit about how you write in your piece of you do a very good job talk a little bit about why the left crisis the Supreme Court so much more than perhaps almost any other institution in our in our three branches of government\nWell for one or [noise] ... it's much easier to um well I shouldn't say it's much easier it's a it's a ... it's become a nine members super legislature in many ways um and that there's some division on the court about that but the left views a judicial power and\nThe exercise of judgment just like any other power wielded by\nPeople in politics or the old argument from the federalist papers and stuff that you share his shouldn't be feared especially the Supreme Court\nBecause at its best ... exercise judgment not force or will uh you know the legislature makes the laws and that the president has to execute them the judges merely exercise judgment at their best um\n[noise] now this was implied a certain noble things about human nature and and differences in types of power\nThat are relatively fixed within the government about the left's argument I'm from a legal realists perspective was that no judicial power is just like any other political power really judgment is impossible where all politically interested actors and so it's another\nPower center to be taken over and used for good\nAnd we should really think about it differently than we would to political branches as they were down and then the living constitutional is among the left as the other side of it which is to say ah there's no fixed and principal of needing to the constitution except to the extent that it uh\nIt's standard is one of all of sudden changes with times not through amendment but through interpretation or one famous case\nHas quote for this that talked about keeping the court up to date with the developing standards of decency that parts of the process of muttering side\nCan I can I ask we're going into a commercial break and yeah we're going into commercial break can pause on that and pick up there on the other side of this break you can give me another segment came\nYeah I mean the the ah yeah the trend in our national politics abroad historical trend over time just that one or the other of two national parties dominant politics for a generation or two or three sometimes them after some ... election and and the other side has to accommodate itself\nThat new reality we just really haven't had that we looked like we may have had it during the Reagan years but uh I think more than anything rag and sort of shifted the political conversation slightly to the right I really do\nAffect any lasting real that's that's the ... right that's the one I think I subscribe to great wonderful presidency a model a conservative um touchstone for for so many of us\nBut left us after his passing with not much\nYou know even regular lamented that isn't it was a farewell address it took to the Reagan Revolution was in complete a fixed he thought standing in the way it was\nWas changed culture in many ways and kind of a different way of looking at America that had spread throughout the populace I should say though that um these arguments that I make I mean more more than anything that national political parties\nAnd how they're at loggerheads with one another I think the you know a common understanding of uh of your regular citizen Democrat or Republican or you know probably doesn't think in these terms and and I think even the average democratic voter out there are certainly doesn't think that all Republicans are always do with it but I I mean this\nIs up more and more too I mean Ryan more and more do I I have to tell you more and more to it it's increasingly difficult to have a civil conversation or for that matter and a political conversation among the group of friends\nAnd I yeah that's what I read about that ... to ... we're we're pulling away from each other ideologically the or\nYou know that the country club Republican and the blue dog Democrat are are flawed endangered extinct species in this day and age so\nThis was going to break one way or the other one of these parties is going to win this argument and then the other will have to accommodate it to the victory of the other side and adjust accordingly and I I think I'm a you know\nTrump is kind of showed the way of a new electoral coalition that's harkens back to the working class coalition of Reagan and sort of updated its new ways and it's so uh I think All right the Republicans I think by the way of building on that coalition and solidifying a while sticking to principals\nWere you when you come back I'm In the near future and the next few weeks than an hour with me and do calls on this very point because I I I mean I just think that nothing could be more important than this discussion and not just that but how we get there to how we get there I think is the most important part I Wonder if you would consider the sit down payment on that conversation\nShore so I'd love to come back alright wonderful thank you Brian Williams of Claremont dot org UCLA Ari Emma when he\nStarted or if you want to avail yourself of everything Ryan is talking about more Brian Williams thanks a lot will talk to you soon [noise]\nAffects us you betcha we are in the anti an ultimate segment of our show I'm Seth leaps and if you want to join us six

to and sad to say that I can look back and see your progression of the Republican Party and I view it\nProbably pretty close to what everybody goes but I have a different spin on it I don't want to sit in that\nYeah\n... well ... ... one of the things our founding father\nA father's kind of\nView is that a man's tendency to want to control the popular whether it's you know they look to Europe and the and they viewed it as kind of a man's tendency to put royalty in there\nAnd in America I kind of look back and think that we were stabbed wished for a type of royalty yeah but it wasn't by birthright\nPer se but it was through education and and they in like the New York elites they would build these real cultural lead and and then the Republican Party well going back to even like Kennedy they talk about Camelot and and building kind of a a royalty about it\nAnd um the conservatives and was like you know just bits starts you know with Goldwater a little bit here and there\nAnd Reagan it was the same thing it was like the um common man's ... you know it it emerged through the common man the cultural leads didn't buy into it when Reagan left or the first thing is the articles within the month\nThat the era of Reagan's over yes and I think it's because the cultural leads the Republican Party the establishment they interviewed a Russia\nAs the great evil they didn't view left ism per se as evil as though they didn't look as hard with in the ... movement within\nWas the McCarthy movement in the fifties which made the Republicans gun shy to every question the radical left within our country and and so we tend to be neutered in terms of our opposition to the advancement of the left\nAnd so we developed a Republican Party of the bakers and the diplomatic kind you know I'm the left would advance and accused and we didn't fight back 'cause we're still standing from the McCarthy Era and\nBecause they mistook communism socialism and they've focused on Russia one Russia collapsed they viewed\nOr is something now we've won and instead of realizing the issue was about centrally controlled government central planning the advance of the secular left if they had been focused on that and not\nNeutered by the uh you know McCarthy Era where they feel they can attack that left within their own country\nI think we would have had a different outcome so words\nKind of coming out of that right now and it's the Trump effect where we can be confident in climbing but\nI I don't think we're going to have a big battle that the other gentleman says I see this is the opening salvo of the new war against the left\n[noise] okay I'm a ... that there's a lot and what you said and I and I think I agree with much of it if not all of it the um the hesitant\nOr the defendants that would be the better word the dissidents that so many conservatives or Republicans a filter exercised in going after Democrats and the left the way they had no defendants or hesitancy and going against us in our political campaigns are in our\nIn our in our fights in Washington DC I'm perhaps perhaps some of it stems from from a gun shyness or having to do with McCarthy or perhaps a what I think\nThough is that when you look at the modern conservative intellectual movement that went a so strongly against that argued so strongly against an attack so harshly and rightfully so the ethos the ethics the philosophy\nGoverning intellectual of communism\nUm I mean you're talking basically about National Review magazine I mean this is what William Buckley spent his career as did those other editors and contributors\nTo national view doing indeed they even defended McCarthy I'm they went so far as that Buckley himself went so far to write a book defending a Joseph McCarthy I'm and\nSo it's it's an odd thing to me to see that the fighters of yesteryear and the fight\nThe fighting spirit of yesteryear whether it was from the ... and the national review crowd or a Barry Goldwater in his book ah or in his in his arguments on the ...\nUm that that we we we just have those very analogs today something different has happened to those something else has changed first of all we still do have socialism or we have it abroad as we have it here as never before we have another great is I'm ... I'm In\nWhether you want to call it radical Islam or Islamic fascism\nUh it it it it's the great international challenges on the on the battlefield um I I don't think about that there can be any question and it makes a pretty good analog\nTo communism or in its day uh when you look at the growth of the state one might say it's only gotten worse or one might say Goldwater and buckle his predictions have just become ever more true [noise]\nUm so you know the battles are there to be fought there's it it it's almost like a it's a loss of nerve if you will\nUm Buskirk and I have called it a conservative Stockholm syndrome where we have suffered under so long a period of liberal domination and the high culture whether it's the news media or academia or even now all I'm entering

not something the bill Buckley of yesteryear ever did they would go and he would be smart and they would argue and they would throw in intellectual punch\nYeah you know I think we have several generations of our intellectual a lead on the right\nRaised in that era where they're used to we are losing a war you know we have leadership in the eighties and early nineties where they preferred\nTo um be noble and polite and you can see that by the fact that whether we control the Senate or the house [noise] government continue to\nUse less as the advancement of a conservative

Medicare is on the ballot in November that's the government program dedicated to seniors when you play pay into your whole life under attack by dams it's called Medicare for all we're gonna talk about it later on in the show and it's not an idle plan right now in the house floor there over Seventy dams\nWould have spent years making speeches in the house a common fighting and killing and building a popular support\nKind of policy right there because I think indeed one of the tremendous lessons of World War two one of the tremendous lessons of Winston Churchill frankly\nIs that shaking hands with the opponent can be a failure and can we got to I mean the the whole point of Churchill was to bring him in because his predecessor Neville Chamberlain was too eager to shake the hand of his opponent right\n... exactly should yeah or if you're on the modern\nDay we read over it is today and land only so we could a fight over all of Europe right what benefit was there of that\nYeah yeah I was in that sense ... giving away a year up to Hitler was the product of bipartisan exactly\nYou know and I think we're in a point now today [noise] 'cause there was a survey done a few years back and you're you're\nA man of great credit ... so you probably remember this survey I just remember the result and they just [noise] these people had been surveying conservatives and liberals over many years and one of those things that they found was that basically conservatives have not really changed much\nRight right right we did this this was either ... few one of those two big guide that yes we did this a few months ago that that's right conservatives have pretty much stayed from and where they've been the liberals have moved ever left towards yes that's\nRight that's right you know the liberals have gone farther and farther left so the idea of um bipartisanship and John McCain and in the old establishment Republicans are stuck forty years ago when the when the Democrats were not that far left that's right and you can take work\nWill tell you John Kennedy what what party do you think I mean it would be impossible to say and you know there's a breeder natural determine you know da da da da da and the Democratic party I suppose for\nThe Kennedy family but if you were to go down the list of what John Kennedy actually stood for cutting tax rates strong national defense I mean what party if you just said that to any one what party would that be right I mean it's just a different party now\nRight and so I I think this is why this is why the older the establishment and the old vanguard is just kind of getting their heads together about this we're in a time\nWhether Churchill or Lincoln whether it's the civil rights movement or women's rights movement or is it right and wrong ... and ... and we have to be willing to fight we can respect it'd be nice but the ideas have to be fought for\nAnd the idea that I'm going to shake hands with a about socialist\nSay if I did you could imagine something terribly horrific would've been negotiated\nWell I think you're right on this dog and I mean this is why Denis Prager talks about clarity over agreement um because you could be agreeing to something terrible and this great quest this great talking point of I Will be bipartisan or I Am bipartisan or [noise]\nYou know it it it it it really leaves me scratching my head when you step back a moment because it's a word that sounds perhaps good to the year but when you think about what's the last\nGreat piece of bipartisan legislation that um that has a lot that has a legacy there'd be a to be celebrated um look I Am glad that on major massive definitions of America we have had bipartisanship so for example the civil rights act perhaps\nUh but you know other than that\nUm it's it's hard for me to think of great bipartisan moments in America that might be unpopular\nBut in my lifetime it's hard to think of that I Would rather convince someone in a van july's to a common sense point of view than surrender common sense just so I can say I got Democrats to support me\nI think we need to fight for ideas\nYou fight for the ideas and let the ideas when\nI'm that's what the battle is when you think are term al ... people don't want any acrimony\nThink almost every good thing that's happened with in human society oftentimes as the temporary effect of turmoil yeah an adjustment and if we're going to avoid turmoil and adjustment within society you are ... gonna stagnate and never change yeah\nAnd I mean even changing back closer to our\nI'm toning principles because I think what's happened is we have ... had so much by partisanship this is this is the establishment idea of bipartisanship the Democrats advanced to the left and we propose to slow it\nDown that's right that's right we never seemed to be of the view that it's our duty to bring them to our side it's how far do we have to walk to get them to say yes and it's never far enough there is another side to this dog\nAnd it's one worth contemplating a and we should think out loud on it together over the next few weeks if you want\nBut it is that I think it's now true that there is a divisiveness in America on matters political that is much more palpable and much more upsetting to people than has been in a while there is one\nThere is such I think um the family dinners of family gatherings social gatherings they're much more political and much more divisive than they've been in the past and that is regrettable I\nDon't think bipartisanship is the solution though and we should think about what the solution is absolutely\nWell that that ... I I have numerous\nIdeas oh good for another day will call me later on the show because I Want to go I've got to end this segment I got to move on a little bit I got a guess coming up I mean let's talk about it later on the show maybe in the third hours to be great intellectual exercise [noise] [noise] okay All right Doug alright ... leaves them succeed in order to five zero eight zero nine six zero we'll be right\nBack [noise]\n\n\n\nThe following as they paid political announcement who in their right mind would defend men call soliciting underage girls here since cinema Danny she argued that men caught with underage girls shouldn't say child prostitution charges\nIf they just cleaned the girls look donors in fact the cinema defense was used to dismiss five counts of child prostitution by a man caught someone sitting a minor right here in Arizona\nWrong and it's a troubling pattern\nHere since ... also voted against tougher penalties for criminals who commit drive by shooting\nReally even worse cinema oppose the bill that increase penalties for assaulting Arizona police officers soliciting miners drive by and assaulting police here's been sending my talks moderate and let her radical views put us all at risk\nThe real key is to send them on his radical for Arizona\nBut then there is in the paper and is responsible for the content of this advertising not authorized by the candidate or candidates committee WWW dot defend Arizona doesn't work\nThe ASU school of civic an economic sought and leadership is the only leadership program of its kind in America the polarized can compartmentalize intellectual climate on American campuses both mirrors in contributes to similar melodies in American civic life\nTo examine the problem and begin to discuss possible solutions both at the level of the campus and society the school of civic an economic salt and leadership is hosting a lecture series in conference\nPolarized nation and civil disagreement confronting America's crisis joined the panel discussion with Ross do that New York times Kathryn Lopez National Review Amy cell of an author and John Carlson ASU for\nReligion and the civics fear October sixteenth at five PM in old Maine for more information visit\nS.

E. I. C. H. E. R. T. is how we spills\nHis last name a given all the news about Nikki Haley um and uh the the the effects of that this will have the United nations on the world\nStage wanted to get some of Brandon's views on this as well as um dove into a column he wrote for American greatness\nWhich is I'm really kind of fun and interesting at the same time entitled replacing Nikki Haley why not jar von ... Donald Trump had made\nPresident Trump had made a had made a statement today that his daughter might or might be a likely successor to Nikki Haley on brand and has a thought or two on that welcome back Brandon\nIt's nice to be back in ... uh\nUh yeah I I think for every honest about this topic we I I you know watching the news this morning and I saw the kind of strange announcement that Nikki Haley was retiring resigning rather\nAnd even before it was mentioned uh I ultimately I was I flipped over to that ridiculous network MSNBC and they were kind of joking about this idea of\nA a a vodka Trump but I thought you know actually considering that it's not just of aka you'd be getting it's your coach there as well it's actually not a bad idea and um you know so I decided to sit down and write this article and ended up\nYou know they're becoming the kind of the news or the day is how Trump is President Trump has now you know fending off claims that he was going to nominate or then none of August says she doesn't she doesn't she's not going to get it\nUm it looks like it's going to be the the pow but I think the question should be asked why not ... I think you know they got a bad rap when they came in claims of nepotism claims that they add unprecedented walking privileges one\nIn fact they've actually every portfolio they couldn't give it sounds and it looks as though\nThey are good at implementing policy that that otherwise would not have happened\nYeah walk us through some of it because your article is really good and it's a good refresher no reminder 'cause a lot of the stuff just gets crowded out and a lot of it actually as you pointed out Brandon\nOr just simply a gets made sport of because you know um anything Trump I guess it's just easy fodder for ... and it ends up being I think ultimately a a bad bet no mistake to keep just to keep making sport of things\nThat he says uh usually um they pan out pretty well for him in pretty poorly for those who are making supportive protect us down the slain\nNeither a Jared Kushner I'm much more familiar with him than I Am with the wrong guy obviously I Know a block from the you know or celebrity right but but but what I Know about Jared Kushner is that he was in and you know influential member of the\nUh can't pay him that he was out of a steady hand he helped manage a lot of the the ... press relations during the campaign I you know he was he was part of that whole digital team\nUm and he he rarely tag team well at least during the campaign with you know the much maligned nowadays Steve Bannon and then when\nTrump won a you know it was kosher who was putting pressure on the transition team day you better you'd better be prepared because we want to this thing and we need to have people lined up I'm\nAnd I'm almost day one of those sort of my article he was handed what I don't know if he asked for it or not but he was handed it incredibly difficult portfolio of issues ranging from renegotiating the trade deal with Mexico\nOr all the way to you know helping resolve Middle East peace the Israeli Palestinian conflict and all yeah by the wages for sport with also try to have\nJared Kushner resolve the lawn issue right and all three of these issues he's been handed he's actually managed to definitely\nA little over the proverbial ball for every challenge that he's been given he has a he is you know overcome interestingly as as as I've written about there's also the other publications about you know my dislike for the Woodward book sphere ... but the one thing that came across in the book\nThere was a lot about Jared Kushner or one of the things that he wanted to do is have Donald Trump the day one he took office called a Mexican president and try to basically get on better terms with him and the Republicans ... certainly others were pushing against that say you can't do it\nUh same thing with health care strike a deal on immigration Springfield healthcare the Republicans like large were saying no no not a thought I was town works\nAnd what's your ... said he said look I'm a businessman from Manhattan I'm used to making deals people who have me\nYeah and he's been very good about that\nMark also of August seems to have a very firm grasp the issue she didn't want there's more domestic like paid family leave or whatnot being you know a more rights for women workers but it's all working out as they are pushing it forward it it just don't want to be happening and if it was left to someone else\nBrand and you've been around Washington long enough to um well no but you know we we we we need we need the view\nOf we we need opposition research how 'bout that a ... but isn't this precisely some of what draws so much higher against Donald Trump um is that as you point out\nThese are issues that\nYou know had been the portfolios of these great learner yeah statesmen and experts the Colin Powell and the John Kerry's\nYou know the Richard Armitage is the people with the great resumes and the friend the graduate degrees from the schools the foreign service and they never get it done and yet they have all the respect in the world whereas these amateurs who're these amateurs coming in\nWith no experience whatsoever who get it done I think this is the resentment that causes so much higher even though they don't want to say it\nOh it is also um\n[noise] you know my wife is a native of this area and she always tells me you know if he would have just kept your mouth shut\nYou probably would have gone farther on the hill yeah I'm a because it says you cannot this town is a conformity after you have to conform and I don't I don't do that um and I actually have a lot of respect for Trump and his whole family because they kinda do it their own way whether it works out or not they're gonna they're gonna do it there are way and they're going to trust their own instincts\nUm and so far it's working out fairly well um and I think that the cardinal sin a jar vodka which is not the fact that it was nepotism on display 'cause remember the Democrats had the\nKennedy of course you know I mean that was nepotism you know on Fort was of course um\nBut I think it's the fact that these kind of starts [laughter] you know who socially also even though they're very wealthy they're far wealthier than most people in the elite circles in DC\nBut they don't play in those surveyed oh yeah\nThey do and they're not the academic so they don't go to the White House and the right you know they're not the Chesapeake Bay sat there there from the Manhattan It's that was very differently than\nAnd norms but but these these two Jared evocative have to actually move the ball forward in the water thing you don't do in this town especially if you're a Republican\nIs you don't get any policy through that could actually have some lasting good for the country that only about saying now\nThat the government kind of motto mhm and if I may one thing you know my my area that I talk about is you know space to sending the satellites from attack so recently I had the pleasure of being asked by a certain\nGroup to come brief elements of the White House special Security Council\nA about what's going on with space and something that really kind of blew my mind was the gentleman who put together\nKing he and I had lunch afterward he was talking about\nHow ever since you know NASA became\nThe premier American space agency\nParticularly after the moon landings everything kind of stopped in terms of space develop right it's almost as if the bigger the bureaucracy God\nThe less got done and I said when you think about it that applies to the whole us cover the bigger the government has gotten but less things have gotten done and more problems have been allowed to fester until they're full on crises\nAre we in education like to point that I'm an awful lot of education gotten writer in America since Nineteen Seventy nine or worse when they do we what's created right that's\nRight and so I think what chairman of the other end of the bureaucracy animal will be on to them because you can't this town is a you know it's the government town and you can't do that\nVery point yeah no it's a it's a great point and you know I I you know the dream\nPalace for so many years was Syria you know and it was just you know you're after failure by\n... by the experts to John Kerry's the Warren Christopher ... or ... or the David Petraeus is\nThe same with a Palestinian Israeli uh relations you know I have\nI we're going into a break you have time for another segment I Wanna grow your sweet All right we will be right back with Brandon ... he is or um even though he lives in D.C.'s are in the house national security and foreign policy\nAnd it is it is interesting to me to think about why that is there are what how many members of the un about a hundred and Ninety One right there\nYeah yeah why why one state takes up or even if you want to throw in the entire Arab world twenty twenty two twenty three states uh ... why so much of it consumes so much time in the un it's such an interesting question\nI don't I don't remember if it was Michael Walsh his recent book fiery angel or Robert ... book the history of jihad and reading both of them are way so I Can't remember which which one it was in one of those to my mind going about this they mentioned one of them mentioned\nHow the era or the Muslim countries ah they each individually have oh yeah and that is to make you know Israeli Palestine issue such an obsession of the of the journal of the journal suddenly it but you want to sell\n'em and if you actually just you know feed it to what the Muslims how they view a world affairs they don't believe in the nation state at all they believe in over they believe in one if you're just getting to the Muslim\nCountries of the world instead of all these different votes because they're going to vote the same way on Israel you usually you know I just wanted to them he wouldn't have this obsessive quest to constantly and in Israel sticking to Israel\nA you know continue to agitate against Israel and to you know the born Palestinian\nExtremism um but because of the way the structure and the UN is all of these various countries out all agree on the issue of Israel which is that they hate it\nUm mostly from the Muslim countries they're they're given a lot of pool because they have each or like you know thirty or forty different votes mhm um and then of course they link that to an to wider anti Americanism and on the Russians and the Chinese link up with them to try to have lots and the French at times\nUh you know it's it's really it's a veritable you know hodgepodge of anti Americanism and we spent a you know exorbitant sums of money\nFor this to happen and I just you know I'm of the mind I at this point it doesn't really matter who we put there we shouldn't be seriously reducing our role there and weakening the UN as best we can\nI Wonder if you um do you have a little more time force chores\nThis or this this this is an interesting time I'm trying to remember some years ago maybe Fifteen Years ago there was a foreign policy person\nI think may be Hudson I'm trying to remember and they may be an by ... was her name or\nSomething like that who was proposing we pull out of the un and create a league of democracies and I wonder if we might just talk a little bit about that on the other side of the break or something like that would look like and generally what you would be looking\nFor if it's not a ... at the un what you would be looking for is our next or a representative our next to mess with the United nations I'm leaps and we'll be right back

something like that\nIt was around her walk or I Know it was yeah and so I'm basically pretty much it's\nThe Anglo Celtic American countries as well as Japan um South Korea Taiwan may be Taiwan or you know India possibly um and and you know that that is something that I think is a great idea for an alternative\nOne that would be shared values on that would be\nA based entirely on strategic Air National interest as opposed to these you know a more global concern is of course as a friend of mine said when I have that piece published in the cab but what about what about ah Britain and Canada and some of these other countries that are very socialist\n[laughter] socialized views on immigration and other issues that would you know make them kind of\nA weary of dealing with us how would we deal with\nWith the political differences as we've seen even been with us from the British you know government today uh how would we overcome that and you know that's that's that's a downside some of the I I thought was very interesting and I I I Can't remember the guy's name he he's he's polish she's a strategist\nBut really if you look at Brett Kavanaugh\nYes he's a brilliant jurist has all the right background and everything but he really wasn't the best choice for a Trump pack right he was a Bush ... and you know this goes back to our earlier part of the conversation and which I said Trump's victory was more so than a defeat of Hillary Clinton a Democrat to win the seat of the Bush and\nUm and so it just kind of boggles my mind that the left didn't recognize that if they had just maybe not been as crazy that during the confirmation process the fishers that exists to\nOn the right one of it never really come come out especially when you are there I think it was in the Washington Times couple of days ago Andrew ... co\nWrote an expose a about what really happened in terms of the selection process\nFor Brett Kavanaugh I met him in the Washington Times I don't remember where it was but it was the pilots on a road and basically this this choice at one from Thomas Hardiman who's in Pennsylvania who was Trump's prefer ... it was the pick of his sister who's a very well respected journalists though she's somewhat liberal I'm\nPart of it as a diamond in the rough conservative who doesn't have the baggage that that cabin audit in terms of being a bushy record I don't believe the claims against Kavanaugh\nAreas of things serial rapist um but I ... my problem with it was that he was an establishment\nYou actually were worried that Susan Collins was right and describing his act but the Democrats\nWere so deranged in and said they didn't let the process play out they played these stupid games and so good for me that it works for us obviously 'cause it galvanized the right as never before Lindsey Graham as I said in the article for God's sakes ... grams found a backbone\nRight now and Collins right I mean Iran and Susan\nCollins and so you know ... you know sort of if I was a Democrat I Would be upset you know a pox on on my own party's house but thankfully I'm not a Democrat and so I said well they should keep going keep acting crazy\nWell that's right I mean the interest on that point the Democrats were so outlandish that they turn Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham and to red meat conservative heroes yeah that's\nRight I actually just had a published a piece published that American Spectator all the less it ...\nIt and it's all about how the left had even when they didn't have political power they usually held this the high ground of culture and writer\nBut that was for not because it's the less that's defeating themselves and their uniting the writers never before and so I keep going and I think there's going to be a red tide in November because the left has overreached this is this is what happens when you step is is the great Greek tragedy of hubris\nAnd they didn't even learned the lesson of a few of two years ago because I think that was the message of the Donald Trump election in some respects they were just really tired of where the left was going and how much they had so dominated and changed America\nAnd how arrogant they were out it they are no longer they didn't even have the pretense of being the party of the ... you know and really\nThe right even though we had won the election of twenty and we won the house and the Senate or on twenty ten twelve and then we we we ran the tables and plenty fourteen\nThough right or the dying under the Obama we were spent for you and then you know Trump came along and completely changed everything and the Democrats instead of except to what happened and figure out how to do better\nThey spent the last two years whining and crying and becoming lose to ranged insurgents to now I Can't fathom it\nCan't imagine any silent majority blue collar American in any of these important swing districts\nIt's honestly looking at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh or listening to the Russia investigation\nAnd saying yeah we want we want to side with the party of\nOf of crazy you know they they they are they are I mean no matter what Trump says or does the Democrats come out and act you know what I could do is just more loud or insane and that's the genius of Trump he keeps making them go farther and farther and farther from the left and so we're going off the cliff\nAnd it didn't take that much when you think about it it didn't take that much to do is push on a few deeply held American\nValues and I say it may be more forcefully than you or I might have but that's only had to do and it's all we were ever really asking of our candidates that never really gave it to us and tell him what\nBlue everybody's mind was as he was saying this how ... was resonating\nWith ordinary people that that was the thing that Democrats are a lot like the spring to wife you know like how dare you know these people that way", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Seth
