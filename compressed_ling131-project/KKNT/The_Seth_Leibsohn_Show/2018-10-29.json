San jose Jose or San jose it's crazy this number the highest placed by house right now I think median median sales prices like one point to or something or I heard I can tell you you need you need two hundred and Seventy four grand yearly to buy a house there on my gosh minutes while\nAlso rates versus home sales um we're gonna be talking to also a little bit later in the show if you're thinking about selling your home and you've seen the commercials and the billboards [noise]\nYou know about people a point and click you know quick sales don't leave ten or twenty percent of the sales price you're home on the table\nI mean Josh if you look at it fell on your home let's say your homes worth three hundred thousand right I don't want to let everyone know you're in a million dollar home but let's say a home for three and ... and I'm just curious why not saying it's a little more than three hundred K. but let's say your homes or three hundred thousand would you want to leave thirty to sixty thousand in cash on the table\nNow absolutely not and I'm ... now this this is considered the buyer is that you're talking about yes and I buy are right correct I heard that term all the time well you ... seconds I can bring a real life scenario to you I brought a guy I met a guy on line through a lead on that I had purchased\nI started talking to him he was in Chandler\nI'm told me hey you know I'm looking to buy a home I said well what are you into with your current house he said hey already habits old I'm ... I'm not gonna say it was ... he goes I'm I'm a net about Fifteen grand like perfect that's enough for a down payment on your new home mhm he was he was right about the two Seventy five range of evidence new purchase\nBy calling me back like four days later after they ... after he had gotten more into the process mhm and he called me up and goes hey you know I Can't I Can't do uh I I I Can't tell my home to and I buy are anymore they came back to me and I I'm leaning that about a couple of hundred dollars [laughter]\nWell here's here's this here's how it goes okay so when you do one of the point and click here's an offer for your property and twenty four hours\nWhat happens is they start out with an offer initial offer may seem fairly reasonable K.\nSo then they kinda they kinda have you hooked so then you're like okay that sounds good probably excited oh yeah yeah I sold my house here's what I'm going to get so here's what happens though is then they come out to your place [noise]\nAnd they drop the old seven to twelve percent commission line Anya so they're like well here's were originally going to offer you but then there's also commissions and which by the way seven to twelve percent is quite a bit higher than what it would be if you're hired\nJason flush it results realty to sell your property so I'm doing a three hundred and twelve seven to twelve while okay so the normal real estate agent is six percent total three percent to the selling agent right page of the selling your home and then three percent to the buyers Egypt that brings a buyer if there's a buyer right\nI'm being represented by a by his agent so anyway they're seven to twelve percent\nAnd then on top of that they're going to look at your property and say oh you know what the whole needs to be painted landscape needs to be updated there's all kinds of the floor needs to be read them so then they're like we need to take another Fifteen twenty grand it could be even a lot more than that depending on the how distressed property actually is right\nSo it's just one thing after another here's what we're going to offer you now we've got seven to twelve percent commission now we have\nYou know items that we need to update on the property so next thing you know you're just so yeah so you can follow me so even after that the increase in in a commission\nThey're going to come in and take more of your profit huh exactly gotcha that's how it works ... soldiers you think the average after everything said and done percentage wise of equity\nThat you're losing a guiding it tend to twenty percent for well here here's a great example here so a home that I sold an ultimatum said oh year and a half ago a lot that er it's nice it's neat\nSo it was on fountain drive that particular property in the end the cells or the the cellar on it I Know very well so what he did as he called to the bigger ones open door offer ...\nAnd the net effect of it is he would have gotten from open door was two hundred and sixty two five I Believe okay offer it was like two fifty nine so they were very very close [noise]\nWell I put it coming soon sign up and said I'm going to listen for three thirty three thirty wow okay but I ended up selling it before it even hit the market for three hundred and thirty thousand dollars sweet it's All right there so\nHe would have left literally close to Seventy thousand dollars that's a little over twenty percent on the table now does he call just to see what they were going to do or is he has no he he calls he's one of those guys that that covers every base so he called\nAnd checked out you know a couple of different places you know because he sees it all over the place he sees them advertising on TV\nThe billboards and he's like I Wonder what they would give me but then he was smart enough to know hey that that something seems off I've known many years and I told them three thirty and he goes really he goes that these other guys are offering me such and such I said so they even talk about it so they low ball the even offer\nThey did and well the thing is is open door home mean all these other companies out there that offer the point and click right there in the business to flip homes thinking about it\nBecause all they do is they buy your home they put a little bit of money into it your money into it to fix it up as a seller and then they put it back on the market and sell it and\nYou verify all of this it's all on the on the list\nNo absolutely and then um I was talking to a group of retailers yesterday they are and one of them ... points as low as now dabbling in it mhm and uh between open door um Zillow and what's the other one ah [noise] open door Zillow Africa for\nPat from may ... of last month's um sales they almost a made up four percent\nJust under ... percent yeah for enough and and to me that's a that's a small percentage of it is yes it's a lot of homes you'd think it'd be the way that people talk about anything it'd be a much\nLarger right percentage right right and that's why all these realtors out there that are all up in arms stand there and all these point and click right companies these I buy her companies you know they're they're gonna take it all over no there there's no replacement for face to face working with a professional but does this every single day and can get ... dollars for your own\nYou know and you'll you'll only people that I've like I said if I have actually gone through with that it's been a very special situation for him you know I'm\nLike I have I Know why I close a deal on the by side where they had a very short time together house the property was really run down ... and they had a ton of equity no\nTo that and I mean in that situation for them it made sense and like she said that's a four percent of the very small percentage first so you know for someone that situation that might make more sense they don't have the time right I mean that might be what some people\nDo that well they do a lot of the hassle but I think a lot of people think it's a hassle right they think it's a hassle when in reality it's really not right\nSo the thing that I that I wanted to get across and we've been doing this radio show now Josh what Fifteen Years now we have the real estate power going and the reason we do this just to let people like that and know that there are other alternatives to selling your home I mean gray go out and get the price from them right\nThen give us a call and really see what you can get I mean why what'd you just answer this question right now why would you want to leave twenty thirty forty ran on the table\nThat's that let's let's answer that question on the air that someone who's in that situation and needs to sell their home really quick mhm could you could you remedy that we can remedy that as well absolutely or as a matter of fact ruin your\nPool of ... um you know ... your network of investors and people that could fix the police up real quick sure investors okay we\nGot one right now a Rand McClintock ... contract I was looking for the contractor sorry well yeah he's a subcontractor which is fine\nI'm over it rained McClintock so we're helping a a oh a gentleman out there Bob and marry the nicer yeah\nFree people their home has been rented out for many many years it needs to fix up oh so it's in the middle of getting fixed up right now so with the combined effort of both Bob\nHis wife and then myself getting the sub contractors in there the painters flooring fixing things up the home's going to be ready next week Oh nice and I don't charge anything for managing it you know the the seller pays the subcontractor directly\nSo there is no middleman so if you're home did does need some fix up\nIt's not that hard to do so you're just managing it yes what do you charge you for that nothing what rhymes with hero what zero model yeah some other place you don't do anything for nothing absolutely I Do absolutely ideal you check out our Web site at age CSI results real T. dot com click on the before and after years you could see\nProbably a hundred homes on their latest homes that we've done before and after is on\nSo how long do you think that from you know have they called you up marrying Bob and until list from the time they said hey we want to do this to the time will actually be a market just for people out there listening thinking hey that's it takes three months to get my house ready\nTheir particular property which needs it needs a lipstick remodel from top to bottom two weeks and that's probably most homes that people think oh this I Can't do this the ones that the ones that would take us you know a couple few months and the ones where we got to pull permits maybe there's some additions that need to be done\nWhere you're actually moving plumbing in a home so some of these homes in the middle of Phoenix and historic districts that\nYou don't have that galley kitchen and you want to remove some walls inside and really open it up where you actually need to Jack hammer and the foundation and move plumbing moved kitchens that would take two to three months\nI like the the analogy lipstick huh lifted\nWritten about it really is\nInteresting that's good stuff man really good stuff we got off on a tangent there but a later in the show I thought that's that's an important topic it is a lot of people there I mean you pass billboards and see it on TV you know what I mean it's been a lot of money in advertising\nLike back in a in a in own nine and two thousand ten realtors were like\nReal estate shocks I'm not doing real estate of the slowest it's ever been\nThat was the best for me oh nine and ten was the time to buy homes yeah\nI mean that was the bottom artist that's when you ... you had a boatload of cash to go out and buying homes and looking back in my ... too I'm telling you man it's it's when the masters said that there's blood in the street it's the worst time right now that's usually the best time to buy right it really is so back to your point in the holidays\nI Love it because there's less competition with real estate agents actually out there working I knew this fulltime let's face it Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of the license real estate agents which there's fifty or sixty thousand of them in Arizona right\nThere is only a couple of percent that do it full time and I was just at my work out this morning in Janette who we work out with their she referred her her daughter okay we'll be calling you today by the way right

December eighth man is going to be a a big change with Fannie Mae so\nI Would say get in before that change [noise]\nI'm just thinking right now let's say someone got in well let's say someone bought bought a home in mid November but they don't close till mid December can they lock into that earlier interest rate before December eighth or how does that work\nSo the the interest rate yes the interest rate will be locked in say now it works\nAbout a different version of underwriting so if you're if you're a mid mid uh you know if you're if you're not closing prior to December eighth\nYou're going to be susceptible to that new version of underwriting ... right yeah so\nLike I said you know if you're you know conventional financing starts at six twenty cycle minimum\nNow if there's ... it's not often that you're six twenty six Twenty one then you're going to run approved for for a Fannie Mae loan unless you're putting him ... big chunk of money down and kind of thirty percent now that's and that's not it's not doable but that's generally speaking right and\nSo ... you don't see approvals until closer up to you know and everything's different but six sixty six Seventy six eighty ... for for a conventional loan but like I'm saying if you're saying that six Seventy price you know fight go you're only putting five ten percent down and you're running approve now that might change after December\nSo you know a lot of in a lot of lenders out there may not be having that conversation with their buyers\nSo info yep and like we said before the holidays this ties right into a do it now yeah good time [noise]\nArizona versus the rest of the country yeah how much income do you need it and this is interesting because we talk about this quite often we have an ability throughout the nation\nWe talk about that quite often and and you know the reason I the reason I bring this up is because I was talking about um you know interest rates on the rise right and that that's a big you know kind of drawback to people wanting to buy right now our rates are going up I'm gonna I'm gonna wait right well you know I I tell people that it's probably not going to happen\nBut you know homes in Arizona and and that's why you have a lot of people flooding here are still very affordable mhm right so I'm ... on on average okay this is the national average and will break it down by cities are by I'm Sorry by states and then take Phoenix for the national average to buy a home across the United states\nIs I'm just over sixty one grand household income right doesn't seem like a lot but we are talking across the board you know complete average right yup by the ... the man everything everything right so ... and actually Arizona so listening out there are people in California maybe investors\nUm or people relocating the minute median income combined household median income to buy in Arizona is just over fifty five grand\nWhich that's not that's not crazy right I'm\nNow in the flip side of that like let's talk a San Diego right median come there and we're talking all homes hundred and thirty not that you you kind of expect that's getting up there getting up there right [noise] um let's talk New York ... and now this number kind of trips me out but only a hundred and four\nYou know what I mean wow yeah I'm surprised that is a you know maybe it was anyway but maybe some real housing that it's got to be cheaper yes um Baltimore was a sixty sixty seven to a Washington D.C.'s is up there in Ninety nine Ninety five\n[noise] um this is a crazy one Cleveland, Ohio you only need to make thirty nine thousand to buy a home in that area\nRight Josh you want to hear something funniest back in back in own nine and two thousand ten I remember we're talking about what it would take to get into the median home price now this was the bottom of the market oh nine and ten and I remember that the money you had to make was like twenty four thousand dollars and\nI remember being like twenty and then jumped to thirty three right now now we're up to fifty five ... oh yeah [laughter] and and I will say is I mean I don't say little state but our our state's growing a it's a great it's a great place to be I mean the weather is awesome\nAnd you don't have to make two hundred and Seventy five grand a year like you do in San jose and Kim household income to buy a house in San jose ... that's the highest on the list\nWhile no two Seventy four that's your neck of the woods [noise] it is I just sold that I sold ...\nUm [noise] some folks ah\nI don't want to say their name but there are they lived in white wing and are they both had jobs in San jose so they're working remotely and then he was ... a lot so he worked for Apple\nAnd that she had a tech jobs out there so they they sold their home and white wing and then moved out to San jose I'd you know what they bought I Do and they spent two point seven million on a home there that was twenty three hundred square feet\nOh how much was a square footage and the house here in Wyoming\nA little over five thousand or actually six thousand six thousand square feet foot yourself for a million eighty there you go and look at the difference oh yeah and that nuts I mean the affordability is just is the difference in affordability is insane\nI mean even though there are parts of the country Denver's booming Ninety Ninety four thousand to buy a house and you have to make that much money to buy the normal house in Denver\nCrazy well and there's a reason that a lot of people are relocating right um yeah transferring jobs out here\nGot a good buddy I went to high school with that just moved out here a couple a few months back okay over in the east mark ... so the home that he was in in San Mateo in on the peninsula their right worth a bit over a million dollars distressed\nOlder home what do you mean when you say distressed distress meaning that it still has a lot of the original Nineteen seventies I mean it's still had the little known Liam force from the seventies [noise]\nAnd he's an aircraft mechanic for American Airlines oh I Know you're talking about yeah so he was making such and such amount out there\nAnd he got a twenty thousand dollar raise to travel out here dude right and he bought the home for three hundred and four thousand deaths I remember Iran spanking new great guy and he ... American airline guy yeah Rick yeah\nSo I mean there you go and he just loves it out here or does he love it or is about if he was going to like it out and he moved out here in the summer and he goes I absolutely love it nice you know so I'm not out swinging a bat and hitting in baseballs in the street you know in the summer\nBut now I bet he loves it right now oh it's probably remind them the weather back on his motorcycle cruising around town just went to high school you know we didn't nice stories there are there's a couple of handfuls of people that I went to high school with that live in Arizona now I mean all the way out from Glendale in Peoria\nTo the far east valley out towards go canyon so they're they're sprinkled throughout the valley\nAnd it's funny hearing from them on what the initial perception was of Arizona like what people say that have never been here ... have never lived here oh it's too hot it's just the desert there's nothing there there are there and they're you know what I'm saying it's just a dirt and sand here just kicking dirt but then when you come out here and you're like well\nThere's more golf courses per capita than any other ... around you know a a\nThe affordability as their restaurants they're on every corner like all my friends from the bay area\nThere's like one or two restaurants they go to all the time ... and the iron gate and that is

edition of discoveries in hell I'm your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affect each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThey are it's great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects their body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this I'm On a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress hinted tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that in their in their upper back and you fill Italian is right and the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel that test that most of the arteries and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles\nIn and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nHealth and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people do you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurts more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement or how many ... ... it\nHas to do with simple absorption calcium beginning absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYeah OK yeah it does build your teeth but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates and your blood\nSo in that one percent drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidney their organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones and self\n... orbit back from the bones if ... that's right but I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yeah\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nFor sure just drink milk just\nDrink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy a house which started right right right but these things don't absorbing the body\nUp for a couple of reasons one when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in it like a dumb first of all calcium absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the end the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nBut comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences that the powder\nAnd what happened to put it in hot water and you mix it up and drink it down so in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's also a problem that well\nYeah because when calcium and magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact is I'm I'm reading the can right now says the fans to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium it takes a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys are you on pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the need is being absorbed mhm you're not going to suffer from all the things\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body\nCable news all the time quoted all the time uh people tended to be staffers either and in ministry Russian or\nFor a um [noise] for a congressional committee or a congressman or senator or worked in the whole staff or would have been by definition in the administration [noise]\nUm sometimes their pollsters they can just say wrong things on and on and on over the years and prognosticators gifts wrongfully on and on and on over and over again over the years\nUm and never go away and they keep coming back they keep getting contracts or to be um [noise] on call for the for the for cable news the contracts are pretty hefty uh they're pretty good\nI've ah seen some of them and you know there's just no accountability ever for being wrong or I guess for being stupid\nUm and the latest I think goes to Bill Kristol a someone who's decline and fall over the years um and by over the years I mean two or three somebody put it longer I'd put it at about two or three\nUm has just been I think embarrassed to him an embarrassing for him and sent to watch a first I knew a bill\nHe was some writing serious academic works you know he was a professor at Harvard PHD student and political philosophy student of one of the great political philosophy professors of our age men in Turkey Mansfield [noise]\nI'm doing doing good writings on the federalist papers and\nPolitical philosophy and then started work in the Reagan Administration and a than a little bit in the Bush to administration the first Bush administration sorry as chief of staff to Dan Quayle\nAnd then he of course founded the Weekly Standard magazine which did a lot of good humans work early on I think it would be unfair to say singlehandedly responsible but one or\nOne of a a few handful of people and institutions that we're almost singlehandedly responsible for defeating Hillary care [noise]\nUm but of late [noise] it the decline has been a both a precipitous and set to watch uh over the weekend he declared\nThat a\nLot of Fox News personalities or should resign or be fired from Fox News he's taking on Fox News\nSays I'm a free speech person and I'm not for super ... I'm not for being super fastidious about calling people to account about things that are set in the heat of the moment\nBut at the end of the day I think Fox with its evening line up Fox Business with Lou Dobbs the routine stuff that have said they're people who work at Fox the management of Fox the shareholders Fox the corporate board a Fox really need to look in the mirror and say we're comfortable with this [noise] we're making money but are we comfortable\nWith this ah and he said this in context of um the Pittsburgh massacre when he's talking of the evening line up at Fox it's interesting who would be talking about who would he be talking about Tucker Carlson to be sure Sean Hannity to be sure\nI'm the only other one uh that would probably qualify will be Laura Ingraham who used to work for Bill Kristol by the way as did Tucker Carlson they both used to work for Bill Kristol Tucker at the Weekly Standard and Laura Ingraham at the department of education\nHunter William Bennett and uh so special call out I'm sure to both of them\nAlong with Sean now I don't watch them every night\nOr or even most nights but I watch them a fair amount and I try and catch a lot of their stuff after it airs especially if they have interesting interviews I I I I don't know of anything irresponsible that they should be blamed for and I think this is our main problem with people like Bill Kristol\nWhich is when you have a platform and it is a gift to have a platform it as a gift to be able to be paid attention to for your thoughts and opinions\nAnd you are a quote unquote conservative are quote unquote Republican why is your fire always trained on your own team is it because you actually believe it and if so then let's examine those beliefs\nBut I don't know how you can examine these beliefs in the context of the crap CNN puts out and has been putting out steadily and more and more lately so I don't think it's that is it too cozy up\nIs it to get a better contract with one of these networks and MSNBC let's say or a CNN notice how much they liked to have never Trump Republicans on their payrolls\nNotice how much they liked to praying about having Republicans on their payrolls but then when you examine these Republicans on their payrolls it's hard to find any of these people ever saying anything that looks remotely like\nSomething the Republican Party believes in or could come out of the Republican Party platform because it doesn't these people are liberals\nWho have a far and longer go far left the Republican Party and the conservative movement they just haven't changed their registration\nWhy [noise] because if they did they wouldn't have those gifts\nThat's the dirty little secret here if they actually change their registration and call themselves Democrats\nThey wouldn't have those gigs and why wouldn't they have those gigs they wouldn't have those gigs 'cause they're just not as good at the leftist democratic stuff as the leftists and Democrats who have been doing it for years are\nAnd they're not to be trusted that's why that's why but as long as they can maintain\nSome semblance of an inherent to the Republican Party or a recent past working relationship with the Republican Party [noise] boy that's part of the golden revolving door of Washington DC to it's not just becoming a lobbyist folks [noise] getting these really good six figures contracts with cable companies [noise]\nLook at what CNN Mr crystal if you watch it and I suspect you don't [noise] because you spend so much time blather about [noise] if you watch CNN [noise] do you see it is so much worse I'll give you an example of that and we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThe constitution is under attack our country is at a

or what you and you know a grade school middle school and high school out here and what was your high school it was desert just an homage to thousands alumni okay and uh shortly after high school I ended up joining the United States Navy honorably served from two thousand two to two thousand and tune and move\nInto does NATO was severely wounded in Afghanistan fighting with marine says they are as a hospital corpsman\nAre you comfortable talking about that battle a little bit we had I think our audience would like to hear it Yes sir sir\nSo uh you know my unit we we took a lot of casualties are myself being included um altogether we last night the Marines one corpsman in one interpreter and in a pond getting home we lost thirty additional Marines and sailors to suicide so I'm an owner say about a hundred and\nEither a hundred and sixty a hundred and thirty of us were end up uh being wounded and I'm thirty ... including myself is just\n... we went through a lot I'm I'm not going to light up the plane that was a it was a rough deployment\nSo rough deployment did you sign up for the military because of nine eleven or\nI did so shortly after nine eleven um I was talking to some buddies of when we wanted to do something about what took place I mean an attack just happened to our whole home soil and so I'm a handful of my buddies returning to the army I wasn't comfortable with army so I started going to the other recruiting officers in the navy what's a good comfort level for me\nGiven all the water we have in Arizona the navy seemed like a natural for you [laughter] I'm after Afghanistan and when you came back home tell us what you do what you did than\nUh I was wrongfully denied by July which is an acronym short for a traumatic servicemen scoop life insurance as well as Social Security or the benefits and so I'm not only that but my parents were traveling from Phoenix to San Antonio where I spent the first year of my recovery and uh they spend a little over twenty five thousand dollars just on flights and travel alone\nBut at the department of defense the marine corps navy weren't offering my parents and you kind of travel assistance or any any of the wounded love forms of family members and so\nUm there was that family piece that's that struggle and then my my piece my struggle was the benefit side of things so Christmas of two thousand and two

wings for Anthony was a fundraiser to help pay my mom and dad back it was actually our our local church growing up here in Phoenix so wings for Anthony raised a little over twenty five thousand for my

themselves but the families and their caregivers of those uh those veterans and there's a lot of a healing heroes is what we like to call them that need some additional assistance sometimes that assistance could come straight from families so what wings for warriors does is a\nUm we we provide insights tools and resources to where the worst as they go to the ... a transition into a new realities which would be\nGoing back to school building a family's starting a family um [noise] there's entrepreneurial ah programs as well that we're we're providing to them but really it's a it's just resources that's mainly what we do\nJames Madison talked about democracy here\nWorking because of auxiliary organizations or something to Tocqueville picked a theme he picked up on later all God's Children have work to do so whether you Don the uniform or not if you want to help those who have served our country wings for words is a great place to help\nAnd you guys aside from being able to take any help on line you're having a a big gala coming up as well November right\nIt's a Saturday November tents which is the marine corps birthday and a day before Veterans Day so a perfect perfect data habits um it's it's called a night of honor and giving so that's exactly what it is it's a night to honor the veterans that have given so much to our country\nAnd again the website I'm going to let you give it out as much as you want if people want to go to the scale our help out\nThat'd be great yeah we're just encourage people to attend so that they can be educated on what's going on in the military family and caregiver but mainly the wounded warrior communities across the United states and do although we're a Phoenix based nonprofit are we are serving in twenty eight different cities\nAnd that they would like to attend or purchase tickets to the game or they can go to ... dot org\nWings for warriors dot org or like Web sites that tells you exactly where to go and where they are ... keep it simple that's great what would you communicate Anthony ... so many of us are so supportive\nBut we now live in a I'm In an interesting time where I don't know a generation ago everyone either if they didn't have a family member in the military they certainly knew someone who was in the military that's not the case anymore not only is um is is the difference between those who serve and those who know people who serve\nFarther and farther apart it's getting even farther and farther and worse um by the year and hopefully not by the generation about a year\nWhat would you um what would you tell people who have not had much if any contact with those who have done during uniform uh ... what what what do they need to know and what would you say and encouragement for you know them to join\nFirst thing that comes to mind is a don't be afraid to ask questions a show that you're interested um a lot of people I think are quiet and stand on the sidelines especially to those that are in uniform whether it be the airport or in public or at like a special sporting event or something to that effect or don't don't be\nYou know I'm just saying thank you even though you think that that's all people say that it's just sometimes like a U.S never enough up or just give him a hug shake their hand and just say thank you we know what that means yeah appreciate it every time\nThat is good and you know you went through um some of the hardest stuff anyone could ever imagine though you went through it you still encourage people to um enlist or join the military if that's or something they are at least in in the slightest even interested in doing\nOr without getting without getting political sure ah we've always been in the ... men so someone's going to need to step up and sign up and do it and we need the younger generations to get up and fight 'em there's a big sense of pride in that and I think that our country is a very powerful country and we need the ... citizens of which to protect us\nAnthony as someone who has been to Afghanistan who has fought for the country there and as this war has you know gone on for as long as it has what would you tell people who have not taken a deep dive into what's going on there or haven't looked at it and a long time\nWhat would you what would you have them know about that country and uh our our deployment there\nI Know that's a big questions related question in a it's going to be at a small tiny little answer on not everyone's bad\nThat there's there's good villages um there's bad villages and I'm\nJust like here in the states there's always the bad eggs that unfortunately represent does the the the grander population I get the attention that get the attention right because it's negative and so um my experiences there we're not we're not truly um\nPleasant there'll be a word I Would choose to use your but um\nYou know someone asked me recently actually a similar question but they said that you have any happy times over there yeah and I really couldn't think of an answer you know it wasn't until after I unfortunately lost the opportunity to answer that woman\nBut uh my wife was sitting right next to me one night we were watching TV and I got a text from an old marine and it was all of us messing around when when we had a little bit of down time which we didn't get all the time right but during that downtime we make we make the best of it right and so I did have some happy times with my Marines and sailors why we're over there fighting\nAnd do you um ... where where do you plan to go from here you've been doing humans work for wings for wars it's a great organization do you yourself you said without getting political do you yourself sometimes think about maybe getting a getting into politics or doing something in public policy on this front\nHere no no no loyalty to really good point because you know the other thing that's lacking was talking to our guest Anthony not only about [noise]\nHow we've created a new generation of people that are so disconnected from the military you know uh it sounds like you're old enough to remember a time when if a family didn't have someone in the military they knew someone in the military and that's just less and less and less the case\nAt the same time something else tragic is going on Harry right and it's in our education system which is where you went to which is interesting to me just we just don't learn about\nYou know we just don't learn our history anymore we don't learn about the sacrifices we don't learn about the heroes saw on TV there's an outing Murphy week coming up I bet there's no one under the age of thirty who knows who are Murphy's\nCorrect and and that and that is a scandal that is a scandal and it is a harm it is a harm um it it's a harm to our children it's a real harm to our children\nI was a young person during the second World War there I never\nSaw anyone who was in Riyadh and for the car you know\nAnd uh it's a different time now but thank you for doing what you're doing so we couldn't remember these folks uh I'm I'm eighty four and I've seen a lot of changes and that's ... well you keep up the good work we really appreciate\nHarry I appreciate you more than you know thank you sir I appreciate your call and I appreciate your comments all God's Children have work to do as I said whether it's in the military or something else worthwhile but his point\nThat Harry made a and that we talked through about not only the disconnected missing the generations um between you know military and the non military\nUm it is something that I keep returning to it seems I Do it about once a month maybe twice a month and probably could do it more and it's about the way we teach in this country and what we what our kids knowing what they don't know\nUm it was the theme Ronald Reagan struck the strongest in his farewell message it was a it was the same about not\nKnowing um our history anymore and I'll play a little bit\nOf that when we get back and they don't want to read you some testimony the great American historian David McCullough gave\nTo the United States Senate on this um I think you'll find it I opening at the same time as I think you will find it tragic um basic point is and we have this discussion a lot and we're having\nNow again a with regard to illegal immigrants as I'm Serious an issue as it is and it is and we're all about it\nIt's important to think about the aliens who make of our own children we make of them aliens to a country they do not know fifty percent of them graduate with an F in American history or below basic score in American history it is their worst subject and that is just\nAn intellectual crime on so many levels [noise] talk a little bit more about that I didn't know we'd go here but it's fine it's important to six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nNine sixty no matter what your caller nearly five
