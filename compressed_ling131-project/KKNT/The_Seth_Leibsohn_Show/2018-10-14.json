this\nIs it is it's done incorrectly and I've heard lots of bad solar stories and that's where the bachelor stories come from if it's not done correctly with the right amount of electricity being produced on your roof\nWith the right weight plan and with demand management because many of these great plans that you can only be on with solar if you do not manager demand that adjuster\nThat's charging you very very highly a ... a very ... much higher charge for your power between three and eight PM abs and s R P it's one to one does a one to eight and three to six [noise]\nIf you don't manage your demand you could end up having still a very high bill connected to the electric company so this is why I say to people I use the analogy\nThere is lots of companies out there that can make hamburgers there is only one that has the secret sauce I Am not trying to sort of anybody under the bus I'm not trying to say anything bad about any other company I'm just saying make sure when you're going to consider P. Y. O. P.\nThat you're working with somebody who cares just like I cared\nAbout my daughter and my grandkids home to make sure it was done correctly because in my experience there's a lot of solar sales people out there and I'm not one of them I'm not a soldier sales person I'm a mom and her grandmother retired nurse\nThat figured out that this was a very good solution for my own daughter and my own family at reducing the\nCost of their power which they would continue to need\nFor for for as long as they're in the house so basically they're going to be paying a power bill or power cost every month every year for decades to come\nAnd that's what we're all faced with so the only way to get away from what's going on with that's affecting our power companies pay the electric companies want to charge us more for the same power they sold us last year and now politics getting involved in it and there's these prop one twenty sevens and God only knows what else is coming down the pike\nIs produced your own\nPower and you're going to pay less for between seven and half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nThe average health food Jeremy if they just use the average amount of electricity over the next Twenty years with a very conservative number three percent increases over the next Twenty years we the as we've seen increases a far greater than twenty percent this year so I'm being very conservative when I say\nThese increases we don't know what they will be a year after year after year and they keep sending out email or messages and advertisement you know little jingles like oh be energy efficient whatever the only way to be energy efficient and be able to afford to live comfortably in your home is go out of the house\nDuring the daytime and go to the mall or go to the movie theater which is absolutely ridiculous you've worked so hard\nTo live comfortably in your home you for your family your retirement et cetera\nAnd these power companies that are dictating to us how much power we can use\nAnd how ... it is it are unaffordable unaffordable that is when we use it it's absolutely atrocious so the way that you get you get ahead of this and you don't have to worry about this any more\nIs go to my website um German is going to give that out call me I'm again you pay ... we we can we can all collectively go down and rant and rave\nAt at group meetings and try and be heard in front of the Arizona corporation mission I just talked to somebody this week that he was on the ballot he didn't meet the primary he is a great guy great Christian man\nHow they don't want to get people on the Arizona Christian origin I'm Sorry I'm I'm not saying that everybody ... Arizona corporation your mission but I'm telling you I've heard more of a good people that have not gotten on to the Arizona corporation or mission because I think it's the old boys' network so again so you don't let these things affect your family your hustles budget\nGo to my website filled out the killer worksheet and keeps telling me how much power you used how badly how's your bill increased um in two thousand Eighteen from two thousand Seventeen and let's get you're producing your own power paying less for it and so these things won't ever affect your family and your household budget ever again\nYeah I heard some people talk about how easy it is and you're right you just go to the website asks solar Sandy dot com that ask solar Sandy dot com or you can call six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine one more time six to three eight zero eighty two twenty nine and\nSometimes you have your uh say don't fall for the fake people these are why we get bad stories everybody who works with us we know they're going to have great outcomes so we want you to get the real deal that's where you go to ask solar Sandy dot com ask solar Sandy dot com\nYou know it's so funny Jeremy I feel like I'm On a on a roll on on a tangent today but I so I'm so upset about um I at the I've been in homes this summer where people have kept a thermostat at eighty five eighty eight um the next increase or new fee taxes surcharge that they decided to add on somebody's bill\nWhat Ninety Ninety five degrees to the point where people's health and wellbeing are being compromised because of the greed of these power companies\nSo again you know five years ago in my daughter's neighborhood there was only maybe two homes that had solar on it now there is only two homes that don't so it's really important everyone I Know that you probably\nAt some point now are starting to look at oh my gosh are we going to be able to afford our power bills\nAnd he'll this year some of you haven't even seen the full impact of it your own budget building with a PS you could end up with a subtle amount at the end of the year it could be five hundred that could be a thousand dollars this is how deceptive these new rate plans are\nOn a PS recommended ... plans for he said oh they're very similar to your old rate plan makes sure um if you're on\nBy may first some people were migrated over be before me first but if you're on the budget billing you may not see the full extent of abs is\nUm you know impact on your family is ... ... ... families and hopefuls budget because if you aren't paying the right amount on your budget billing you will have what's called the federal amount at the end of the year if you do not pay that settled come out your power will get shut off\nSo at the end of the your Christmas or just after Christmas didn't your lessons on December\n... can you imagine getting a a setup amount for eight hundred thousand dollars Jeremy ... there'll be a worse time right and if you and you know if you don't pay that your power gets ... and if you don't head on time you get taken off budget building\nSo by producing your own power ... so there is a way for me to help my abs families eliminate owing anything to a PS you're going to produce all the power you need for your home your day your nighttime and a little bit extra\nThere was a deadline that I was talking about in previous weeks August thirty first it was the buyback program anybody that worked with me and got in before August thirty first\nThey had to buy back of twelve point nine for any extra power that they didn't consumed during the day they were sending to a PS is good and they were buying it for twelve point nine\nA PS apparently four hundred and eighty eight million dollars isn't enough for them so they're now dropping that under review with the Arizona corporation commission you think they're going to get the approval of course they are down from twelve point nine to all of them points that it has not been an act and yet I cannot guarantee that\nUm even if today you got if I got your application and with a P. S. you're going to get the whole point nine but dead end before they take the eleven point six cents away from us completely\nSo any extra power you're exporting back to the grid is a monetary credit on your bill not a kilowatt hour credit a monetary credit so those kilowatt credits are starting to produce a monetary credit on your bill\nCovers these taxes and your nighttime power so at the end of the year I have many of my families that are going to have checks back one thousand two thousand maybe even more back at the end of this year so\nAgain so you are locked into your own rate of between seven and half a neat and have since ... daytime nighttime that will be you know you're you're you're on ... on the off peak power that you're producing on your roof will be range between seven and a half and half cents per kilowatt\nIf you go to a passes website and are familiar with those those rate funds right now there is no rape plan on a pits as well say or ... either that offers your power on peak or off peak at a guaranteed rate of seven and half the eight and a half cents per kilowatt that lock she went for the next twenty five thirty years\nThat's the only way that you can lock in your own power prices by producing it yourself and not being subject to\nFuture and there's going to be more of them many more of them and things like prop one twenty seven is going to impact our costs a PS\nAs opposed to this the reason they're opposed to this and do their up already pencil into their um their their operating costs fifty nine hundred megawatts of natural gas plant\nWhich there's they're going to make a lot of profit on building the natural gas plants they do not want to add solar onto their operating costs because that's a reduced\nNumber of reduced a profit to them so of course are opposed to it because they've already got the rates are approved over the next X amount of years based on those operating expenses so\nEight the U.S is opposed to it\nSo but it's just ... and again I'm not recommending to anybody for it or against it at this point because there's too many changes that are continuing to come down the pike and until I really know what to recommend to people the only thing that I can recommend is the only way that these kinds of things are not going to affect your individual families and hustled\nJust texture ZIP Code to eighty two thousand the

folk so according to my next guest if you think the cold and flu season is behind us you better think again the truth is that viruses colds and the flu can strike almost any time of the year which is exactly why you should be doing everything you can to protect yourself no matter what time of year it is\nSo what's the best way to protect yourself from these nasty viruses the colds and the flu\nWill here today to share his health secrets\nFor shielding against viruses colds and the flu is Dr Michael Pincus start debating gives his great to see it again Chris it's great to be here you know most of you probably know the doctor and it gives us a nationally recognized authority on both natural and alternative health he's also a very successful chiropractor he's being sought out by top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes any continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns so Dr biggest what is this how secrets that you've been talking about\nWell what the secretive as actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C. vitamin C.\nOr I Will uh vitamin C is is not really new though\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal health and unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends in the bottom line is with out enough fight him and see and the right type of vitamin C.\nU. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies diabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be shortened by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contained off sixty five milligrams\nOf vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day while three to four thousand a year and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice so because of lack of vitamin C. they were getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well\nThe number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just don't any energy I don't feel like myself\nI'm hurting yup and then the doctors to get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we got to do this task send you through the scanner and the problem is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd it was interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. All right we are the ones on any pigs primates and the fruit bat\nWhen you look at the rest of the animals out there\nYou don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure you don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nYeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it you know right\nBut you know I think most people and myself included sink and vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is it\nKnow what it is actually the common denominator the lack of\nThat means the and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my supersede twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down to have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. oh that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... is your body needs different forms of it\nAnd I put it all into one vitamin formula now and you said that was how much vitamin C. and your supersede twenty to forty years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're going to experience is energy vitamin C. produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained waking diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is it okay if I read an email to shore alright sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay I'll listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped it he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days\nHe said now another thing that happened is I became more alert\nAnd I now have a clear head off and vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nSo it's been really talking to us about vitamin C. and I'm like most of you I was more under the impression that vitamin C. was instrumental in helping to boost your immune system then all of these other things that we've been talking about a including being able to\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you\nCan see where people are confused well Chris I sat in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I did go to the supermarket before I got here [laughter]\nOkay and I brought some vitamin C. and I I went and bought these and\nI'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in itself right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well just one type of ... right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has\nOh you Los they'll sell off the ground up newspaper alright the next one is uh vegetables Derek Ghassan now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form of a and the next one is a sort of like a silica sand sand like the beach\nSorry so here's another one try this one here okay so one of the national ... right right so this was five hundred milligrams okay this is a tool yes All right so take a look at the ingredients okay I'm a person gr is sucrose sugar okay ... sugar\nSodium a score right that's a form of vitamin\nC that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium\nRide vegetables therapist said that that lubricant again and empty and see yellow number six there you go a number\nSix so now that's artificially collared vitamin C.\nNow what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different from these that we are talking about\nWell what's different about is I use twenty two different forms of vitamin C. and it's all naturally flavored natural colors there's nothing artificial in it Chris so it's good for you\nIt's the only one that has this unique delivery method of being able to drink it down as water soluble goes right to work and your body and it has\nThe proper amount of vitamin C. per survey there's Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving ... there's nothing else on the market like it I've done tons of research vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies and it's really survive the test of time and what do these studies suggest what are they saying well I'll give you I'll give it a couple of headlines\nThis study was conducted at the University of California\nAnd it found that people who to the vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease were reduced over forty percent ... a study reported in the international journal vitamin a nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes out ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C in their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Mila leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system or energy that's just from vitamin C. wow\nNow earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work\nWell this is the kind of groundbreaking research on vitamin C. and weight loss but what happens is vitamin C is a natural appetite suppressant and it also increases your metabolism and your energy when your energy goes up yeah you start feeling better you can go out and take a walk let's burn some of it off\n[noise] so you've created this supersede twenty to formulate

I Know I Am I'm you know Dr brings with all of this emerging information that's out there why do you think we're not hearing more about the benefits of vitamin C.\nIt's not a sexy trend but vitamin C. has survived the test of time it's been around it was discovered in the Nineteen thirties ... vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies in fact one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years\nWell who who should I mean is a perfect candidate that you can describe that that should be like it's a no brainer beyond your super see twenty two formula\nWell yes I Would say first of all if you're listening out there and you're over the age of sixty it's a no brainer\nThere you you absolutely need to get on my super see formula because you manifest symptoms more readily than younger people mhm for those of you who are younger and your child bearing years ... is necessary for you and your baby and those of you and your forties and fifties and\nThese are the ages that I call your insurance age vitamin C is the most important thing you can do to protect yourself Mm\nSo get on it even if you're not manifesting symptoms get on it and stay on it okay and for those of you who have teenagers or young children I started my son very very young on super see and I can tell you I can count on one hand the number of times he's been sick\nThrough his childhood and teen years so when I say it's super see it is super see [laughter] it's a great formula\nAnd by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that\nYou'll experience well the first thing you're going to experience this energy and along with that comes mental clarity less pain better vital signs like blood pressure starts to go down you'll see that your cholesterol is improving your HDL the good cholesterol goes up and was there I go down the inflammatory markers in your blood started to go down\nYou know Chris we're talking about health here right\nWell and unfortunately Dr putting us we are about out of time here at any anything else you want to share with the with our listeners today that Chris first of all I Want to thank you again for having me on your oh it's always a great fun especially when it's a surprise like this\nWith the right weight plan and with demand management because many of these rape plans that you can only be on with solar if you do not manager demand that adjuster that's charging you a very very highly a ... a very ... much higher charge for your power between\nThree and eight PM a PS and as our kids wanted to sit on just a one to eight and three to six if you don't manage your demand you could end up having\nStill a very high bill connected to the electric company\nSo this is why I say to people I use the analogy\nThere is lots of companies out there that can make hamburgers there is only one that has the secret sauce I Am not trying to sort of anybody under the bus I'm not trying to say anything bad about any other company I'm just saying make sure when you're going to consider P. Y. O. P.\nThat you're working with somebody who cares just like I cared about my daughter and my grandkids home\nTo make sure it was done correctly because in my experience there's a lot of solar sales people out there and I'm not one of them I'm not a soldier sales person I'm a mom and grandma and retired nurse\nThat figured out that this was a very good solution for my own daughter and my own family at reducing the cost of their power which they would continue to need for for for as long as they're in the house so basically they're going to be paying a power\nBill or power costs every month every year for decades to come\nAnd that's what we're all faced with so the only way to get away from what's going on with that's affecting our power companies a the electric companies want to charge us more for the same power they sold us last year and now politics getting involved in it and there's these prop one twenty sevens and God only knows what else is coming down the pike\nIs produced your own\nPower and you're going to pay less for between seven and half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nThe average house so Jeremy if they just use the average amount of electricity over the next Twenty years with a very conservative number three percent increases over the next Twenty years we the as we've seen increases a far greater than twenty percent this year so I'm being very conservative when I say\nThese increases we don't know what they will be a year after year after year and they keep sending out email or messages and advertisement you know little jingles like oh be energy efficient whatever the only way to be energy efficient and be able to afford to live comfortably in your home is go out of the house\nDuring the daytime and go to the mall or go to the movie theater which is absolutely ridiculous you've worked so hard\nTo live comfortably in your home you for your family your retirement et cetera\nAnd these power companies that are dictating to us how much power we can use\nAnd how ... it is it or I'm a ... a unaffordable that is when we use it it's absolutely atrocious so the way that you get you get ahead of this and you don't have to worry about this any more\nIs go to my website um Germany is going to get that out call me I'm again you I mean we we can we can all collectively go down and rant and rave\nAt at group meetings and try and be heard in front of the Arizona corporation commission I just talked to somebody this week that he was on the ballot he didn't meet the primary he is a great guy great Christian man\nHow they don't want to get people on the Arizona Christian which I'm Sorry I'm I'm not saying that everybody ... corporation your mission but I'm telling you I've heard more of a good people that have not gotten on to the Arizona corporation mission because I think it's the old boys' network so again so you don't let these things affect your family your hustles budget [noise]\nGo to my website filled out the killer worksheet and keeps telling me how much power you used how badly how's your bill increased um in two thousand Eighteen from two thousand Seventeen and let's get you're producing your own power paying less for it and so these things won't ever affect your family and your muscles budget ever again\nYeah I heard uh some people talk about how easy it is and you're right you just go to the website\nAsks solar Sandy dot com that ask solar Sandy dot com or you can call six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine one more time six to three eight five zero\nEighty two twenty ninth and sometimes you'll hear a say don't fall for the fake people these are why we get bad stories everybody who works with us we know they're going to have great outcomes so we want you to get the real deal that's where you go to ask\nSolar Sandy dot com ask solar Sandy dot com\nYou know and so funny Jeremy I feel like I'm On a on a roll on on tangents today but I so I'm so upset about um I I've been in homes this summer where people have kept a thermostat\nAt eighty five eighty eight um the next increase or new fee taxes surcharge that they decided to add on somebody's bill\nWhat Ninety Ninety five degrees to the point where people's health and wellbeing are being compromised because of the greed of these power companies so again you know five years ago in my daughter's neighborhood there was only maybe two homes that had solar on it and now there's only two homes that don't\nSo it's really important everyone I Know that you probably at some point now are starting to look at oh my gosh are we going to be able to afford our power bills\nAnd he'll this year some of you haven't even seen the full impact of it your own budget building with a PS you could end up with a subtle amount at the end of the year it could be five hundred it could be a thousand dollars\nThis is how deceptive these new rape plans are\nOn a PS recommended rape Humphrey said oh they're very similar to your old rate plan makes sure I'm sure that you're on by may first some people were migrated over ... before may first but if you're on the budget billing you may not see the full extent of abs is\nUm you know impact on your family is hopeful ... families and hopefuls budget\nBecause if you aren't paying the right amount on your budget billing you will have what's called the federal amount at the end of the year if you do not pay that settled them out your power will get shut off so at the end of the year Christmas or just after Christmas didn't your lessons on December\n... can you imagine getting a a a setup amount for eight hundred thousand dollars Germany or could there be a worse time right and if you and you know if you don't pay that\nYour power gets ... and if you don't have it on time you get taken off budget building so by producing your own power ... and so there is a way for me to help my abs families eliminate owing anything to a path\nYou're going to produce all the power you need for your home your day your nighttime and a little bit extra\nThere was a deadline that I was talking about in previous weeks August thirty first it was the vibe that program anybody that worked with me and got in before August thirty first they had to buy back of twelve point nine for any extra power that they didn't consumed during the day they were sending to a PS is good and they were buying it for twelve point nine\nA PS apparently four hundred and eighty eight million dollars isn't enough for them so they're now dropping\nUnder review with the Arizona corporation commission you think they're going to get the approval of course they are down from twelve point nine to eleven points that it has not been enacted yet I cannot guarantee that um even if today you got if I got your application and with a pianist you're going to get the whole point nine but dead end before they take the lead them point six cents away from us completely\nSo any extra power you're exporting back to the grid is a monetary credit on your bill not a kilowatt hour credit a monetary credit so those killer credits are starting to produce a monetary credit on your bill\nCovers fees taxes in your nighttime power so at the end of the year I have many of my families that are going to have checks back one thousand two thousand maybe even more back at the end of this year so again\nSo you are locked into your own rate of between seven and half and ... cents per kilowatt daytime nighttime that will be you know you're you're you're on ... on the off peak power that you're producing on your roof will be range between seven and eight cents per kilowatt\nIf you go to a passes website and are familiar with those those plans right now there is no rape plant on a piece as well say or ... either that offers your power on peak or off peak at a guaranteed rate of seven and half the eight and ... cents per kilowatt that lock she went for the next twenty five thirty years\nThat's the only way that you can lock in your own power prices by producing it yourself and not being subject to\nFuture and there's going to be more of them many more of them and things like prop one twenty seven is going to impact our costs a PS\nAs opposed to this the reason they're opposed to this they're up already pencil into their um their operating costs fifty nine hundred megawatts of natural gas plant which there's they're going to make a lot of profit on building the natural gas plant they\nDo not want to add solar onto their operating costs because that's the reduced\nNumber of reduced a profit to them so of course are opposed to it because they've already got the rates are approved over the next X amount of years based on those operating expenses so atheists as opposed to it\nSo but it's just ... and again I'm not recommending to anybody for it or against it at this point because there's too many changes that are continuing to come down the pike and until I really know what to recommend to people the only thing that I can recommend is the only way that these kinds of things are not going to affect your individual families and helpful\nAffordability and your power costs and living comfortably in your own home is PY O P produce your own power pay less for\nMore sports medicine for for our love of our agencies\nOld process

the other one\nIs you tend to get more calls especially upper respiratory problems okay problems with\nBlood pressure cardiovascular problems digestive problems consultation bloating gas ... that's very very common and if you're a diabetic there's all kinds of data about being the fishing vitamin D and the list goes on and on it's a huge problem what\nDoes vitamin D actually do in the body what does it use for\nWell when we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D is actually a hormone okay\nAnd that regulates thousands of genes in the body everything from pain blood sugar immune system blood pressure falling string plus he has been linked to maintaining call and healthy breast and ovarian health\nBut I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all

worthless\nOr God Forbid if you're listening right now and you're taking a multi vitamin and you think your harbored fats while you're on six or eight or ten different prescription drug I'll tell you

they're using a technology to convert vitamin D which is an oil into a dry powder and what to say that they put in a combat dissolving Mel for immediate action and quick resolve that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr panic is from people that are taking your fast smell the three\nOh I'm getting the feedback you know I've got people that email me here's an

wasn't a shred of corroboration and it had taken place thirty six years ago with a high school\n\nIt should never have been hurt and not come because women's voices should not\nBe hurt\nBut because you can't interrupt the the workings of the American government because one person somewhere says something about to say was a man\nLet's say a guy said he abused me when we were in high school you

there is a way for me to help my abs families eliminate owing anything to a PS\nYou're going to produce all the power you need for your home your day your nighttime and a little bit extra\nThere was a deadline that I was talking about in previous weeks August thirty first it was the buyback program anybody that worked with me and got in before August thirty first they had to buy back of twelve point nine for any extra power that they didn't consumed during the day they were sending to a PS is good and they were buying it for twelve point nine\nA PS apparently four hundred and eighty eight million dollars isn't enough for them so they're now dropping that under review with the Arizona corporation commission you think they're going to get the approval of course they are down from twelve point nine to all of them points that it has not been enacted yet I cannot guarantee that\nUm even if today you got if I got your application and with a PS you're going to get the twelve point nine but yet in before they take the lump in point six cents away from us completely\nSo any extra power you're exporting back to the grid its monetary credit on your bill not a kilowatt hour credit a monetary credit so those killer credits are starting to produce a monetary credit on your bill\nCovers these taxes and your nighttime power so at the end of the year I have many of my families that are going to have checks back one thousand two thousand maybe even more back at the end of this year so again\nSo you are locked into your own rate of between seven and half and eat and have since ... daytime nighttime that will be you know you're you're you're on ... on the off peak power that you're producing on your roof will be arranged between seven and a half an eight and ... cents per kilowatt\nIf you go to a passes website and are familiar with those those refunds right now there is no rape plant on a pits as well say or ... either that offers your power on peak or off peak at a guaranteed rate of seven and half the eight and ... cents per kilowatt that locks you win for the next twenty five thirty years\nThat's the only way that you can lock in your own power prices by producing it yourself and not being subject to\nFuture and there's going to be more of them many more of them and things like prop one twenty seven is going to impact our costs a PS\nAs opposed to this the reason they're opposed to this they're up already pencil into their um their their operating costs fifty nine hundred megawatts of natural gas plant\nWhich there's they're going to make a lot of profit on building the natural gas plants they do not want to add solar onto their operating costs because that's a reduced\nNumber of reduced a profit to them so of course are opposed to it because we've already got the rates are approved over the next X amount of years based on those operating expenses so atheist as opposed to it so but it's just ...\nAnd again I'm not recommending to anybody for it or against it at this point because there's too many changes that are continuing to come down the pike and until I really know what to recommend to people the only thing that I can recommend is the only way that these kinds of things are not going to affect your individual families and helpful\nEight hundred Seventy three eighty five that's eight hundred Seventy three eighty

J. C. on top of that pat ... news of all today we're giving away free bottle of OJ seated everybody in the listening audience\nNow purity isn't saying that they're organic juice twins can fix everything

how hot juicy news these days in OJ sea is really organic juicing made simple\nSo tell everybody about the organic juice clans and why you call it a quote unquote game changer\nOh yeah absolutely well we know that you sing is sweeping the nation we know it's super healthy\nBut the problem is you know it's messy and it's a big hassle it takes a long time buying the produce the clean them and that's

broccoli spinach parsley barley grass wheat grass raspberry strawberries all organic I mean this sounds first of all delicious and super healthy\nAll right I mean juicing let's face it it's a great idea\nBut I don't like using commercial produce that's Laden with pesticides herbicides and phones hard I mean I Want to concentrate\nUp the vitamins and minerals antioxidants\nFighter nutrients but I

in fact according to the journal of the American diabetics association\nOnly five percent of us are getting enough fiber that's a disaster because fiber promotes healthy bowel movement you know you need to have a bowel movement at least one today that's critical you have to clean out their GR track but on top of that fiber motel the cholesterol levels\nTriglycerides blood sugar Patty promoting healthy body weight many people when they start adding fiber to their diet they actually drop a few pounds and pretty common\nIt promotes digestion it promotes absorption of nutrients it even reduces bad breath and body odor so fiber\nIs an all around great thing to have\nThe USDA the American Heart Association the national Cancer Institute they all promote getting more fiber and if you're not getting enough fiber OJ's she has a full five grams of both soluble an insoluble fiber you eat the food extract the nutrients and then you want to get the waste\nOut of your system rapidly that's what
