culture or politics um it's it's just the Tour de force in one night read [noise] uh I mentioned that because he has an op ed in the wall Street Journal today which I Want to talk about the moments\nBefore I Do that let me uh reiterate um the two questions I'm interested in from you\nThe listeners are on the ground are the two questions I have\nIs um just to put it simply as McSally going to win is that your sense the polls have a very close my sense is yes I issued the a copy of that I don't want anyone to be complacent about this\nUm because the Dems are working awfully hard here and I think maybe even doubling down given all the statements that have been coming out from a cinema of recent memory or that they probably thought\nDidn't exist or couldn't be found in any event I think ... gonna win I think she's going to win big but I I Want your sense of the IRS much on the ground if not more so than I Am regardless of whether you want her to win is she going to win\nThe other question I've been asking\nA is how much of your vote\nIt's for congressional race or Senate race how much of the Senate race or how much of your vote is Trump related is Trump I'm weighing in his his agenda is the ... agenda a part of your equation and the vote or are you voting\nA irrespective of Donald Trump and really just on the merits and the merits of the specific candidates I'm I'm just curious robber Rob ... column today about the Trump factor in the election and\nI'm just curious what you think about that um before I get to the go learn to recall them and do all your calls always welcome six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero in Allen is in Phoenix Hi Allan\nHi Chris\nI'm fine I'm sad but I find that's okay I of course the person I don't\nDisagree on march and when we do I'm probably wrong and he's probably\nRight now actually to help Trump got much better when she got away\nA lot of other um I was on the road right now but I was watching some of the\nEvent is really smart guy but probably the worst retail\nI Know right Allen thank you for saying I never said it that way I've always thought and it's totally true he is a smart guy he's a great person to have in the Senate he has a tiger when he's interrogating yes but no he is not a great natural politician no he [laughter] you're totally right about that\nIs the worst [laughter] you\nKnow it does have some people just they shouldn't be what they you know they shouldn't they should be authentic and you know maybe that is him in its authenticity but you're right he's just not I I I totally sympathize with um a lot of my friends and obviously a lot of\nListeners who said you know Cruz was their first choice in the primaries [noise] um I I totally get that argument I don't think he could have won the presidential election\nWant anything I look at him and you go to rich products for years politician is that there are a product mhm they have to learn how to sell the product when they start listening to the doctor who try to get their product out of it yeah [laughter]\nAnd he\nKnew he was going to go nowhere in a primary\nWell he he went he he ran up he ran ... coming in second and nothing but I Will tell you I just I I I Know what you mean and you're right he is not a great candidates but he is a great senator\nAgree yeah hell yeah guy you know a lot of ways which would have been a good President Trump but he was he was not a retail politician\nI yeah maybe I don't I don't know I don't know but I Will tell you what's interesting to me to watch 'em I've become [laughter] yeah I have a lot of mixed views on the Romney question but regardless I I'll tell you what what has fascinated me is how quickly\nSomeone like Trump figured out how to work a crowd [laughter] 'cause I didn't know what kind of retail politician he would be I knew he had good name brand I knew I knew how to market things as you said\nBut boy you put them in front of a big crowd he's he he knows how to work that crowd\nAnd the thing about is that people can be in a New Yorker and he knows that we were still on television he understood\nAnd people didn't understand that it's like Hillary terrible retail is you've got to that's why one because he was\nYou know what's also funny about that Alan it's just fun to talk about a little bit it's what's funny about that\nIs for how many years even before he was in politics people would say Trump you know when he was nowhere near politics even put just you know famous in his business dealings in book writings and stuff how much people would say he needs a makeover he needs a choreographer he needs you know he needs a consultant a fashion consultant\nUm he he didn't have the right I mean again the authenticity thing really does matter\nMatter people totally you know even though he's a billionaire billionaire doesn't that you're supposed to do that yeah you know if you want to him\nA lot of both because she shows up with this big old name on the side of that thing proud of it you know and it actually was it was a big eight and a lot of different places like that you know airline that Hillary in with a bunch of people and you know\nHe ... he understood something natural about America too which is you know and he goes to you know whether he was putting his name on buildings are on his airplanes or whatever he understood something about America which is you know most people I mean they're default is is is to want to be a part of success\nYou know their default is to want to be a part of something that is successful\nOr whether it's you know a good school name a good brand name or a good you know or or a famous property name he understood that it made sense in the world which is why he I think also\nUnderstood the magic of make America great again you know ... ... ... why would you be opposed to making America great again you want it to be lousy again I mean you know he understood the billions of that\nAnd that's the that's the argument that Democrats and the crazy left it oh if you're using some of the regulations on your dirty or either or just for stand it\n[laughter] yeah yeah yeah yeah well you know um we like to\nPoint out that the department of education was basically created Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty has education gotten better or worse in America since then\n... the the question I had a question answers itself right [laughter] I don't really look\nAt the beach up back in the late ...\nSure what\nYou want an interesting statistic you want an interesting little fact teen sixty five was the high watermark for SAT scores than America\nWow that was the best year on record for SAT scores Nineteen sixty five\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Know I

even know that story was this you know just on both I mean unbelievable bass bass\nBass grading is a doctor abortion clinic and nobody's heard about it nobody knows who he is and the main reason for that was in fact it was a portion goes for me to our subject but subject\nAnd the left leaning media was just as soon not have a spotlight\nOn and on top of that he was black\nSo\nThose two factors alone I think the reason why we nobody really knows that much about it and that's what's happening in in the Saudi situation is just outraged by the media about this journalist quote unquote was killed\nAnd then you had a Americans were killed and they were just as soon as I\nGot a spotlight on it at all\n[noise] Steve there is so much and everything you just said I'm a ... there's a I'd like

guiding light but I think it's more of a ... than a think here I think it's more of a boxer or a pro wrestler than it is a constitutional scholar\nAnd that's kind of a sad thing because we have to fight that\nWe have to fight that in our elections were used to fighting a decent people were used to fighting in a politics of decency\nAnd we are now forced to fight in a new arena arena we're not used to fighting and um it was an arena Donald Trump understood and I think it explains some of the reluctance for Republicans to support Donald Trump quite frankly I think they didn't understand the way he was fighting and the way he was punching and you may not like it\nBut I'll tell you a I like the result and B I shudder to think about what this place would look like under the leadership of below sea or Schumer or Hillary Clinton it's frightening\nAnd it's frightening to me not just because of their style but because of where their policies have moved to and what their politics have moved to remember when Reagan for example just on the Amazon issue of the economy nevermind social policy just take\nThe economy Reagan have large majorities Simpson at some houses he didn't control why was that because people with names like Gore and Kerry once upon a time could support that agenda because of supported our economy\nNow it's just all about raw political power for them and to hell

number six zero to five\nZero eight zero nine six zero does delighted to welcome Jessica Vaughan\nTo there was a Phoenix she's the director of policy studies at the center for Immigration Studies a lot of people have been calling recently asking what do you do about this caravan what can the administration actually do\nUm first of all I'm not calling it a caravan I'm calling it a mobile mob but we have to turn to the experts that expert is Jessica thanks for joining us Jessica really appreciate it\nThank you for having me glad to\nBe with you betcha thank you All right so to that question take it any way you want what can the administration do should this mob get to Arizona southern border [noise]\nWell I it would be better if they did not get to our southern border I'm at so that's why I think the the first thing that we should be doing is\nA working with Mexico to break it up okay um and at some can apply for asylum in Mexico um we should re start a successful operation from about Eighteen years ago called operation bought found what we cooperated with the Mexican immigration authorities and those who had no\nPermission to be in Mexico were deported and sent home a ... and not that us immigration officers can make arrests in Mexico but we can help them sure and we can make them you know make it more likely that they would want to help I shot through our other bilateral leverage\nI Would tickets in their interest I mean I Can't imagine outside of a political power play that it is in their interest to have teams of not thousands and thousands of of uh immigrants illegal or from other countries are their surrounding countries\nThat's exactly right and and it's not in their interest to have a really really mad at them either [laughter] not a good way to start a new administration and um you know I think that that ah that they would cooperate with us on that they've done it before and they don't want to become a um you know\nThat well I I think that um American support having legal immigration but they they want illegal immigration to be slowed to a tiny trickle and to do that there's a A R border agencies need more resources we need\nA we need some more wall and we need the resources to patrol those places where a wall doesn't make sense\nBut but even a huge even if we walled off the entire northern and southern border it's not going to help as long as we're letting people come in to\nClaim asylum who don't deserve better and not going to\nQualified for it so we need to fix this catch and release policy um that allows people to exploit our system and and that is probably going to have to be done by Congress or perhaps the courts but we can author deterring illegal immigration by um perhaps starting\nTo impose a tax on remittances to people are spending back home yes we can we need to have either verify across the country as is\nAlready in place in Arizona that's right and we need the discouraged sanctuary policies because all of these things ... the prospect of employment or you know being protected from deportation are things that entice people to come and so we've got to get rid of those\nAre things that are the poll factors and\nOf course over the long term you know these countries have to you know offer something to their own people but you know that's not something the United states can solve on it though and we need to fix our policies that are drawing people here\nAnd you're you're not a a partisan organization but it does seem to me a that this is a series of policies but not so long ago many in the Democratic party I no not ... the Republican Party isn't even United on some of this but it seems to me many of the Democratic party would have supported that there could be\nI don't know if it's in a better world or with bitter arguments are just better congressmen and senators\nThere could be some bipartisan action on this could they're not\nThey're actually they're definitely could be and many Democrats have already supported all of the policies\nAs long as they were attached to a massive amnesty and that's really the sticking point is that\nThe Democrats these days you know are the party or that their priority is an amnesty starting with a an amnesty for the people with DACA and so\nYou know but but offering and to even discussing these and if these guys inspire people to come in illegally to try to get in and benefit from the ... the or at least\nWe have one because we actually\nDo have one factor right right and yeah that's right\nAnd so I'm ... you know we need to to fix the enforcement pieces before we even start talking about amnesty again\nHow much do you think or estimate that we lose on the remittances shoe alone [noise]\n[noise] oh that's a good question and we don't know exactly right we know that I'm billions go out of this country in remittances but a lot of them are sent\nPeople who are legal immigrants\nShore so we don't really know really good way to attract that\nRight but we should but the state of Oklahoma has figured out a good way to do it\nAnd they tax the remittances that people who do not file tax returns showing legal income state of Oklahoma uh-huh and uh so that's how\nYou know they come up with a proxy for it and and I think this is something that should be introduced nationwide it would deter illegal employment and give us more resources for border security and immigration enforcement um in fact in Arizona a congressman as introduce something just like this Mr Big\nSmiles held us right exactly right now he's ... he's been wonderful on this issue\nAnd just because I can just take one advantage one more question for me because it's a question the callers have and I know there are some legal issues with it I've discussed some of them before but you know the experts someone said well why can't the president just deployed the national guard there to solve the problem it's not exactly how it works right\nThat's right and you know the national guard has been very helpful but the problem is if they can't make a raft that's all they can do is support the border patrol and and and that's helpful it definitely has been a good thing to have them there and we may need them are even more of them for the short term crisis\nI don't doubt the governor's by the way of the state of Texas and Arizona", "show_name":
