Reeves far more left wing things than he acted on even though he was pretty darn left wing\nAnd occasionally we got insights into that and I think I Would say the way Hillary's internal temperature is and has raised she's\nA little bit of a couple of quick to the right of that just because she has had certain\nDifferent kinds of experiences in trainings and she saw you know what her husband ... needed to do to be a two term\nPresident and I you know it's a slightly different ideological radar system inside but having said that we both know that personnel is policy and that there would\nBe you know no daylight\nBut to me you know Iraq Obama and Hillary Clinton's administration except to the degree that it might even have been more left wing because the Democratic party itself has become more left wing of the last ten years\nNo question and I think\nIt daylight between the two of them as their differences um took to the left or to the right or whatever it you know the fact of the matter is what it comes to promoting\nAgenda and making it will you know for whatever let's say they're trying to\nImplement yeah he just said yeah\nBut it may even be more left just given as I say the staffing around her has been you know the younger the Democrat the more left wing the Democrat over the last you know ten Fifteen twenty twenty five years so I ... possible\nYou know he he may have had more adults in the room and she would have if you will you know it's a fair point I I I take it and I don't think we disagree much\n[noise] so are are very slow progress\nWorks pretty good

they can get away with saying what they're saying what their smoke [noise]\nWith their smoke brief analysis you know I mean it's it's just look I'm I I don't know if you watch Megan ... she just had Jonathan Turley on well known law professor from GW George Washington university\nNot not a conservative and he said on Martha and kill him he said I just would not be as confident as the left is that Donald Trump is on the wrong side of this argument when you look at a history it's at least adequate probable at least that he's got it right and probably more so\nWell I Believe that you know the Condon okay not that they're not constitutional as they're not you know professors and it just doesn't fit their narrative if they were to ... ... actually sit there and explain\nAll the reasons why that small phrases in there and why it's there then you would they would have to say exactly what you just that it's possible that he's right\nIt's at least possible oh what bothers me Larry more than anything is not the pundits it's the it's the anchor is you know the shepherd Smith should the Gayle King\nFor and not just tea but the entire Republican Party according to an op ed in the Washington Post today for creating the conditions that lead to the massacre in Pittsburgh what did he say or to lead to the attack\nIn Pittsburgh and for not doing enough or saying enough about it he goes there today with his wife\nPlacing um rocks traditional rocks on the on the memorial sites of of of the people who were being buried\nAnd the mayor of Pittsburgh the mayor of Pittsburgh says he shouldn't be there right you shouldn't be there now to put that into sharp relief who the heck said that about Bill Clinton in Oklahoma City bombing\nSo you ask who would ever change will it ever end I had hopes when Donald Trump was elected based on we were talking a few segments ago you may have heard we were talking about the internal ideological compasses of bronco Obama and Hillary Clinton I\nKnow think about the ideological compass of Donald Trump you know this was not the most conservative man on that Seventeen or Eighteen person primary stage\nDomains find no means we'll see the most conservative by no means was he in the top I don't know ten for the most conservative and indeed for those of us with a memory that runs a little bit longer than a day ago\nYou will recall that at least Seventy to eighty percent of the never Trump Republican movements concern was that he would not govern conservatively [noise]\nUm that was the big concern for most of them [noise] um the rest of the percentage I think had to do with style but that having been said I thought when he got elected that we would come to a kind of\nOr move in the direction kind of a post partisan red blue um cutthroat everything the Republicans do is racist everything the Democrats do is heaven on earth\nI thought we might get there because you know he he is not instincts Julie right winger instinct surely conservative he's you know Bill Buckley William buckle used to have a test or at least an analysis of candidates who were Republican ... and it was kind of an interesting test he would say\nWell there's a difference between I'm a conservative and conservative he's not a conservative but he's conservative right that was that was that was the tests Ronald Reagan was a conservative Donald Trump is not a concern so I thought we might\nGet into some kind of place where everything he did or said wasn't filtered through the lens of um boy this sounds like David Duke all over again which is what we're getting from so you ask\n... when will it ever and I don't know if I don't know my friend Ryan Williams president of Claremont Institute I had him on a couple weeks ago on based on a column he wrote\nSaying it it won't end perhaps when we have a really decisive victory a really decisive victory meaning you know not only do we have the house and Senate and the White House but you know we showed them up pretty\nBig in them in terms to just show them how out of touch they are at a certain point maybe they go into a self reflect mode\nUm it has happened in our memories you know who did that Bill Clinton did that Bill Clinton went into self reflect mode\nAnd tried to govern more towards the center um first of all he ran towards the center to to to win the election yes um and I think it's worth remembering for all those people who like to say Donald Trump didn't get a majority of the popular vote I think it's worth remembering\nNeither Joe Clinton but that having been said you know he he he brought in Dick Morris ... capital gains taxes he reformed welfare um he performed a criminal or our criminal laws and and that sort of thing towards ... so you know it's happened\nIt's happened because we we as a country said we're we're just not doing the McGovern thing anymore it's just it doesn't work [noise] so\nWhat what what what motivation do Democrats have to stop ... their their screening louder and louder kicking on the floor like like a child that they didn't get their way\nWell let's take another six yeah no it to you raise a great point and and and I'm kind of thinking out loud as I'm Talking but it takes a couple adults in the party to say this isn't working for us anymore and will will be consigned to you know the ash sheep of the week party or something\nBy but here's the problem with that I mean every answer has a problem the problem with that\nIs that the adults have become um you know part of the asylum I used to think Dianne Feinstein was one of the adults for example\nYou know and she's just as much a part of the problem is everyone else if not in many cases more so um so I don't know who the adults in the party are I really don't\nFunniest of all things was pointed out on this to me by my friend's heavy Troy when we were talking about you know Democrats who are dyed in the wool Democrats liberals intellectuals um but you know somewhat somewhat responsible Democrats they don't cry racism every time someone uses the word to be it\nA year and you know what people like William golfed and he's a good example of them um he's based at the Brookings Institute anyway ... point was notice where they right they write for the wall Street Journal\nWell they they can't find they can't find pages in liberal out but so I Do it it may just be something\nWe have to ... for a date and keep pushing and fighting every single day you know Ronald Reagan had that line\nHe used over and over again first occurred in Phoenix first set\nIn Phoenix that you know freedom is not something we passed down to the generations to our bloodstream we have to fight for every single day and ... may be what we have to do he may just have to fight it every single day she may\nHave a light around here but you're not going anywhere and I'm not going anywhere so you know call it a labor of love [noise]\nI mean it is about something we care about the law

of course the media\nLast no time interesting that there's a connection between Trump's so called hateful rhetoric and what happened in Pittsburgh indeed what happened with respect to the pipe bomber\nCan we um\nAnalyze that are searching for just a second [noise] was there ever administration that spoke more harshly against the police and the Obama administration [noise] here's a G Eric Holder\nArgued that the fact that a black criminal defendant who commits a crime compared to a white criminal defendant who commit similar crime gets a longer sentence and that's true the U.S Simpson commission says a black from the defendant versus a white cream defend it gets mentioned about twenty two percent longer\nWithhold or didn't tell you is that the very same sentencing commission to which he referred also said the reason for the longer sentences is at the average black criminal defendant compared to the average white from defended his more arrests\nAnd judges take arrest into consideration when there's tremendous and so the U.S into commission to which Eric Holder refer to making the argument that the longer sentences\nOr an example of quote pernicious racism quote unquote failed to mention that the same commission also said the reason for the longer sentences has to do with legitimate factors\nRecall of course President Obama said that if I had a son he would look like Trayvon I Know George Zimmerman was not a cop but he was operating as a\nNeighborhood watch captain Obama in his speech\nBefore the United nations invoked Ferguson and said something to the effect of you know we've got our own problems here in the United states with a place called ... in their hands up don't shoot was a complete and total lie\nAnd while the Obama administration completely exonerated the officer in question they also hold the Ferguson police department institutionally racist why well the biggest finding was that the to the Ferguson is about to be some ... percent black\nYet about eighty five percent of those who are stopped on traffic stops are black a gap of what Eighteen percent or go after Eighteen points or go racism the problem with that argument is that as I said before\nCity of New York about twenty five percent of its population is black about fifty five percent of those who were stopped on traffic stops complex dirty point gap\nFerguson police department almost all white per year for cops were black the NYPD street cops majority of them are people of color\nWhy isn't the NYPD if the gap between population a percentage of those stop by cops is an example of institutional racism why is the New York city twice if institutionally racist as ...\nAnd the answer is you can't do it based on just those numbers you have to look at what underlies

against them die you have a lot of those messages that can be said over again that's meaningful to your list are you\nWell actually you know I I started a joint working group on religious freedom when I was to set a Democrat Republican and we looked\nAt a lot of anti Semitism around the world and and\nAnd frankly in this country and let's just be honest I mean around the world most the anti Semitism comes from two places that comes from the Muslim world yeah and\nIt comes in Europe than it is or if it's not a Christian and he said it's a very secular\nA pro Palestinian and it's also it's a lot of it's centered around a around Israel\nAnd some of it you know ... you know there is there are all over the neo Nazi types in in Europe that that are still around so but here in this country up until what we've seen here recently most of what we used to I I've I've seen with respect to anti Semitism has really been on the left\nThat ended in what I said I'll college can't yup been on college campuses is again a lot of it related to Israel a but it is is clearly not you know there are neo Nazis in this country the neo Nazis and in Europe\nAre not saying they're not there and obviously this man was isn't neo Nazi and as a as an anti Semite of the worst kind but let's not throw all these instances of increase in a in an anti Semitic behavior and say oh those are All right wing folks they're not\nThey're not and ah you know I I was um I have been loudly asking for Democrats mainly um with the last name Clinton\nTo denounce the fact that Bill Clinton could Glenn handle and back slap and sit on a stage with one of the biggest anti Semite in this country not a month ago Lewis Farah can I don't know how that has in any way become acceptable or that no one wants to say anything about this\nUm yesterday Ben and Jerry's announces a new flavor of ice cream or in the name of the resistance to Donald Trump and they say they're going to give twenty five thousand dollars to lend us our sewer\nSo organization these are two of the greatest anti Semite stocking the country right now ... they are comfortably on the left and respected by the left\nWell here let me I'll throw another one there's a there's a bill that was introduced in the in in the house\nOr a chart forty three Ninety One I don't know if you're familiar with this but it's it's the title is promoting human rights by ending Israel detention Palestinian children to go and it and it and it goes through and talks about how\nHow how Israel is torturing children yeah I mean you don't you don't want to talk about it I mean I there were so many folks out there who are\nYou know and in that spot at countries many of them on the left in central and South America court torturing people and doing all sorts of horrible thing but what thirty Democrats in the house back on that they're going to Israel yeah uh and it and why do you pick on Israel I've been doing\nThis you pick on Israel because you're an anti Semite I mean let's just be honest about it I mean there there and that that's what's going on here and it's it's very much under the table\nIt's very real there is no other country in the world in the world where people can respectively stand up and say it doesn't have a right to exist except Israel\nThat is the definition of anti Semitism no one is standing up and saying Pakistan doesn't have a right to exist and find credible and respectable clubs on college campuses or anywhere in the U.S house or Senate\nWhere that can be agreed to and say well that's fine that's that's not anti Pakistani that's not anti Muslim that's just a normal talk Israel's the only country people can comfortably stand up and say doesn't have a right to exist\nAnd you're you're getting package at all sorts of ways but it comes down to the bottom line\nThat this is just as an issue with Jews and you know the reality is that you know American jewelry which unfortunately represented some water in it for all of the left who are Jews but are frankly the left before the June\nYes and I tried that as their religion left ism is their religion Judaism is not their religion but\nIt's like you saw those who are more Orthodox Jews or practice teachers and that was a very different response as far as it is very different response to\nWhat's going on here and and to me it it it it it shows that you have to stand up and fight\nFor their self actually did out an article today by on another radio talk shows a friend of mine from Iowa names on that July well actually ... right after the press that the ban on like the title of the two thousand fourteen I put together a group of Christians and Jews but we we said we would\nGet on the first flight we caught Israel to show that it was safe to fly to Israel and Israel during wouldn't Hamas\nBombing rockets into Israel and you know Simon ... fan you know he said look you know\nThe idea of having protection at a synagogue someone carrying a gun at us and I got this is not something that we should be a foreign to this is this is the reality frankly at a lot of churches America Christian churches in America where people do that and obviously every synagogue in Israel\nAs someone a vote on it there because of the reality of what we're dealing with and that's just we have to get real here about France and we have to deal with them but Charlie and I think you know that that's what many in the George ... more well\nI think you're absolutely right Rick and yeah as you say it's too bad but\nUm ... you know they do it in Israel and the calls for this had been going on in America for a very long time and there's there's there's absolutely nothing wrong with it we see it or what churches and we used to live and he said\nYou go to any yeah you go to any Jewish community center or or any any Jewish led organization you\nHave security have you have when you have all sorts of security protocols why because unfortunately there continue to be a source of why would a synagogue be any different that's right and I'm from Texas and like you do every other jokes organization\nThat said Zachary right and if those security barriers weren't there if those armed guards weren't there maybe you would see more violence they have a deterrent effect Rick you have great effect than I Would love I just couldn't resist calling you today

to this hour because I Love it when I have not only a friend but a man any person I tremendously respect are able to\nI'm into the studio delighted to have with us a doctor Steve Ferrara he is a candidate for Congress in congressional district nine which is not only where I live but where I work where nine sixty am broadcast from it's an interesting district tea is I'm\nA war vet he is a practicing physician and he is running to represent us and take the seat that has been held\nBy cure ... cinema one of the things I was telling you that I Love about Dr Ferrara is he is so accessible he understands truly what it means to be a representative he understands that he is representing people and the sea is accessible I don't think\nHe'll correct me if I'm wrong I don't think there's ever been a media interview he was asked to be on that he has said no to or made conditions on an whenever I've had him um unlike a lot of politicians or a lot of people running for office because I don't think of you as a politician and save a\nUsed no holds barred calling on any question you want you are here\nTo represent people you're a big enough person to run for Congress you're a big enough person to take a call on any question there are no preconditions I Love that about you the only um the only thing about free conditions that you have something to say about has to do with health care and we'll talk about that in a moment but let me give the number and reintroduce you six zero to\nFive zero eight zero nine six zero five days to go how's it looking Dr Steve\nIt's looking great uh the enthusiasm the momentum is tremendous you know I think it's great to be running as a Republican in two thousand Eighteen because if you look at the trajectory of the country in the past two years it's exciting I'm\nYou know you and I are similar age we've talked about this before on this show so you know we sort of came of age during Ronald Reagan this time and and so even you know as a youngster you remember getting our confidence back you know coming out of the seventies was such a\nDifficult time and Reagan made us proud to be Americans made us feel good to be Americans\nAnd that's what back you know I mean people are working in record numbers we have people of every ethnicity every walk of life\nJust you know pouring back into the workforce you see optimism again you see you know it was just what was a two or three years ago right you know before this administration began that when they did those surveys and asked do you think you're going to be better off than your parents and it was we were under water yeah\nThe American dream was in trouble then that's not the case now people feel they're going to be they can do better than their parents which is what it's all about\nSuch an important point because it's reversible\nReversible the wrong vote can reverse this you can vote for the party that wants to reverse all of this and they're and they're both about it they are saying we will get rid of the tax cuts which have led to this tremendous growth they are saying they will put the IRS\nBack into our health care decisions they are saying they will a weekend the strengthened border and the stronger us a sovereignty that we appreciate all of this is up for grabs\nIt's amazing that we're not going to run the table I Hope we do but the mere fact that we probably are certainly across the country we won't when we're running on prosperity on optimism on growth on the American dream and the other side is running on ... that's right\nHas tag resist resist all of the good that we have seen over the last he has all the things that you could make better have been made better I in fact I don't know what's been made worse when you look across the scene internationally nationally domestically I Can't think of anything that's gone worse\nNow I really can't date of our rhetoric perhaps the state of the political discourse I I\nWas listening to a piece this morning and someone played a collage of soundbites from just within the past day or so and the rhetoric from the mainstream media\nYou know the amount of times they invoked Nazi is um or Hitler you know that used to be a real taboo for both sides ... we didn't talk about because we said it's\nIt was just actually especially distinctive evil that you know become normalized and now ... and it's\nJust and that is actually broadening the divide and what we're talking about here is bringing people back together and that's what I think again when we bring people back you know again one of the reasons as you know south I Love my career in the military so much\nBecause it was such a great equalizer and do when you come in and you go to boot camp or officer training guess what everybody's getting their head shaved everybody's wearing the same clothes it didn't matter whether you came from the suburbs of the inner city the\nFarm you kept the head shape I Know when I see\n[laughter] you know I just started to own it [laughter]\nDr Ferrara by the way your website for our for Congress dot com for people who want to help out you started I you've launched a new ant today which uh blew me away Oh thank you the perspective you start with tell stories ... ... ... it's nothing I thought about before honestly and you do it\nYou know it just it was a very organically I'm inspired ad sitting with my team and we're kind of you know coming up with a week to go and you were going to come out with a new ad this week\nAnd one of the women on my team who as again as we all know is a big battle ground in the electorate so this is what resonated with her she said you know Steve you should\nMake an ad where you tell that story you tell him and the stories about\nYou know my daughter Madeleine our oldest child was born in two thousand one right before nine eleven and and when I relate this you know and I I think about a deeply personally is very personal story when the twin towers remember when nine eleven occurred I Know your listeners you know many of us you know remember\nThat like it was yesterday we knew the world was change and we knew we were entering a new book of\nOf politics and geopolitics we weren't exactly sure what then I had this brand new baby and so I remember as a new father thinking to myself what is the world's gonna be like for this child of mine and now when I fast forward to today\nAnd now one is Seventeen so next year she can fight in the same or that her dad fought and\nThat's really something else we've never had anything like that in American history\nNow her generation our generation but really hurt the years she was born Pearl Harbor you know a really a there are a couple events where people have about how he was on our air soil and we are still\nYou know we still have sons and daughters going into harm's way people here in CD nine are committed in their sons and daughters\nAnd some of whom will give as Abraham Lincoln described at the last full measure of devotion and that is something that to me is that alone I always say if there was only one\nReason I was running for Congress to give those people a voice I think that would be enough I Would be very satisfied with that is that has the reason I you know I'm also of course running on health care and the economy and in many other a\nWhole host of things that we can do for that alone would doubt alone because that especially because you know as I think we both\nAre our daughter who was born the year of nine eleven could be fighting in the same or you fought\nThat's right I mean when I went there in two thousand nine and I did I think that that wasn't even going to be the halfway mark yeah that's a great that was ten that was nine years ago\nThat's that's a great point to one of the things I have to highlight and ah will open our lines up and just a second for anyone that wants to ask you a question one of the things I have to highlight is a year and a competitive race or you're in a tough race is no question about are all almost all races have to be considered tough these days I'm your opponent\nWon't do interviews no\nEuropol you you have never said no to an interview request whether it be on a liberal platform or conservative I've seen you on the liberal platforms I'm told there was another radio station on the FM dial that's considered a little bit left\nWing government in doubt I'm told this exist you know there you go there when they go anywhere where you're at on both sides absolutely so there's a political new show one of the biggest political TV shows in in our state is a ... ... ... ... newsmakers Saturday\nMaker Saturday I used to be ... in our\nBrain John hook a long time moderator I I mean he's he's been moderating ... political election and debates for at least Thirty years here in Arizona they invited you on with your opponent your opponent wouldn't show that's where I wouldn't even return the call wouldn't even return the call\nWhich is at a minimum we talk about when we talked about civility in politics I think returning somebody's phone call in any\nHow do you protect preexisting conditions you are I mean one of the great things about your candidate she is one of the main issues I think maybe the most important issue to people's health care well you've been a health care provider for what Thirty years\nYeah along so I was just how do you project how to protect you know so what I talk about all the time is that we take care of people with preexisting conditions currently we just do it in the most inefficient way possible because what we do is we subject people to a situation where they have to become extremely ill\nThan they make a nine one one called an ambulance ride an ER visit a\nHospitalization maybe an icy used here and emergency surgery and then a prolonged hospitalization and ... rehab the patient doesn't do well because there are of course not going to have as good of an outcome\nAnd they can never pay the bill and there's no prevention and there's no prevention to the taxpayer bears that cost after the fact ex post facto so I simply say look why don't we have a moment of clarity here and say\nWe're paying for that in the most inefficient way let's move those dollars to the front of the line and let's make sure patients are giving the prevention of getting the medications they need you know people who can afford insurance can certainly pay it but people who cannot are going to be helped to just like their help now except there helps\nAfter they already have had a catastrophic illness and potentially a family hardship so we're moving it to the front of the law and we're taking care of things prospectively that patients have a better outcome the tax payer it's more economically responsible\nThat dollar prevention is worth ten dollars of treatment easily any day of the week I notice in drug prevention work out you know it's true in all health care I\nSound so lately and so it's again\nIt's common sense principles what you know I think one of the biggest themes of this is we're bringing common sense when we saw we've seen that's what we're doing with the economy right a lot of what we're doing the G imagine\nIf you give a dollar to the government do you think you'll get a dollar back no but if you give a dollar to a small business owner to an American\nYou know you you might get three dollars four dollars five dollars back right so that's what we're doing with tax cuts right that's why our economy is growing that's where we have a great economic growth rate because we're doing things that we know work that makes sense as opposed to thinking that one size fits all top down government led intervention is going to ever\nMake people better off we have never seen that work it's not going to work\nIf the Democrats take over and they instilled that we're going to be right back where we were ... people like Larry Summers saying well this is the new normal secular stagnation so we can we can do so much better\nI I I I I've heard you and your campaign talk about your common sense conservative I think you know your um your your
