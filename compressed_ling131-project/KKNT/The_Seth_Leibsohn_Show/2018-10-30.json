back Monday October twenty ninth to says an Eighteen reduced Seth leaps and show it but it's just because it's\nGot my name on it and I'm the dial tone for the most part it's your show whatever's on your mind and uh we're here for that we stumbled into an interesting conversation about and I don't know if it was in part inspired by\nOur guest from wings for warriors and part of it might have been inspired by some of the thoughts were all having these will be the caravan\nA or mobile mob is I'd prefer to call it some of it might have been inspired about the letter from George Washington I read to the Jewish congregation in Rhode Island which I Believe was the first time in history a leader of a government openly wrote in a positive fashion\nTo a Jewish community um but it got us into the whole notion of I'm teaching American what is an American and Mike is in Phoenix with a thought on that Hi Mike\nOh yes thanks for taking my call of course\nUm I called in a few different times I think a couple of years ago and um have your clay and it played a a a John Wayne hyphenated American\nUh-huh and I think it might be a good time to get you very well\nKind of appropriate seeing how we've got a mob coming over the border yeah invaders and also that election coming up or maybe a ... shed a little different light on on what are people that are running for senator actually believe\n... you know it's a good point Mike let me let me throw a thought out to you that just\nKind of came to me as well I'm having a lot of first thoughts today based on colors especially college named Mike it seems like [laughter]\n\nBut um let me let me try it let me let me try this out on your um\nIt's been a parent to a lot of\nUs that for a good generation or more now Thirty years or more\nPatriotism has become a down market commodity it's seen as kind of up by the culture it's kind of seen as\nAs the um [noise] uh what ... is something for the ... cultured something for you know on the on TALK to the non intellectual\nKind of a refuge if you will um [noise] the patriotic or the or the or the cousins with a with the yellow teeth and the and the dirty shirts you bring to the Thanksgiving table you know\nJust kind of a kind of a second rate person as the Patriot these days it's it's it's just gotten such a\nSuch a such a bad rap you saw some of this over the NFL thing you see it from time to time it just keeps popping up that uh the patriots are the ones who who are um to be shunned but isn't it ought that those who should\nKnow marketing in America the most or the best\nAre those you would think who have the highest stakes involved which is those who make political ads political campaign that's when we get to a political\nElection when we get to an election whether it's in a primary or whether it's in a general election as we are going to have in about a week and a day here those people's supposedly know something about what moves Americans\nMoves them to vote moves them to inconvenience themselves to vote moves them to donate money to someone right this is this is the highest kind of advertising you can do the most important kind of advertising can do and they all don't they Democrat or Republican liberal or conservative in their own way\nTry and wrap themselves in a patriotic um ah depiction don't they they they kind of try and prove\nTo the voter that they're the most patriotic or the most in sync with American values I I think I'm right about that again regardless of party isn't that kind of an interesting thing so why does the culture look so down on it when it looks like it really actually does move most people\nYes\nI say something super obvious is that just stupid what I'm saying maybe it is\nNo um [noise] I I think I think that's right however um\nIt's quite quite\nComplicated I Believe I'm In the fact that you've got two different bought two the two different views of that topic um and the people who have captured our education system\nHave our teeth are in their teaching I mean they're they're former communist still a lot of them I mean in the colleges and stuff you know who's the guy that they tried to blow up the Pentagon back in the sixties these are the the\nLow ... someone like that yeah I I Am a ... a professor at Harvard or something like well I Know\nCertain points the University of Illinois maybe even a Chicago at some point or maybe they gave up hello show Harvard it wouldn't surprise me you know there's\nPeople like that teaching our kids ... I mean\nA lot of them um my my wife ah who's a almost sixty went back to school after kids got out of school and a A N took four years and so I Know I Know they're teaching this stuff 'cause she told me mhm and um\n[noise] uh so you know they're they're teaching things that are um a\nSocialist interview and but they call that patriotism mhm they their remaining they're doing is they're taking in there will be maiming everything they're making new meanings for words and and taking over work\nAnd and it's it's confusing a lot of people in that people don't know what to do about it so when these kids grow up\nAnd they you know get to be thirty or whatever and there's running for\nMayor running for this and that dog catcher their fear confused about what true patriotism is and so they go in in there basically\nTeaching socialism you make a good point uh we said the other day um the other day it's been a little longer than that's been maybe a couple of weeks\nThat when the audio for example of Kirsten Sinema saying it's fine with me if you want to join the Taliban go right ahead right she she responded to a reporter asking about that [noise]\nUm when she was she was asked something about you know her views of America her views of the enemy\nAnd then that was compounded by talking about Arizona as the meth lab for democracy in it she said I stand for Arizona I Want to represent Arizona values\nAnd you know that can just be anything you know there's nothing a socialist can't say that wouldn't be an in her view an Arizona but in other words we we have to have an agreement on what the values are otherwise anyway can go ahead and say well ... you know it's an Arizona value to me to give Medicare for all said Arizona\nValue ... to get rid of an air force base in Arizona and I mean right who what Arizona lining the term yeah redefining the yeah the ... it's it\nBut they don't mind cheating and and and then the Republican Party yeah I'm sure there's some people [laughter] that cheap but on a whole are fairly honest and don't want to cheat and and and then on on another\nTopic some on our topic for a second because women are okay go ahead\nGo ahead because because Christian sentiments saying those things but\nBut the media is the the mainstream media is taking that and they're eliminating what she said or they're they're just chopping it off or like order for it took a picture of the Obama and left out a a a what a\nCircle yes it was right in right now right held that vote him out for ... years yes yes yeah for for what eight years before that yeah\nYeah and and did it on purpose but because he knew that it would cause I'm I'm just so so they're they're doing these things and and it and people don't even see it so they can't even they\nCan't even make a wise decision\nYeah no that's a very good point NBC might be an example lately of this it's a slightly well it's a bigger and smaller issue but if you saw the story where NBC held back\nThe story of several witness for the rest of us for a ... a a witness who Michael ... represented one of these people claiming you know Brett Kavanaugh had been part of the you know the gang rape chain gang or whatever they called it ... in it she would\nHave brought them forward\nRight right it was a ... he gave him a witness NBC one to the witness send the witness told NBC baloney I they're putting words in my mouth I never witnessed anything like that and they never aired that even though they interviewed ... client now here's here's the problem says\nWho and this is driven me nuts for driven me nuts for years who who is responsible for punishing the person that told that lie\nWas Trump's rhetoric Trump's heated\nOver the top rhetoric\nAnd does that whole panelists decrying it and talking about how bad it is Max Boot says you have to understand we have an arsonist in the White House\nHow the hell can he decrying to climb over the top irresponsible rhetoric and then in the next breath say you have to understand we have an arsonist in the White House\nAgain it being not only factually inaccurate not only being a crime but it being a crime of violence\nOnce you have turned a leader into a\nCriminal or a violent criminal or Hitler as the left us or compare them to stolen as others have\nSee junior senator from Arizona [noise]\nYou have created the moral conditions for over ... for violent revolution that's exactly what those moral conditions are now I'm not saying anyone is necessarily going to do it\nBut their point is based on Donald Trump's rhetoric people are doing it that their point and his rhetoric isn't nearly as heated\nI think we just need to be spared of these people\nBut how GQ can continue to employ this person I have no idea\nNot if the new standard is making Kelly and if she's an outlier and they just want her to get rid of her than be honest with us be honest with us don't use race as an excuse or racism as an excuse and tarnish or for the rest of her life\nMoney she'll make but money isn't everything in fact we're taught a good name is even better than the price of rubies Alice in Prescott high how\nHey Seth how you do what I think Max Boot there's a great example of that descent of the academic world yeah sure he does not sound like a a disinterested scholar no clues written some books in the past\nYes he has pointed yes I think he's lost his mind I I think he's lost\nHis mind this is this is you know a very you know as you say a high and I'm Bree in sharp and they kinda you know tweed person who's just drooling at the mouth on his Twitter feed about his interactions with Stormy Daniels and Bill Maher I think he's lost his mind\nYeah you know you got to breathe you got the bow tie your story that you have to exactly right

otherwise um would be confined to the ash people's idiocy so you know ... ... Max Boot can say this crazy stuff and you know he might\nThink it's not important or she might not have been sentenced to publish books on it or articles but they're CNN for him to go to and it makes him feel good and it\nGives him an audience of hundreds of thousands of people so it it it kind of self propels and self rewards on the one hand and on the other it puts a a a real hard on a sauna Steve\nTo to to to disassemble the nonsense that that that is preached from there it reminds me of the old the philosopher from um\nEngland or early twentieth century philosopher John Smith so the first task of the educators ... excuse me the first task of the educated just to know when someone is talking rot well it takes a lot of work to explain that what they're hearing is literally Roger\n[noise] sure that's true but you got to keep in mind to their viewership you would I Would agree with that\nYeah the viewers watch yeah they are getting\nInfluenced in that way but the fact

often it's hard to get you know a an\nInterview you know score an interview with a president a senator ... a little less so with a member of the house but still it's hard because they're always afraid

another whole show that takes place over there but the one that involves um pasta in close proximity is right here and do our phone lines are open for you and I've got some questions for each of obviously plenty of things to say but I always couch them in questions for you\nBefore I Begin asking you what you think about some things I'm In a time when so little unifies us I think when we were lashed together on Thursday\nHere on the Larry Elder show I think I went through my usual speech about how unity as for the birds common ground is a is a mess\nAnd in fact we are a better people we are a better government we are a better society when everybody just is true to their beliefs let the conservatives be conservative and fight for conservative things slip the liberals be liberal and fight for liberal things were going to have winners who wins losers who loses what\nThe election is about a week from tomorrow the winters are going to win the losers are going to lose and I've been preaching the conservatives for years\nI don't think you're going to win by trying to reach out to the left us all they're going to do is buy your hands off because they ain't reaching out to us\nAnd nor should say the left should be left if their ideas prevail good for them not so good for the country in my view but the the oldest common ground unity come by on nonsense I is in\nTerms of policy it is ridiculous but I offer that\nAn on ramp to the following there is a short list of things but unified all of us under the umbrella of our humanity or at least should I Wish it were all of us are but there is a a a little tiny sliver of subsection of of humanity and it's seen the underbelly\nThat ah that does things like what we've seen in Pittsburgh and so before we dive in and talk about Pittsburgh before we die didn't talk about the media reaction and political reactions to Pittsburgh let us just pause and do the most important thing we can do as Americans as people\nAnd that is lift up those last people in prayer letters to lift up the soles of those who are shot by this this this monster\nTheir their families their friends their\nFaith community there at the tree of life synagogue it is it is probably it it is sad\nThat it takes thing the only things like that is truly unify us but this is not a policy battle this is not a left versus right thing this is a good versus evil thing\nNow in a minute or you will hear people say that they're in their take on good versus evil they consider the president of the United states to be evil well I'll have a word or two to say about those people but before we before we had them for the various rabbit trails of talk show live\n'em let us just no matter what we are doing\nRight now where I Am here in central time a little after five and the sun is shining it's beautiful warm Texas day\nMaybe you're a little bit into your commute on the east coast maybe in a beautiful vistas of mountain time it's late afternoon and

American society as a whole can no longer with standard just stand this daily negative assault on who we are as the people I Do not believe in my heart of hearts that the American people feel

reality or we showed them are only two years ago\nIn uh uh this time almost this time two years ago and we can do it again or in fact you know I think we're kind of obligated to\nAnd the reason I think we're obligated to is exactly as Elaine has put it um exactly how she put it\nThey clearly think that we all agree with them or if they don't the way they talk to us and where they would say they were wrong if we prove them wrong\nIs that we are all a bunch of misfits or ... or unsophisticated as they are after all you know they believe in the New York times switched to them can be read

that's not the point the point is um\nThe ... the media has become a scandal they have become a re proof and I don't know how anyone without a straight face can say\nOr otherwise um what they've done with the fourteenth amendment issue is a perfectly good example go back and look at what they did I actually have a sound clip it's how long is that thing of the media over the last to its two minutes um let me go to Gary and then do that and I'll just show you what they were about I mean\nI I also found a column I want to share with you about something I said yesterday\nUh yesterday I was talking a little bit about\nHow this isn't the worst of times and it's not close to the worst of times\nAre in our lifetimes generally speaking we have had worse um I think the end days of Watergate were pretty bad but Nineteen sixty eight was\nIn comprehensible to compare us to um there were real\nQuestions in America about whether we could survive I Know will wake up tomorrow fine I Know will wake up a Wednesday of next week fine whatever the outcome I Know will be fine\nAnd I know I won't be second and I won't gain weight over it and I won't want to move to another country regardless of the outcome heck I won't even want to create a new ice cream flavor that gives money to anti Semite have to get to that story too\nAll right Gary did call back Gary thank you right now can you hear me now are good yeah All right yeah [noise] um\nI have heard many times that there was a legal opinion that is the birthright citizenship yes what ... what is that opinion I kind of assumed it was a court case\nYeah I think what most people are talking about is an Eighteen Ninety eight Supreme Court case known as the arc case or the wrong Kim arc case and it had to\nDo with um in that case or as you can imagine Chinese uh in America and basically the birthright citizenship citizenship of a Chinese a\nNational [noise] but it's not on point because they were legal they were legally weren't citizens but they were legal if you will legal immigrants so we don't actually have a Supreme Court case on illegal immigrants\nInteresting yes\nAnd you know this is what is it further interesting to me is you know we have access to this stuff and you know as I said I'm not an expert on the issue I I Try and do what I can I I I ... I assume you're not an expert on the issue but we have we have the ... the journalists to Dane\nTo claim against the president for a fundamental misunderstanding of the fourteenth amendment should know what they're talking about before they say that and it wouldn't take five seconds on Google to simply plug in birthright citizenship fourteenth amendment and they would see that this has been a raging\nDebate for twenty twenty five years with all kinds of scholarship\nAll kinds of scholarships saying exactly what I said in my monologue what President Trump is set on the campaign trail as well as what he said to the political reporters there had been op eds everywhere from the New York times to the Washington Post to the New Republic to you name it on this very very issue it is not\nSettled law that birthright citizenship\nFor illegal aliens the children born here of illegal aliens is is constitutionally settled it is not there has never been litigated [noise] and the best reading we have the fourteenth amendment shows that it was not intended to be this way\nI can I tell you something I'm not very [noise] yes [noise]\nI made it the nation many times have you know something about that subject [noise] like I Know a lot of cars and I read an article or see in a news report they don't\nHave any facts right they did not take it's amazing how much they rely on that we're doing here I realize now that anything I read some other subject\nIf he was such an important point Gary I I Want to say something about it such an important point you are so right be right back [noise]\n[noise] I Can't believe the holidays are almost here again well that's not all the time to\nReview our Medicare plan and see what changes are coming in twenty nine team\nNow not that again that eight hundred number to call for help last year was so confusing and I don't have time to attend to all this meeting\nNot to worry this year we're calling Tina DRP insurance service ... and her team will meet with us answer our questions explain her options and help us make changes the necessary the T R B team is helping people with Medicare in Arizona for over Nineteen years ... be insurance isn't a plus rating with the better business\nBureau you're saying they will actually meet with us and help us Sarah hall this Medicare staff sounds perfect we all deserve or seven so we better call today\nWhat six do two seven five eight eighty nine Ninety eight that six to seven five eight eighty nine Ninety eight or we can reach you on the Web AT T R B insurance\nDot com all services are provided no obligation [noise]\nJohn ... here with your culture and economy tip number four\n[noise]\nWhat do you Jimi Hendrix Picasso Howard Hughes and Abraham Lincoln all have in common [noise]\nThey all died without an estate planning a written estate in retirement plan can't promote confidence and a degree of control over the wealth you've worked hard to accumulate [noise]\nI've been assisting my clients reached the financial goals for over twenty five years and can help you as well call for eight or nine nine one ten fifty five just schedule a complementary financial consultation visitors that Grand Canyon planning dot com like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter again that number is four eight or nine nine one ten fifty five\nI'm John dump rusty reminding you don't run out of money before you run out of time\nSecurity advisors Harris is African climate security that must be a member of than your answer to make an an investment advisor Grand Canyon planning and climate security they're not affiliated\n[noise]\n\nWhat is\nThat Anthony okay you're going to let it flies in Iowa worked for you [noise] she's co hosting\nAs a judge I knew a country singing show so I'm assuming the sensors allowed her to do that you're you're very tough on her here [laughter] take took me everything I had to allow my producer Anthony to let me play ... Twain music here he just thought the FCC might frown on it you\nKnow he ... he has higher standards than they do [noise] scary just made an\nImportant point before the break um you know a ... um to claiming the press I I'm criticizing the press today all almost all of them\nFor their arrogant denunciation of what Donald Trump is trying to do with birthright citizenship and they're oh so hardy and so certain views that it requires a constitutional amendment which it does not for anyone who knows the first thing about this debate\nAnd it's not hard to find and I was criticized a simple Google Search shows you everything you need to know about it [noise]\nUm but as Gary said you know he he's an expert on cars were all expert at something and he happens to be an expert on cars I'm an expert on what am I an expert on sasquatch I guess he knows he's an expert on cars and he noticed that you know the press when they write about\nAlso\nBack to their over thirty of two thousand and Eighteen this was how easy it would be for the press um\nThey have been all day starting with what I saw this morning on CBS uh the morning news show of guilt King I'm making fun of the president for not understanding the constitution for talking about ending birthright citizenship [noise] showing a picture of the fourteenth amendment and highlighting\nAlmost all of the first section but not the park but actually the president is relying upon\nA and knocked the part that is the subject of the debate [noise] um but I saw going through Fox and through every other Media Analysis today\nSmuggling saying the president doesn't nobody's talking about if he wants to end right birthright citizenship you can't do it through an executive order or even a simple act of Congress says Lindsey Graham is saying he has to do it through a constitutional amendment and that will not happen and they could not be more wrong\nThis is not hard folks there is been a lot of debate on this and we can walk through it again as I did in my early morning it earlier monologue last hour\nBut effectively you have to read the whole part of the first section of the fourteenth amendment it's not\nIt does not say all persons born or naturalized in the United states are citizens of the United states did says all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the United states and a lot of scholars now I'll walk starting with it or or some twenty five thirty years ago but a lot now having picked up on his work\nHave gone to the congressional record\nWhen they were debating the wording of the fourteenth amendment to realize that that language\nDid not mean to include illegal aliens heck it was inserted there to show that it didn't include Native Americans or what they called Indians who were clearly born here this is not the time to be um an idiot\nThis is a very serious issue many people in the conservative movement have been talking about this reform to the fourteenth amendment for a long long time and this smoke happy\nJoyful gotcha attitude of the press that the president is being done to her head or an idiot well they're the ones who are showing themselves to be done to our heads are idiots it's not hard to find indeed haven't spoken about the spoken about this for the past to our\nListeners Suzanne just emailed me how easy it is to get a copy of the congressional record\nTo see what people like Senator Howard and lemon Trumbull were saying about this phrase so when they highlight it and yellow and put it up on the screen look at what they leave out or if they highlight the whole thing and don't talk about the part\nSubject to the jurisdiction there of 'em know that they're pulling them all over your eyes or they're too dumb to take the well off their own which they might be which they may be but I'll tell you something you know if you're going to go out and attack someone politically\nOr legally or any other way do just a little homework and it doesn't take much\nAll you have to do is go to Google this is a well argued debate\nNow if you want to have a debate about whether the executive order process is the best way to change birthright citizenship rather than an act of Congress you will be on better ground I think that is a much more reasonable thing to debate I myself am of mixed mind over it\nI think it is for certain\nThat if Donald Trump or to do this by executive order you would find a court probably in the Ninth Circuit that would immediately um come to the less rescue on this that would immediately enjoying it and then litigated up to the Supreme Court but guess what folks the Supreme Court has actually never dealt with this issue\nNever dealt with this issue people will be quick to say no there's this Eighteen Ninety eight case no there isn't\nNo there isn't that had to do with a legal national [noise]\nThe child of it in a legal Nash excuse me the child of a legal national not the children of illegal nationals\nThere is no Supreme Court case on this issue is been a practice it is not constitutionally and I don't even think it's a statue of Charlie required\nThe statute on point is a mirror recitation of the fourteenth amendment it doesn't clarify the phrase subject to the jurisdiction there of\nBut the people who wrote the fourteenth amendment did they did clarify what that meant and they said very specifically what it applied to\nAnd what it didn't apply to and I won't bore you again with it you can get it yourself if you want or just Googling it but it meant not owning allegiance to anybody else and being subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United states\nI'm senator Howard who wrote the phrase senator from Michigan Michigan\nWrote that um the jurisdiction understood as allegiance understood it was to be understood as the legions and excludes not only Indians who are clearly born here\nAnd we're the children of you know children of children who were born here or persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers ministers so it's not simply mean subject to American laws or courts okay\nThis is not Donald Trump misreading the fourteenth amendment this is the journalist ... ... ... riding him core misreading the fourteenth amendment will\nTalk to Mark Krikorian at the bottom of the hour he's the executive director of the center for Immigration Studies and he'll give us a little bit more on that or you can go back to my monologue from the first hour\nPeople ask me can I get those monologues on line you bet nine sixty the patriots dot com way of everything on line [noise] except the music and the commercials and is there twenty four seven [noise] for you\nI write or email or I guess I'd like to follow up on it from Eileen talking about how um how depressing things are to her how um\nState of the media is just become so corrupt indeed has um but it's in some respects deliberate do we have the um the mash up still Anthony can we do that\nI listen to this this is this is interesting it's been flying around on Twitter the last day or so and I just had to play it for you this is a um a mash up of talking has\nPrimarily from MSNBC and CNN\nOver the last two years um and it's funny if you watch it on line you can see the month they're doing it but this is throughout mostly twenty Seventeen and then towards the end it gets into twenty Eighteen this is why the media is not to be believed listen\nHam radio news von ...\nSays this means to beginning of the president Donald Trump beginning of the under the Trump presidency was high from his rivers on\nPoint I usually just as important as a tipping can we get over it was the beginning in the ass reminds me a lot of a lab mix a\nLong list of the beginning of Seattle's forty seven eating you know the end of the walls closing [noise]\nOr you can show you around all day and I think like in the area have been going for\nAnything like this his presidency is critical\nOf feelings are funny Seventeen you can argue down that everything's changing again a bombshell the beginning of the end of the religion in the beginning of me and\nIf this were football games for the for the quarter may even be the beginning of the three begins with a bombshell though there are a lot of trouble in front of\nA president who resigned Michelle this is the point where [noise]\nI think the president will serve out his term resignation resignation I don't think this president is going to serve out his term Mr Trump will not serve out his um if you will not serve out his term no way no how absolutely fond so I think some of this\n[noise] [noise] over\nA wall climbing walls closing yeah this is going to be the Achilles' heel is tied to the cars this we will be the watershed we decided was terrified of lamb feels closer you know the walls\nAnd then get on their clothes and the other day changed everything gets more into the conversation on our storage radio bomb shows are and you know you get to that\nPoint I first of all I'm I'm not sure he's ever been more popular than right now after all those walls of closed in the tipping point has been passed and he would be resigning within moments and [noise] I ... is the beginning of the end [noise] have you seen the rallies um have you found a candidate that doesn't I mean you know\nThere was there was a quiet all the chatter raise\nThe question earlier in the year before campaign season began in earnest saying I Wonder if Republicans are going to want the president coming to campaign for them you see what the answer is the answer is hell yes I mean even in this very close race in Arizona between cinema and mix Sally she brought in Donald Trump\nIn a state you know he didn't win by that much [noise]\nThe walls are not closing the media is wrong again and again and again [noise]\nAnd the only thing I Want to say though I Know I'd be wrong because it's too much money and political radio all the the olive tree invested in it [noise] is that I think it's the beginning of the end for them [noise] it's probably not but I'll tell you something [noise]\nKnow so we're she has a lot of explaining to do you know um yeah I don't know if you are roughly how old are you how I don't know it doesn't matter you don't have to tell me but I remember him when he was part of the Gingrich revolution of Ninety four\nI remember being so impressed with him as a freshman congressman that I wrote to him wanting in law school to volunteer to work in his congressional uh office I was really impressed with that guy early on\nI'm smart he was um for quick on his feet he was tough I remember him shouting down a Democrat and wanted to reclaim his time on the floor of the house\nI just really liked him then you know fast forward all these years and he had his problems with the leadership I guess a lot of them did and that's fine but he stayed a pretty good Republican for a while\nAnd then he started giving Donald Trump a lot of good press and media and gosh knows what happened I mean he I I don't I don't know I mean I if I were if I were rude and crude I Would say it's better than sleeping on the couch\nYou know or maybe just got a little bit too much sun down there in Florida maybe but maybe you know I you know you know it's it's an odd thing to watch the to nothing to watch\nIt is usually people trying to obviously his wife or his fiance are as contract one of those two things maybe both\nProbably ... yeah it probably will you know this this lady who had it written you said she was depressed by what's on the news yeah ... ... ... my my thought on that is\nYou know you have a we have the wheat and the ... and the\nWheat is what's actually going to happen which is Donald Trump is going to buy like nobody's ever fought before for what he believes including whether or not we have this ridiculous birthright citizenship\nThat is the week the trap is what all these idiots most of whom are probably just didn't doctor needed they don't even understand what they don't understand anymore and uh you know I talked to a young person who had gone through journalism school is so incredibly biased\nUm and it's it's essentially it's left wing indoctrination of these people know not getting their blank slates\nAnd so they they'll call up a you know their source result they was a leftist course 'cause there are a professor\nAnd they will just tell them you know and so these people they know nothing they don't do their research or their staffs are all left wing you\nKnow and our our challenges I think is as people who are not Democrats is to get people to know this the way that we know that you know\nEverything that these people say is skewed\nYou have to know that it's not only skewed I think you'll agree with me that it's most likely at least fifty percent chance at least so\nRight to tell
