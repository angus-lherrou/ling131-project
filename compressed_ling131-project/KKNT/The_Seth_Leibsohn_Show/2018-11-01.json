I've learned a word a day I really have yesterday I learned a new word today I'm learning a new what good are conducting or\nGun decade Milo is so so that was four years ago or four and a half so and and that also falls not only on my opponent who was a mayor of Phoenix since two thousand eleven or twelve these are his constituents who says this is a major institution you know this district\nHas Arizona State university I ... when he was mayor of Phoenix okay that seemed to be but the Phoenix VA is one of the major major institutions in the city of Phoenix and it happens to be in CD\nNo I never did anything and here we are four and a half years later on the most recent scoring sadly the Phoenix VA still got one out of five stars under its own rating system so he'll still while so and again I'm not this is a cure some cinema who's held the seat I'm not saying that somebody else more\nThan ... percent of because it's true she ... her but I I worked there and she tells herself as a veteran's advocate and hasn't lifted a finger I've never seen never seen them never seen them and\nI've never seen great stand as mayor of Phoenix I started working there he he was mayor for two years that I worked\nThere did he ever come in go come see an old veteran did you ever say how can I help how can I use my bully pulpit how can I use my op ed pen that he has waded into\nAnother advantage and what's your reaction was you know he's not only two hours of it not to come to the ... only\n... but for the for the veterans hasn't done a thing and and he ... himself again as a veteran's advocate because it's politically expedient but again talk is cheap and when you look at the record the record speaks for itself and he hasn't done anything for veterans and and I expect that he won't I'm\nSteve when you when you look at the problems with the VA I Know it's something you want to tackle or friends of mine of talk to me about how important it is to have not only physicians but veterans in the house of representatives are not actually that many are though you would be one of what\nThey're one of ten physician right in the entire house in in the Congress we have Eighteen percent of Congress are veterans yeah and in the Nineteen seventies it was Seventy five percent right to quadruple because I'm back in the Senate eighty one percent\nSo I I I say all the time that I ... I ... and that's again that's a that's a holistic number that's not by party right\nAnd I think there are well intentioned people they're on both sides of the oil that they ... you know they appreciate veterans but they don't understand what they don't understand what the military what the active duty force is doing and they don't understand the challenges the veterans are having\nThe D. CVA which is as you know someone I knew better audio it's just a few miles you could you know just a few miles from the capital is one of the most\nUm blighted VA is in the country on the hospitals\nAnd all that it's a sham this and and it's interesting because I remember you know back when those scandals were breaking out when I was in DC I Would say you know these places should be a palace and I was corrected by a veteran when I went to go and they said we\nWe don't need it to the house we don't want to pass we just we just want what everyone else gifts and the promise as you said the promise that we were made to buy this government that's all we're asking for nothing special one\nOf the greatest things one of the greatest gifts and you could talk to I'm sure your dad trained at a VA almost everyone in America trained at a VA at some point in their career then one of the things that you will uniformly find and I'll say this and leave it to people to do their own survey\nThey you will find a healthcare professionally a physician say the veterans are amongst the the best patients will ever take care of in their entire you practice medicine fifty years and you will always have the greatest esteem and love for the veterans because they are just they're they're they're grateful to appreciate that they don't ask for\nSpecial treatment and they're they're just wonderful people to take care of their the the ... board the heavy lifting for the country and now all they want again no frills just the care they earned\nPromissory note cashed that's all right that's it that's right jak is in Phoenix Jack you're on the line with Dr for are\nThe good lord blessed thing on the air thank you very much\nMy experience with Iran\nI think the most ... on the world and I did or near the coast guard\nWould be like Arnold Palmer their own and we have a great honor and we were going that number back and\nForth\nTo are saying\nIt's it's a good call ... ... it's a good question because it is true Steve I'm some people do have an excellent job so that it may well I I remember whenever I've opened the phones on it I have gotten a tale of two cities\nSets right hold that thought for the last next segment of ethical absolutely we'll be right back on the other side of some concluding thoughts and not a bad place to some of the things [noise] serious to doctor for heart after his family which is his fellow veterans I'm stuck leaps and he's the for our don't go away we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn ... here with your culture an economy tip number four\n[noise]\nWhat do you Jimi Hendrix Picasso Howard Hughes and Abraham Lincoln all have in common [noise]\nThey all died without an escape plan a written a state in retirement plan can't promote confidence and a degree of control over the wealth you've worked hard to accumulate [noise]\nI've been assisting my clients reached the financial goals for over twenty five years you can help you as well call for eight or nine nine one ten fifty five to schedule a complementary financial consultation business at Grand canyon planning dot com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter again that number is four eight or nine nine one ten fifty five I'm John Donne Brodsky reminding you don't run out of money before you run out of time\n\nSecurity advisors Harris has offered to climb on security that must be a member of the NRA and to make an investment advisor Grand Canyon planning and claim when security they're not affiliated\nEvery twenty [noise] nothing kids who [noise]\nThree point five million kids won't receive a diploma over the next four years\nUnited Way knows that kids who have a caring adult in their life are more likely to major and the difference between the dropout and a graduating could be you take the lead to volunteer\nNow United way down or [noise]\nBrought to you by United Way and the ...\n[noise] I'll go\nBack to the eastern shore last segment share with a doctor Steve Ferrara\nOr not our last segment ever but our last segment day Steve I'm color was a bright before the break saying you know his experience with the Veterans Administration to be hospitals have been very good and that is true I have heard the tale of two cities some people have wonderful experiences how can we expand batter extrapolate the great\nTo the problem areas I've been working in education policy for years trying to figure that out for education\nHow do you do at the VA exactly\nWell and and I appreciate jak saying that because that is absolutely true and that's why I always support keeping the cars and and I keeping the VA and and I'm Glad he's had good care of their because I'm One of the provider so I ... I like to bake I provide good care and I know they do and it has some of the most dedicated people there are so\nSo again and he asked about the score and Justin and so again this is where again a government one size fits all top down now it's their own system\nSo you like to think that they designed it to be what it wants to what it can be and they get one out of five stars in it has a lot of limitations but the problem is the fact is the\nWelcome back Wednesday October thirty first two thousand and eight gene I Am so leaps\nAnd our phone number six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero\nI um I Hope I don't have to be a on this issue for much longer for two reasons one is I Hope it ends once the election and next week and the other is I Hope people can grow up generally I just hope that can grow up and be a little smarter\nA I Am talking about the hysterical\nAnd hypocritical and double standardized language that the left has gotten away with and the the mainstream media has gotten away with when it comes to rhetoric we have being lectured to buy them about the\nRhetoric of our president and the rhetoric of our party I don't think we have that much to apologize for or change compared\nTo what they put out and to what they view I really don't and I am not going to accept any kind of nexus any kind of connection between and the thing with\nThis president has said that\nCan be blamed for the violence we have seen whether they were mailed devices or whether it was what took place in Pittsburgh\nIt is you're responsible and it is politically obnoxious to blame standard political speech for the actions of the racists and insane\nWe don't do it when it's on their side they shouldn't do it when it's on ours and I am blown away as I said by the double standardized process Max Boot I've talked about\nTalking on Bill Maher show over the weekend speaking on Bill Maher show over the weekend about how we have to tone down the rhetoric and in the next sentences but you have to understand we have an arsonist in the White House\nNot only is arson or crime it's obviously a violent crime and it's simply not true don't tell me we have to tone down the rhetoric but you get called the president on arsonist then of course we see the spectacle that his daily now on CNN [noise] we have a journalist from GQ\nWho says on a show with Jake Tapper on the lead I think this president one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is about radicalization and he is radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did\nFactually false and politically and rhetorically obnoxious\nJake Tapper did not chime in Jake Tapper was moderating it he was asked to chime in by the loan conservative on that panel and Jake simply said OK you disagree with it it's not something to disagree with\nIts fake news it's fake information it's false ISIS has obviously killed tens and was responsible for even more than the tens of thousands of people that have killed\nDonald Trump's radicalized more people than ISIS then Don Lemon\nYesterday I've been loath to play it but people said you have to play it I've been loath to play it because I thought it had enough attention but I guess it's important to shine as much light on this as possible do you have done ... lemons audio from yesterday\nOne ethnicity but we we messages about this little with this weekend I keep trying to force people not to demonize any one group or any one less than a city\nBut we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist or something else some ... some people who are marching tours of order like feminine and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them ... do you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized ... up to the right\nThere you go and we have to offer demonizing but understand the problem in this country is white\nMen but stop demonizing but the but it's white men but stop demonizing [noise]\nAs far as I can tell\nAs far as I can tell Don woman is not an opinion hosts CNN is a news anchor at sea and and now there's this interesting thing going on where the people at CNN like to make fun of\nTheir competitors Fox or wiping the floor with them in ratings and liberals like to make fun of Fox for its hyper politicized a product\nThe truth is it is not hyper politicized it's hardly politicized at all until the evening throughout the day Fox News is basically a standard news channel if anything\nIf anything given Shepard Smith spot it tilts left during the day given his host\nAt night you bet you bet Sean Hannity or Ingram those shows are conservative shows and they tell you they are they make no bones about it\nBut they don't have news shows during the day that masquerade as opinion shows CNN does it all day and all night long one is telling the truth\nOne is not I'm hoping it in ... I'm hoping it ends after the election now we have calls yesterday asking\nWill it ever end will it ever and well the hysteria ever come to stop\nThe only thing I can say is\nWith decisive enough victories it might was decisive enough victories it might lead to some self reflection it might lead to some understanding of the distance\nBetween the professional commentary and journalistic class in the mainstream media\nThe rest of the country [noise] media journalism anchoring it's to inform but it's to be responsive it's to inform the public that you have to be responsive to when you are consistently wrong that's one thing\nBut when you are consistently out of step with your population with your audience that's another thing altogether\nAnd if we can show decisive enough wins on behalf of and on the side of common sense it might lead to some self reflection you know right after the election\n[noise] twenty sixteen the New York times put out an apology and it said we're going to do better\nWe're going to do better to not only have less\n... less anonymous sourcing we're going to do better to try and represent the audience that clearly has voted for\nDonald Trump at least they said they didn't do it but they did say it we need them to do it\nAnd the only way we can do it it's not by stopping are subscriptions it's not by not watching them that's not going to do it because these I think our last leaders for the corporations clearly CNN\nDoesn't care about the ratings but if they care about being consistently wrong\nConsistently wrong their egos that's what they care about I think that will matter [noise] parties do it all the time parties do this all the time when they consistently lose elections they\nHave these conventions and meetings and\nSummit's memos about policies they have to look at to relocate a language\nThey need to tinker with or change we need to forty ... that same kind of self reflection and contemplation on the mainstream media that's how it will and that's the only way I Know\nThat it will and that in addition to\nAll of us calling them out when they're wrong you have to call it out and that's why I was happy\nTo go against my initial reaction which was not to play the ... you know but I was happy to do and people started emailing saying you got to play it yeah you're right we do you have to call them out every term because I still maintain\nThough there are those of you that same CNN is irrelevant and it doesn't matter I just disagree I disagree\nTwo reasons one is there are a lot of people who get their information from there there are a lot of people who do and they're not even necessarily ideological they're just working off the fact that it has a brand name they know\nThat issue one issue\nToo and this is the real test [noise] just in the one [noise]\nWho had a message to get out were invited by CNN [noise] come on and give the message [noise] they'd say yes they'd say yes it matters that matters it's our job to make them matter\nI've seen you guys do it ... more than a couple of times I Would want a hundred percent agree you guys always when you do catch it it's an immediate oh my goodness\nYeah we're we're gonna get I mean you can actually get an air from time to time the question is well I mean\nYou know I think the biggest problems in the world that really cause all these problems one of them is is misunderstanding the fact that we're all imperfect and just wanting to think or picked and you're not sure\nAnd and come back that up the other the other factor that followed that up usually right sharply\nIs is\nAllowing a motion to control us before understanding\nYeah absolutely ah comprehension I'm a after compassion writer compassion coming easier than comprehension take the example I was working with yesterday though for a second I'm Shepard Smith opening his um opening his show yesterday\nA de riding and declining against Donald Trump or trying to get rid of birthright citizenship and saying this was an unconstitutional move you cannot do this because the fourteenth amendment is that error is that you're gonna rent or is that political um I I guess I'll never know the oddest\nPart and I said I think it's a combination\nI I think it's a combination I Do I I Do as well but that's the kind of thing you see all the time that I'm really talking about it's the kind of constant political\nDrumbeat where you can take something and make it deliberately um any a logical deliberately political deliberately antagonistic and not true and not true there is a very serious debate we tried to Aaron all yesterday a very serious debate going on\n... among experts or the constitution and the fourteenth amendment and immigration as to whether it's constitutional or not no we don't know exactly because the Supreme Court has actually never ruled on this\nAnd the Congress has actually never taken it up it has been a policy that a lot of scholars have said\nDonald Trump is very likely right on us so for Shepard Smith a news anchor to open up and saying Donald Trump is making an unconstitutional action that's that's just if it's ignorance it's weaponized ignorance is\nVery true I I think it I think it all falls into that Trump's arrangements syndrome though where people are so blinded by their hatred for Trump that it because I'm ... I'm I'm lacking the word of when you fly when you live out something so much to believe it\nYeah no it becomes normal and ... yeah it's it's pathological beyond pathological it's acceptable\nTo get up to ... within their circle it's accepted a hundred percent with yeah even easier to live under the watchful about it for more than ... loved accept us so it's All right\nWe're getting please six zero to five zero eight zero down six zero we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\n\n\nNine sixty no matter how real combat the Pentagon ...\nMore active duty troops to the U.S Mexican border five thousand troops there to be deployed my week than talking with reporters that the white\nHouse today President Trump said he may increase the number and repeated his vow that Central American caravans will not be allowed into the U.S meanwhile a group of Central American migrants facing deportation set fire to a Mexican immigration facility and an apparent attempt to escape\nRipe are reports of fire was reportedly started when a group of migrants how that a makeshift detention center set fire to their mattresses the Anthony contest Mexican authorities report it to use a firearm and Molotov cocktails by the migrants to Honduras men allegedly shot it costs guarding the migrant caravan\nAs they make their way through Mexico to the United states\nThe on [noise]\nNot ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court upholding the state's fetal homicide law this\nMonth may make its way up to the U.S Supreme Court to revisit the Nineteen Seventy three roe v Wade ruling the Washington Times reports the case in Alabama involved Jesse libel Philips who was convicted of killing his wife when she was eight weeks pregnant\nThe court sentenced him to death for the murder of quote two or more person he appealed arguing that an unborn child is not a person\nThe state Supreme Court upheld his death sentence fighting the interest in protecting the life of both the born an unborn one of the Alabama justice is that the case should go up to the high court because it is a quote logical fallacy for the government to consider a fetus a life in a murder conviction but not when it comes to a woman deciding to get an abortion\nTo be watching for the closure and he's found down laugh at thirty Fifth Avenue that do police activity in the area they need to avoid and trying to think northern or Peoria hands and we got\nAn accident clearing up over and Scott down north than on the little one of mine had Indian school around here John ... with your market rap right here by Grand Canyon planning\n[noise] John John brought you here for your daily stock market wrap up for us to buy Grand Canyon planning stocks opened higher on the last day of training for October following through on yesterday's games all the major indexes hire across all sectors of the market\nPrivate payrolls getting two hundred and twenty seven thousand jobs in October versus a hundred and eighty nine thousand estimate according to a D.

bet I'm just I wanted to comment really it's a kind of the\nThirty thousand view of CNN you know years ago and complex who was writing his novels when they were all fairly new here you would use CNN as a reference say people are watching it for information that you know culturally it used to be that you know there are culturally it's I'm not sure what it\nIs you know it's a great point I used to uh you know I used to do some um work with people there and um work there are a little bit myself a long time ago and that's what they prided themselves on how they said well when there's a major event in the world around the country people tuned to CNN\nThat's right that's what they prided themselves on\nYou know you have Don woman who I I I'm not sure if he understands what state are you know or it's just it's so ingrained you can say things like there's about certain categories of people are which is probably what it\nIs I think it is that it's that little bridge you just made it how I don't know if they understand what they're saying at the same time because it's become acceptable to say certain things about certain people it's acceptable to start off in news casts\nUm blaming Donald Trump because it's a acceptable and it's you don't understand that that's not appropriate you know if you're there ... there are literally works when I talk about the double standards\nI'm I'm I mean it truly literally people don't see a problem as I don't think Don Lemon sees a problem with what he said it's acceptable to blame\nA certain race in a certain gender as long as it's that certain race in that certain ... it's acceptable it's fine whereas we take an absolute standard and say white black purple you name it it's wrong\nMale female or one of the other fifty six categories Facebook identifies with Jim it's wrong I ... and ... but but there is a sector in this country an idiot logical sector in this country that thinks not only is it not wrong they think it's right they almost they almost think it's a duty\nActually all that stuff that's real real issue to talk about delivering good [noise]\nI think you've um I I did your your your first point is the one that intrigues me the most a lot of the others are are great um either but I wrote them down as you were speaking [noise]\nUm the hiring too young that that is a huge problem I agree with you or if they are hiring young people um that that that is absolutely right because a lack of life experience be\nYou know it it does matter I mean we have been talking for years about the decline in education while those chickens are going to come home to roost and they have\n... and then you add on top of that by um the hyper uh the hyper a partisan or any allied ... ... it's\nA schooling that these people these young people have received [noise]\nAnd that certainly in the mix now not all of them most of them don't get to get their own TV shows or their own radio shows a lot of them start off his reporters are beat reporters for newspapers or\nMagazines or researchers and a sister producers for the anchor strike um the ... or ... assistance the people who do the hard copy exactly they're still however\nIs a responsibility by\nThe increasing the editors who are a little bit older and a little bored experience they should know and what they receive from their research assistants or what they want to say on TV is rot is wrong or right or wrong\nOr they they should be able to know that you know one of the things we've been I I don't know if you consider radio alternative media or not but [noise]\nUh clearly the blogosphere has been considered alternative media by the mainstream media you know uh when the Drudge Report is I'm a unveiled itself in the late nineties and then [noise] we\nHad all these debates and the two thousands about you know what constitutes media and press for the purposes of protection against you know prosecution or First Amendment defense is you know the mainstream\nMedia uh would often um say that you know the blogosphere places like power line they would include um any number of\nWeb sites or that that they weren't the same thing they weren't entitled to the same protections\nAs the mainstream media um and they weren't entitled to the same respect their credibility because they didn't have the editors they didn't have a system you go through if you will arrest so Pfeifer procedure you go through to check facts and\nYou know have have have adults in the room so to speak\n[noise] um this this is what we have been told for years and years and years um that you know anyone with a wire\nAnd I'm In those days modem anyone today with a you know and I asked the on line or or a wife I system can put out whatever they want and you know there's no fat checking to it will it turns out it doesn't it\nThat all these layers and do types of editing and professionalism that places like CNN or for that matter the Arizona Republic amount to very little\nAmount of little I mean they're broadcasting error after air after air never mind the ideology just as to what you said which I Am fascinated by\nThat journalism is about facts not necessarily the truth I'm an ... and you're right about that but they get the facts wrong so often but never never mind the truth I I understand that distinction it's delicate but I get it and you're right to pointed out to get the facts wrong all the time\nSo that [noise] the news stations where I worked um [noise] a regular basis Ruth side because although these effects of this is the state the facts\nWe don't have time and that's the other issue here [noise] everything's on a deadline\nUm I mean when I when I worked in when I worked in the news that deadline was right now mhm of course it was it was on a lot of even the fact checking out look good if it's six were good then it went on the air\nRight about that that's a fair point but the problem here and I I I still agree with you that that that I think it should be about news about packs but the problem here this is the thing Prager races all the time with bias\nIs most of the by ... comes from what's not written rather than what is slowly right and so it so just having the fax\nIt may not be enough because you can't put out a newspaper let's say you're a television show with all the facts on a story it's the selection of which facts you decide to put in right so you you would get this example and I and I'm saying for the rest of the audience as one\nUh one almost one ... there is we could pick any number of things is is on the top of my mind for another reason\nFor almost ... almost every time there is a a terrorism ups or ... or or an insurgency ... or has the law or Hamas uh inspired series of rocket attacks or intifada aimed at Israel\nOr it is classic illustration that when Israel will respond it will you know be told that I'm a hospital has been stricken\nFor example or a school has been stricken by Israel\nAnd put it in the story and that you have to go to ancillary media or\nI'm a a double August\nIs that the terrorists were using that as a shield or hiding out there or keeping it as a weapons depot\nWill that just changes the story altogether then doesn't it right so it's it's not just that\nYou can get away with some of the facts if you're going to weaponize the story for a political purpose you're gotta put in all the facts relevant to that story [noise] otherwise you're nothing more than just a piece of bias I'm just a piece of\nThat's it right Russ what a great call to be right
