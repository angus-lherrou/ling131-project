a\nQuestion from Jordan up in Phoenix or Tempe er which is part of CD nine uh how you would compare and contrast or what you experienced in Canada here and fixing the system and those directions I wanted to give you a better opportunity 'cause we're up against the clock and all\nGetting it going my name's\nBecky ha\n[noise]\nFrom policy to culture principles to politics [noise] this is the leaves and show [noise]\nHere's the\nLeaves and show and I am Seth leaves and Wednesday October two thousand and Eighteen delighted to have in Studio\nHe agreed to stay with us a little bit longer Dr Steve Ferrara he as a candidate for Congress running right here in congressional district nine from once we broadcast\nIf you have a question for Steve his phone number is six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero an expert on so many issues not because\nHe just studied them which he did but because he also lives them and that runs the gamut\nFrom national security to domestic policy particularly in health care Steve I Want to get into some of it some of your other issues but we did have a caller Danny who I think wanted to follow up on something with regard I think to the Veterans Administration uh Danny euro on with Dr for our\nAir\nVery well thank you I Want it to a ... you're on a the idea of having a bill drafted that were to require federal employee senators are representative and\nA half to require your hospitals but our health care of me I understand that this was a\nBit of a down in the hour every right to sure that they would ... them in order to improve conditions for the\nCongressmen senators abiding by the laws they pass for others having to live with the strictures they put in place for others but the VA ... in this case Steve I Know has its own concerns as a closed system but go ahead and address it generally if you'd like\nYeah you know I think it's a a it's a it's a bold I like it because I'm always one that says don't ask anyone else to do something you're not willing to do yourself and I think if you live by that\nNATO then not only you know can you sleep well at night but you know people will trust you and it builds those relationships so you know and I appreciate you being sensitive to the burden but you know frankly especially if you're talking about Congress and the Senate by a hundred and five all they can also drop in the bucket they have\nAlmost ten million enrollees so they could certainly absorb it um and I think you're 'cause I think you're right I mean\nIf if you had to if they had to do it then they would be they be stakeholders one of the things I think is a fundamental problem and I say this about so many things that and again I say it about\nThe military and even you know are overseas contingency operations\nI'm there aren't enough people that are stakeholders\nAnd I think that leads to sack was policies because if you don't have any skin in the game and you know there are no perceived to have any skin in the game\nIt it has an effect on the decisions you make in a in ... as soon as you get somebody engaged I tell you what they you know they look at the shoe more carefully they see it through a different lens and I think that's a really I\nI Would be happy to uh I don't think it would pass I have to say but I think it would be a great gauntlet to throw down it'd be a great line in the Santa drawing I'd be happy to do it because I go there\n[laughter] good enough for you or six zero to five zero eight zero nine six zero if you have a question for Dr Steve Ferrara candidate for Congress here in Studio ... I'm going to circle back to something\nYou were saying there Steve and you and I have never talked about this but you're such a mind to live uh I'm happy to throw you the question [noise]\nUm we're at a point in our country where fewer and fewer people probably at any time in our history probably fewer than anytime in our history know someone who has worn the uniform of the United states that's kind of issue one addressing a little bit about what you were talking about\nIssues too I'm sure you've seen the studies if not I'm sure you're aware of the ongoing recruitment problem from the bottom up their ongoing serious problems in recruitment not\nNecessarily even those that don't want to get involved but aren't eligible to be involved based on all kinds of health problems\nEven substance abuse issues this is this is to me a growing bomb a ticking time bomb\n... and you nailed it you you know right on that's not surprising like you do so very insightful this was something we grappled with a lot before I left my job at headquarters\nWe talked about the army had commissioned a large study that found in my numbers may be a little off but they're not much out there within a couple of percent that something like only twenty four percent of you know the recruitment age Americans were even eligible\nThat's the number I saw I saw some things around Seventy on the other and it\nIs a it's astonishing right then it's because of things like um like obesity city um it seems like criminal record substance abuse and gang tattoos all as one of the other things too and I'm In so that is a national security risk when right off the bat you take a you know\nVital country like ours and you lose Seventy or Seventy five percent of our potential talent\nThat can't serve their country one and if they wanted to even if they want us to the military doesn't benefit from that and then also they don't get the opportunity so so in that but that's something that has to start so early because when you're talking about a few of those things\nYou know these are habits that are like start very early on in life and so that is again it's a cultural shift that has to occur and that is those are things that have to have to happen at the community level at the at the church or the faith base level and whatnot and and even this the notion of\nAnd clearly you know I'm very proud ... proudest job I ever had ever have served in the military um and I know that there is a great deal of goodwill in the country about those who serve\nBut it's making it ... the appealing profession\nThat that it used to be you know the the term brain drain I'm sure as you know says comes from in World War one every body and the ivy league left to sign up for the military and they actually the government had almost pushed back in ... the that's where that came from the brain drain was everyone\nLead and it was an impetus for the GI Bill after the second World War quite frankly is right I could affordable to put these people back in school\nSo so these are the kinds of things we want to make it a you know a career path that is appealing to folks so that when you know young people you know they start with whether it's physical fitness whether it's other things so that they say hey I don't want to blow my shot at being able to\nServe in the military that's a great thing um and so so I Hope we can get to that point\nUm because then again the more people we have that are stakeholders also it makes our foreign policy better um you know I just tweeted out a a a graphic that that came out it was out of Brookings but then a a group that I'm very proud to have the endorsement of with honor which supports veterans running for Congress\nAnd they showed a scatter plot of the bipartisanship in Congress\nAs a function of ... percent were veterans of how interest in it is it's we're on a downhill slide in the Nineteen seventies when we had Seventy five or ... percent\nIt it almost as a purple blah I mean the the bipartisanship is tremendous\nAnd now it's dropped and now the the the plot the scatter plus don't even touch the red and the blue barely even have their their sentiment is a part of the graphic so you know ... ... veterans are people that were you know they get things done back to the earlier statement there's no partisans in a foxhole and\nYou know you sit there and go well you're a Republican I'm a Democrat or vice versa\nLet's just solve this problem\nYou're a real doctor an MD not a doctor philosophy but I Want to ask you a philosophical question and you're not a psychiatrist but you've done a psychiatry rotation I'm ... or or to or several you've also raise kids and saved a lot of children here and abroad\nThere is a bit of a crisis with boys and\nMaking men in our society and I wondered if you just might say a word about what you've seen whether it's around the world whether it's in your own house how do we fix that problem of finding children boys young men willing to serve young women willing to serve and our military that want to so that we can get\nNot Seventy percent ineligible but twenty percent ineligible\nWell I mean again a lot of it goes back to role modeling and how folks who we choose to make our role models in society um and I think\nWe've seen a shift where or cultural role models tend to less be people that are in public service or the military and more into people that are in entertainment or reality television or you know there's a lot of\nPursuit of things that are more ... of things I might pay more have more famer and and I think that is something that\nAn immediate by the way and immediate there's that there's this one is for the immediate payoff isn't there this is what I've seen a in the work I've done over the years but mostly in DC some\nHere in the inner cities who the young kids that Meyer or not the kinds of people you want your kids to be quite frankly you know what I'm Talking\n... you know someone was asking me today\nUm they said you know what do I think about being a candidate is fun and so forth and I you know I said there are certainly many son aspects about it most of all you know getting to meet people like stuff and\nAnd just the the community you know those things are great but a lot of it is to be Frank is is kind of a grind gets a lot of work and you know in what you really want you want to be able to get back to where you can\nEffect change so it's it's a process but I say I go well but it's no different to me than going through\nUh the only two classes of people though who are critical\nOf the tax cuts that I Know of are the Democrats for political purposes and those who don't think they went far enough that I have yet to find someone who does not appreciate the tax cuts that have come um that have come to place since ... since the Trump or since the Trump Administration has deployed them\nAnd it's a very it's it's it's a very important thing for people to remember that if you put the other party in power everyone's taxes are going to go up\nEvery once taxes are going to go up and that's\nSomething that even we in Arizona I Know what that means we have seen the difference between businesses particularly small businesses not just closing which is the extreme\nBut limiting a growth living expansion looting hiring under the previous administration versus what they are doing now which is not being able to even find workers because they want to hire more\nThat's right and not only are the taxes you know people are going to be getting hit from you know both sides because they're gonna they're gonna peel back the tax cuts are going to restore higher tax rates to people and then they're going to put more government in your health care and then this is you know again this is well\nDocumented that government run health care\nOr Medicare for all or whatever they're calling it these days brand another bumper sticker will double your taxes\nThis is a great campaign thing for all Republicans are you happy the IRS is out of your health care or not do you want the IRS back into your healthcare decisions or not we should just throw it on that point alone that alone should carry the day [laughter]\nIt again a man Lois Lerner you\nKnow we saw what she did\nI Want to um I Want to give out your website Ferraro for Congress F.

E. R. R. A. R. K. yeah\nEven if you like that I don't care for that guy I talked about the voice of reason and and I think the real story\nIs what's going on with our economy and its growth rate you know\nOur previous bread and said that we would never be groceries like again and yet here we are\nNo kidding right who thought four percent you know um we were coming to a once Trump ... but first year of the Trump Administration were starting to see three percent and\nA lot of people were jumping for joy over that and I kept saying you know three percent is great\nBut I Want four percent to be the new normal people said oh we'll never hit four percent were about to hit four percent and Steve is absolutely right Dr ... absolutely right this is this is not a debt we've built up that we're going to be able to tax our way out of\nThere is not a tax rate you could impose that will get rid of the national debt or the deficit with the obligations that we have the only way to do it is to expand employment expand\nInvestment and expand the economy or that's the only way you're going to do this and it's a it's a people centered it's a it's a growth centered it's an optimistic centered\nA philosophy that has worked before it can work again we\nDon't need to make life harder on Americans to solve the problems of America we really don't let's just get out of the way and let us do what we do best\nWomen you know um by you know criticizing them or by questioning their credibility in cases\nUh specifically a of sexual abuse\nAnd Lindsay said something that you know stunned Jeffrey Goldberg said he didn't know what he was talking about I don't know that the audience did either\nAnd he's been made fun of for it\nBut he knew exactly who was talking about and the fact that Jeffrey Goldberg didn't tell us the whole tale\nLindsey Graham said there's a lot of ways to silence women that we don't like and that can also include um slashing car tires and killing cats and Jeffrey Goldberg didn't nobody was talk what Lindsey Graham mountain Lindsey Graham had to explain it to them I have pulled up\nA Nineteen I knew what he was talking about because I was there at the time\nBut I have pulled up a Nineteen Ninety eight Washington Post story named Kathleen Willie mean anything she's a democratic a funder fundraiser bundler who at one point I was in um what you might call a fairly wealthy environment or her hosts\nAnd I so recall the story died as I recall the money was tight she went to her old pal Bill Clinton for help and Bill Clinton assaulted her\nHere's what the Washington Post wrote Wiley has said that she came under pressure to change her story before she testified against Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit\nShe told authorities that need some land oh Marilyn developer and prominent democratic fundraiser talked with her about her testimony\nShe also complained that shortly before her deposition and the Jones case her car tires were punctured her cat was killed an unknown man approached her and made menacing statements okay this is how you can silence women to thank gosh thank goodness Kathleen Kathleen Willie\nWould not be silenced and we can see the gross hypocrisy not only of the Democratic party but really the media for not even knowing these stories anymore not even knowing about these stories anymore and thinking the world's started in history started\nOh somewhere around July nine of two thousand and Eighteen\nOkay I'm One of the things we've also talked about here that I wanted to get to was and this is a call back from yesterday as well was if we're getting a if we're going to win this thing and this by this thing I mean the whole ... if we're going to reclaim our culture and our politics\nUm it's wonderful obviously that we have certain um institutions not many but certain institutions of higher education like Hillsdale huge help huge contributor to our culture and our politics obviously wonderful that we have this platform on TALK radio\nBut if we want to do it wholesale and if we want to do it from the beginning we still have to remember\nA what Tom\nPlato said or the two most important questions any society asks itself\nWho is teaching the children and what will they be taught\nIt's the education system ensure its colleges ensure its universities and conservatives love to work on college and university programs to instill\nVouch safe try and secure conservative message and gosh it's great that they do I'm all for it I've helped some of that but it's the elementary and secondary systems where it has to start or do you know how bad things are\nAnd if you want to know why we have the kind of young leaders we have who believe in censorship who don't believe in a religious freedom who does don't understand or the first through ten amendments who don't understand the rule of the republic\nA or a Republican form of government who don't understand why there's an electoral college who don't understand the basic concepts of our policy here's why are the investors business day we had a great editorial on a new survey ... survey finds that only one third of Americans\nOf adults only thirty three percent of American adults can pass the U.S citizenship test\nThe survey conducted by uh the Woodrow Wilson national ... ... police on Wednesday today\nFound that only thirty three percent of Americans would pass the citizenship test that's given to immigrants and this is on a test that only requires applicants to get sixty percent of the questions right\nYou've got a two thirds of adult Americans\nCouldn't get sixty percent of the questions right\nOn what is known as the U.S citizen ship\nTest fewer than one quarter for example she were than twenty five percent for example new why the columnist fought the British more than half fifty percent didn't know how many justices serve on the Supreme Court fully sixty percent didn't know which countries the U.S fought in World War two\nPicks up middle one for a moment we're having this huge debate about the Supreme Court and sell as real as qualified with judicial temperament is what the role of string court is half of adult Americans don't even know what the Supreme Court is\nMore troubling the survey found that younger people are far more ignorant about the most basic facts of us history and civics not surprising that but to get this uh pathetically low Nineteen percent of those under age forty five pass the test\nThank gosh for people over the age of forty five right remember the old dogma don't trust or listen to anyone over thirty you bet you better start listening to people over thirty it's the ones under I'm beginning to trust a little less and less these days especially as they work their censorship tools on our social media platforms\nI'm this is the problem and this is where we obviously need to start focusing a lot of our attention Joe is in Phoenix welcome to the show Joe\nChefs Hi

I\nThink that our culture as it digress as I Know that's where I work but I didn't just slowly gets worse and worse um I think that there will be those who are true believers who are dead heat however I think the vast majority I think it is\nCut down the middle and like I said I'm a black and white thinker so you know\nI Know [laughter] I I'm a night and I appreciate that Anita thank you thank you

what are my shoes and and maybe a lot of people that issue is the whole timeline of all of the [laughter]\nGo back and look at who I was in high school\n[laughter] I'm thinking about my high school years while I'm chuckling that's that's why I'm chocolate go ahead\nDo you know but I raised two daughter Warren graduate and it was a teacher now wanted to getting her law degree so me raising them at my life since high school is that all the race if someone looks at my wife in high school\nRight this is the moral bank account the dentist Prager has written about I Will tell you I'm I've gotten in trouble with fellow conservatives in fellow Republicans over the years I'm particularly when\nDuring the Obama presidency particularly even during the two thousand eight election when a lot of them wanted to talk about you know his\nCollege influence ers his college transcripts\nOr people he hung out with before college\nAnd I I made the argument then and I by and large stick to it now which is ... it's it's really a relevant to me I I Would not want to be judged by by things I did when I was Eighteen I Am not that person today and in fact in many respects I'm exactly the opposite person um\nYou know when I was\nMichael let me give you an example I'll give you a I'll give you one of many examples I cook [noise] but when I was sixteen I was protesting with the young socialist of America how different to him I mean what what would it what what would you know about me or my last Thirty years if that's what you know about me is zero you actually\nExactly and who is the same person they were in high school I feel sorry for that\nPer yeah right [laughter] right I Do we do have a few cases but it's but it's not the usual I'll get it right you know the exactly\nAnd how many how many on the Democratic side of the aisle how many of them would like to have their high school ... and early college Dave scrutinize\nYeah yeah no I mean it it it it totally true that having been said\nI still have to tell you I haven't heard anything um that substantiate the allegations that he has been charged with\nFrom when he was Fifteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen I mean even even even agreeing as you and I do that it would be you know ... you know ... irrelevant to his character today if the worst\nNot the worst part of of a lot of what has been set of them has been true we have we have no evidence that it is we haven't none well I\nI think the only thing that came out that he's a drink or was a drinker\nIt didn't come out he set a good deal [laughter] it was ... years now to drag it out of him and he put it in the same and put it in the record themselves that was the only\nThing that's been substantiated as he'd like to drink beer yeah yeah and and he substantiated and\nSaid Oh yes yes so\n[noise] so now he should be disqualified for living an exemplary life\nThere's only one that was only ... here's the irony of that Michael there's only one person I can think of at the top echelons of our government who has never had a drink in his life you know who that is president it's our president and see if the legwork\nWhat [laughter] okay All right [laughter] for

why it's even order I don't know sue if you looked at the research and statistics on south false allegations of rape [noise] um it's an interesting thing because for a while here we were told the

hover around five percent of the allegations a little over five percent\nThat several times larger than almost any other crime is false allegations so it's a ... it's it's unique in so many ways it's
