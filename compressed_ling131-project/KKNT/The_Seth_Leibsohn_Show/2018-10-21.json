All right well uh vitamin C is is not really new though\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell\nAnd unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends in the bottom line is with out enough vitamin C. and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies\nDiabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be shortened by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contains about sixty five milligrams of vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three or four thousand yeah and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice\nSo because of lack of vitamin C. or getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well\nThe number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just on the energy I don't feel like myself\nI'm hurting yeah and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we got to do this task send you through the scanner and the problem is is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd it was interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. alright other ones there aren't any pigs primates and the fruit bat\nWhen you look at the rest of the animals out there\nYou don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure you don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nYeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy but first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it\nRight but you know I think most people would be a myself included sinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is that you know what it is\nThe common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my supersede twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down to have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of\nVitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... your body needs different forms of it and I put it all into one vitamin formula\nNow and you said there was how much vitamin C. and your super see twenty to forty years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what water some of the the things that you'll experience\nWell the first thing you're going to experiences energy vitamin C. produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain cardiovascular issues allergies unexplained weight gain diabetics\nNeed vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is okay if I read an email to sure sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped it he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days\nYou know another thing that happened is I became more alert\nAnd I now have a clear head off and vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good settlement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy ... six years wow that's really amazing\nI Want to let your listeners know that if you want to get a free book about vitamin C. N. try Dr ... supersede twenty two formula absolutely risk free there's a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I didn't go to the supermarket before\nI got here [laughter] okay and I brought some vitamin C. and I went and bought these and I'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in it so\nIt right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well it's just one type of score but gas it\nRight it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... now cellulose has grown up newspaper\nOr the next one is uh vegetables Derrick\nI said now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form of\nA and the next one is a silica silica sand sand like the beach\nSorry so here's another one try this one here okay\nSo this is a national brand here right right so this was five hundred milligrams okay this is a jewel yes All right so take a look at the ingredients okay I'm\nPersonally ... sucrose sugar okay ... sure sodium a score right\nThat's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt\nSo now you're getting sodium fried vegetables ... said that that lubricant again and empty and see yellow number six there you go number six so now that's artificially collared vitamin C. now what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different\nFrom these that we are talking about well what's different about as I used twenty two different forms of vitamin C. and it's all naturally flavored\nNatural colors there's nothing artificial in it Chris so it's good for you and it's the only one that has this unique delivery method of being able to drink it down as water soluble goes right to work in your body and it has\nThe proper amount of vitamin C. per survey there's Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving ... there's nothing else on the market like it I've done tons of research vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies and it's really survive the test of time and\nOne of these studies suggest what are they saying well I'll give you I'll give you a couple of headlines this study was conducted at the University of California and it found that people who took vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease were reduced over forty percent that study reported in the international journal vitamin the nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes out ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C in their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Mila leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system our energy\nJust from vitamin C. wow now earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work well this is the kind of groundbreaking research on\nVitamin C. and weight loss but what happens is vitamin C is a natural appetite suppressant and it also increases your metabolism and your energy when your energy goes up yeah you start feeling better you can go out and take a walk let's bring some of it off\nSo you've created this supersede twenty to formulate its a powder right you mix it into a great tasting beverage invokes you love the taste of this now when you take your super see twenty two formulas is it something you can feel\nWorking I mean what ... what kind of do\nWell the first sign of health is more energy mhm

these scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best aggravates genes that control our weight or energy healthy aging you needed longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was spiritual yes rosy rich all the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nYesterday says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Allen freshman let me introduce brewer Twenty years Dr precedent as an institution in New York radio host these own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that your freshman welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to ya\nWell it's great to have you with us you know let's tension has roots mirrors also nominate those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was Mira ... why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a weekend every one of them seem to have an article about resveratrol basically ... recall a poly feeding all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries a deeper bound and peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd scientists really first became interested and resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when raspberry ... first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish\nWell anything that extends the life of anything is going to the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well by two thousand six fatty and scientists discovered that resonates ritual extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and it even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex and\nHere's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair reporter that red beret trial counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and my wife thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and even seem to protect the intestines in McAllen definitely supported normal and cinematic activity in the body it improved indoor and\nIt was even a great study I think it's that sort of genetics and cell biology in France that show that it dramatically improved indoor and storing aerobic activity\nAnd it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading about an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reserve mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent well whenever our health is threatened any perceived threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened switches on what they call the longevity Eugene and your body it switches on a sort of a protective mechanism that against on a secular level but capitalism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape\nAccording to the work done by David St Clair harbor notice as important\nThe most potent activate or oh the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking Roseburg ... pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just sit back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. formulas but now they feature co enzyme Q. ten would you say is just as important as his merits role especially for your heart health and your says in some ways that it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten ... what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak of water co enzyme is\nOur co enzyme is any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place like um vitamin in many respects well co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain\nYour heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat\nInto energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxygen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago\nWhile I was teaching for the first time and physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially use any traditional compound like raspberry retro fussing collectively target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement in our house in our aging and our longevity\nWell ... that's the person you say that you can hold in the lead status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented and so well researched and they didn't give us a brief overview of the research and explain why cook you ten researchers so widely respected\nWell let's go back to Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin the Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nUniversity of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana University of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti often cause major studies major universities right here in the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies\nAverage addicts mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have an energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow that you present purity products occasionally does these free bottled uber was this was something really special wasted is so important\nWell I mean you really get an opportunity you get a chance to see for yourself what I'm Talking about\nI mean you hear me say some pretty amazing things\nAnd you say well that's pretty interesting but until you know until you try this for yourself by taking too soft shelves a day of this co Q. super boost formula you're not going to really appreciate what I'm Talking about and the best way to do that is to call the number you gave out get your free supplied try it for yourself and you'll see the difference\nMore with our guest Dr Allen precedent in the middle but right now already products recognize leader in the field of evidence base nutritional solutions has an incredible free model offered today for the first thousand color so don't miss this chance the phone call now operators are sending by the cause free\nOne eight hundred Seventy one three six three three three one eight

products you just have in the shipping limited one per household the toll free number again one eight hundred\nSeven three six three three three one eight hundred seven three six three three three\nNow that the person we talked about the co Q. ten we talking about his merits role but you've added vitamin D to this and you've added vitamin B. twelve yeah now many people go through life not knowing when they've got a co Q. ten division with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine wow I mean that's a lot of people now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin date of bone and bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and a great in this study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and colon health\nI mean who thinks that those things right\nYeah that's amazing\nSo I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formula co Q. super boosts formula in addition to that I said the channel look we should put some B. twelve and here as well they're called ... and I say that because the twelve converse the carbohydrates and proteins and fats that you're eating convert them right into energy\nAnd this is all about energy and wellbeing\nNow let's see until you try this unique combination of the one hundred milligrams of co Q. ten the advanced research all the way you find them into these huge super boost formula that you know what you're missing but it's what you mean by that\nWell I Want you to experience it I mean I Know you've heard about how co Q. ten and resveratrol and B. twelve and vitamin D and by the way
