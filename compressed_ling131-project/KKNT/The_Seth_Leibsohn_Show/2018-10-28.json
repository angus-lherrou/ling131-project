S. A. P. S. owes them and this is you know we've been talking about this pretty much for since may now when I come out to see my family's in my household my my whole goal is\nI'm there to do my best work for my family is I Am not a solar company I Am I'm there to do my best work for you I've become an energy expert some people call me an energy I'm advocate a consumer advocate\nUm I'm actually friday a meeting with one of the board of directors of one of the big electric companies because I get some pretty I'm pretty important information that it's not privy to the public\nWill um [noise] a PS just had a rate increase so guess who was getting ready to have a a another rate increase um let's see other electric company so I go out and I find out accurate information and for for my homeowners my family's because my goal is to put\nMore of my family's hurt her money back into their pocket not the electric company a PS make four hundred and eighty eight million dollars last year in profits [laughter]\nWhat do you think their profits did this year when they rolled up these new re plans and we haven't even seen the end of this year yet it's it's just it's astronomically ridiculous and you know we worked so hard to to own our own homes\nUm and we come home at the end of the day\nAnd we want to live comfortably\nBut we need to live affordably in in our own home now\nThe power company has to get gas for you to tell us that the hottest time of day between three and eight PM so whether you are retired and your home in the daytime or you're working and you're coming home at five thirty six o'clock [laughter] they're getting you they they know you're going to be using electricity and that's the most expensive power but they're charging us for\nI Want to help as many families as I can understand this because this has never been about just slapping solar panels on your roof [noise]\nUm it was my daughter almost ended up being a bachelor story and I was watching out for her and if I hadn't of had the ability to create this formula and like kill all worksheet you're going to tell people how to go so that I Know my ...\nMy daughter would have ended up being a bad filler story um there's lots of them out there there's lots of people calling me stay in Sandy I went with this company in that company can you please help me I don't want to see families I'm going down a road that that that they're not going to have the maximum benefits and savings [laughter]\n... you know if you're working with a company and you want a second opinion you get a second opinion when you're having a surgery or medical opinion that this is just as important this is your family's home this is your power source [laughter] if you're on the right track I'm gonna say great you're on the right track there's enough business out there for everybody\nBut if you're not going to explain why you're not and what my recommendation is to you so please [laughter] this is not something that you do lightly and you don't do without thorough\nResearch and sitting down with [noise]\nUm yeah I Am I have become an energy expert in this particular field because it all started with my daughter my daughter's home we were my grandchildren lived I needed to make sure that it was gonna work because\nThat was my daughter's common where my grandchildren left and the other reason was I couldn't afford to help her pay her power bill if it didn't work so I take the same formula that I utilized for my daughter's home\nAnd that's the formula that I use for every one of my family's homes that work with me\nAnd that's why I'm so proud to be able to show people\nThe evidence of my work and with these new rate plans and everything the bills are starting to come in I'm asking my family to send them they're going to be up on my website we're putting them up there Tom but please go fill out your kill worksheet it only takes a minute Jeremy is going to tell you in a minute how to go to my Web site\nAnd if you have questions I I really really like when people ask me a lot of questions I Want you to understand that I Want you to understand\nHow your bill works now I Want you to understand how you be saving money when you are no longer renting essentially renting power from the the power companies and producing your own power on your roof and paying less for it and so I go to my Web sites within Germany can tell you how to do that\nYou you got it it asked solar Sandy dot com that ask solar Sandy dot com and make sure you're going to the right one no one postures make sure it ask solar Sandy dot com\nFor again if you're like me you just want to give them a call do six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine that six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine and yeah the website you go you see right up there that kilowatt worksheet you click on it and you're starting right there that is the best way to start\nAnd get it going because again you want\nTo be saving money we're going through all these built the payment made zero point zero zero they're not paying their savings so much money but like you said it's one thing at three o'clock where you want to come home you want to get the AC on you want to start the laundry you want to get the dishes and you want to tell you how to cook your dinner you want to cook dinner I can watch TV\nYou what you want to be able to live comfortably in your own home Jeremy [noise] you know savings are there I I I really can support the savings but again it's about living comfortably in your own home and you know we we had one ... one of the most significant rate increases this year actually there was a two part increased\nFirst part was rolled out last year and the second part they snuck it in may first calling new Reid plans a PS kind of does things like that\nAnd then they give us an accurate information when we call and they make recommendations oh that plan is very similar to your other plan now they're nowhere similar they're nowhere close [laughter] they're selling us to stay in power only they're selling it differently more extensively to us and if we think this is the last increase or the last\nUm [noise] the thing that's going to impact our cost of our power here in Arizona we are sorely sorely mistaken\nLet's talk about um I Am doing a town hall one out of things one of the things that is going to impact our power costs dramatically is everybody's been hearing about prop one twenty seven so yes I don't know\nThe and the signs all over the oh my gosh and then you\nSee the ads one says yes one says no\nAnd okay I'm not going to get into it on the air and that's why I'm doing the town halls I'm doing a town hall November first six PM and I'm doing a town hall November fourth at two PM\nPlease call or email me to get the I ... I got the venue pretty much locked down but I just want to make sure that everything's OK okay and I'm having that done today\nSo if you'd like to come and just kind of understand what this vote means why it's it's tricky and confusing as it is\nBecause there's people there and saying yes means you know that just means you know no means yeah there is a lot of confusion over this [laughter]\nSo I Am doing this town hall because these are the kinds of things\nThat affect you directly not indirectly directly\nThese kinds of things are going to affect how you live and how far do you live in your home with your family and your family's budget and cetera so I really want people to understand when they were voting on um election day in the first Tuesday in November\nWhat and why they're voting the way that they are and so come to my town hall if you're unable to come I Hope you are able to come but if you're unable to calm [laughter]\nUm I Will probably have a I Will have a pamphlet flyer\nI'm closer to the date so please pay attention to these things these are things the way I so I did five reduces yesterday by the way that I address just on the other shows is the way that you don't allow\nSomething light prop one twenty seven to affect you you and your family directly is\nProduced your own power on your own roof\nWhere you are making your free will and choice [laughter] how are you are taking control of a an essential bill no matter how high it goes you have to pay it now you've stopped that and once you're producing your own power on your roof\nATS massive peak and raise the rates once twice three times a year if they want and it's not going to affect you because you have all the power\nThat you need to consume being produced on your own roof and the way my formula works very different than a lot of other people's is your exporting power back in a PS and ... ... s R P\n... that there is a reason why we can't do that there because after P didn't want anybody going for seven years ago so they're super ... rates are like thirty eight cents in the summertime uh work with me\nYou're going to be paying somewhere between seven and half an eight and a half cents per kilowatt were not exporting back I Want you to consume everything\nName Donald stood up to a mom of toxic swamp creatures ten helped his fellow cave men take their government back that

that's available for immediate absorption\nYou know you mentioned that vitamin D is an oil so how were you able to make your formula into a fast melt\nOr question credits here's what I've done I've worked with an advantage team of scientists and these guys they know their stuff and they're using a technology to convert vitamin D which is an oil into a dry powder\nAnd once they knew that they put in the ass dissolving Mel for immediate action and quick results that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr ... from people that are taking your\nFast melt the three\nOh I'm getting to and the feedback you know I've got people that email me here's an email from Patty and she writes I was diagnosed with a severe vitamin D deficiency and she says she tried many other vitamin supplements\nOkay and then she discovered might be three and she said she went back to her doctor had a blood test and her blood tests on back into a normal range just within weeks\nWow All right folks that want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Pincus says vitamin D three formula there's a special toll free number for you to call\nIt's one eight

only available to you listeners so when you call\nIt's absolutely necessary and it's a hormone\nThat should be in the body and it's not there\nCan you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women who were studied\nAnd they found that the number one non combat\nReason that people died in the navy was due to the melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kinda pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck some shifts in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin\nCancer but then I read on Annan said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went home I thought it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone\nThe string ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a thing that people kind of feel like they're getting the physically and then it's a lack of flexibility you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nBerlin from side to side you wake up with your knees are hurting your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this in a setting in the church with a lack of vitamin D three my formula\nSo here's someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball muscle pain fibromyalgia I Would say on my formula like immediately and start thinking one or two of my ... three's a day\nFor the first week or two to get your thoughts as up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nCourse credit you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that the theme good to have a lot of sugar and gelatin wax and my thing it's not what you take it for what your body absorb\nWhat I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy your sleep your outlook your mood\nAnd then after being for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like a little bit younger crashed\nAnd who wouldn't want that and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of result to be seen\nWell one of the surprising one would I gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr paint gives his vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid result\nIn by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improve balance stronger muscles and fewer aches and pains and again keep in mind that Dr ... says arranged a very special offer this only available to your listeners today so when you do call pleased to be sure to mention this program and you're going to get a risk free trial\nOf Dr ... says vitamin D three again this is only available to your listeners\nAnd only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one

in mind folks you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr ... says vitamin D three formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back\nAnd when you do call and order you're not going to be enrolled in one of those automatic monthly subscription programs this is a one time order so I encourage you the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor six seven zero zero five three I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for six seven zero zero five three\n[noise] so how about if folks to me what it really comes down to here as we're not getting the right form or enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr\nBiggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin lead to vitamin D three and the two is the title of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body until three converted into vitamin D three ... three is the\nAccelerator form so it's ready to go to work now than he treated at using my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lot more of the people in the lab of taking this cat and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof or should be\nWhile so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short developments and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for\nPregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties so I you know you start taking more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start telling her you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on a formula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and\nClarity you know this is the more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr bank is such that your fast meld these three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath all the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from lack of the vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like that\nAnd the sooner you can get on my formula better you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high mobility life from here on out\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and documenting is what can somewhat expect when they start taking your fast melts the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first survivor oh is that something is changing your body because the kick start so many different cycles in your body that you'll start having less chains have more energy\nAnd having a better mental clarity better sleep your mood can be affected by this vitamin D three is necessary to get these things running\nWell Dr biggest slum fortunately we only have a few minutes left to anything else you want to share with her audience here in our final minutes\nFor those of you listening covered a lot of around you work in the body is tricky as you know and we're talking to your listeners have your show\nYou know there are all walks of life but all the various conditioned and so I'm trying to get some good health that vice chair for the point is and get yourself out of it get yourself on its formula and see for yourself it becomes law for you to try something to see if it works\nBut it's an interesting thought we\nWere talking about nutrition we're not talking about rocket science here right a lot of science behind what I'm Talking about the key is to get\nOn that formula and give it a month or two every day take one of the Senate and start the improvements and you're paying your blood pressure your blood sugar energy or sleep habits this is my appeal to your listeners to get on its formula to try it for themselves\nWell Dr bank is again thank you for taking time to uh to be with us today thank you Chris\nAlright folks will here is your final opportunity if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there's a special toll free number for you to call it's one eight hundred\nCredit for five hundred and eight dollars and thirty four cents I Will keep

behind us you better think again the truth is that viruses colds and the flu can strike almost any time of the year which is exactly why you should be doing everything you can\nTo protect yourself no matter what time of year it is\nSo what's the best way to protect yourself from these nasty viruses the colds and the flu\nWell here today to share his health secret for shielding against viruses colds and the flu is Dr Michael Pincus\nDr bank is is great to see it again Chris it's great to be here you know most of you probably know the doctor and it gives us a nationally recognized authority on both natural and alternative health he's also very successful chiropractor he's been sought out by top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns so Dr biggest what is this how secret that you've been talking about\nWell what the secret is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C. vitamin C. All right well uh vitamin C is is not really new though no vitamin C is not new\nBut it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell\nAnd unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends in the bottom line is with out enough fight him and see and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system compromise you're more prone to cancer heart attacks cataracts allergies\nDiabetes the list goes on and on and\nAccording to several studies your life could be short and by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contains about sixty five milligrams of vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three to four thousand yeah and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice\nSo because of lack of vitamin C. they were getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick well what do you mean by that well the number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his\nDoctor you know I just don't eat energy I don't feel like myself I'm hurting yeah and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go all we've got to do this task send you through the scanner and the problem is is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd what's interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C. alright the other ones are any pigs primates and the fruit bat\nWhen you look at the rest of the animals out there\nYou don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure you don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness all the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day some animals like a goat\nYeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it\nYeah right but you know I think most people myself included thinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is that\nYou know what it is actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my supersede twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down to have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it and I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms of vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize they were different forms of\nVitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... is your body needs different forms of it and I put it all into one\nVitamin formula now and you said there was how much vitamin C. and you're a super see Tony to four years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what what are some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're going experiences energy vitamin C. produces energy in the body there are studies showing that vitamin C. helps the person in pain\nCardiovascular issues allergies unexplained waking diabetics need vitamin C. the list goes on and on I have a number of patients and clients that are using it\nAnd I brought some emails is it okay if I read an email to sure sure um this is one of my clients from Tallahassee his name's Ron okay listen to this after three days of being a super see his blood pressure dropped\nIt he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days you know another thing that happened is I became more alert and I now have a clear head off and vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it\nThe average life expectancy went up six years wow that's really amazing\nI Want to let your listeners know that if you want to get a free book about vitamin C. N. try Dr ... says supersede twenty two formula absolutely risk free there is a special toll free number to call it's one eight hundred to zero eight\nI've been used as a slur\nOf sorts sometimes even against those in the administration often with anti Semitic over tell\nBy the way I like him to give an example of where the president has ever used the word globalized with an anti Semitic overtone\nJust happen to these dark I leave sorry go on\nJust happen to make the president come right out and embrace nationalism\nWhile solving for some money one called the single biggest liar someone whom Trump wants implied was not sufficiently American due to his foreign birth\nMakes strange bed okay or wait wait wait okay wait wait a minute you know this disappoints me 'cause I've only had good relations with Don Lemon\nHe he he said that Ted Cruz would not sufficiently American because of his foreign birth no he said that he might not be able to be a candidate for president because of foreign birth that doesn't make you insufficiently American\n... how can how can we see that I\n[noise] without\n... wanting to insult the um [noise] I just want to say left for the left truth is just not a value it's not like they think oh I'm going to line now it's like it doesn't matter\nI mean I remember that Ted Cruz\nIs orders Ted Cruz was he born in Canada was that the or was that the issue and and that is it to make you insufficiently Americans it means that you're not\nQualified to run for for for office so watched or for president I should say yeah killed the ... the okay go on please politics\nMakes strange bedfellows tapas upgraded his nickname for Texas Senator Ted Cruz from lying to add to be able to protest\nHis one of many stump speech as the president is making for them in terms about which seems\n\nBut when the president's son in law and senior advisor was asked about Republicans' chances he was a bit more guarded [noise]\nI don't know I mean I I some mixed data the data that we let that shows that it's all about the turnout model so I think people who have different turnout laws will show different things but one thing I've learned is I I wouldn't bet against Trump or a black swan seems to have ... his wife\nSo a black swan a statistical anomaly defined as an occurrence or phenomenon that comes as a surprise because it was not predict it or was hard to predict\nCertainly no one\nCould have predicted this president\nThe way I just want to say I'm a I'm a little amazed at the that Jared Kushner was not declared a racist for using the term black swan I I I really to be honest most expecting that go on place\nSo it's bringing now Mr Frank Bruni awesome as Susan Glasser and Michael the Tony ... author of\nThe doubt from through in a is one of the time it was it a theme frankly accent when he heard the president's ... top president lane aside admitting that you know what I hold on a hat if their show on hold on hold on I I Would have liked\nTo seeing Frank Bruni is reaction I really would see for me uh is New York times that of opinion columnist Columbus and their contempt for those of us it's contempt you meet analyze\nAnalyze analyze the left view of the novel left\nIs moral superiority you that's the reason for the plural balls that is the reason for the cling to their guns and religion and that's the that's a big part of the reason for the loading unloading of Donald Trump\nBecause they're seen as they're inferior as I wrote this column a few weeks ago it's critical but you ... the leftist as ... they are above the normal rules and they have\nA spectacular spectacular self image that's why the the left invented the self esteem movement\nThey are very very high self esteem so yes she probably has this look of

my family is I Am not a solar company I Am I'm there to do my best work for you become an energy expert some people call me an energy I'm advocate a consumer advocate\nUm I'm actually friday I'm meeting with one of the board of directors of one of the electric companies because I get some pretty I'm pretty important information that it's not privy to the public ... um [noise] a pass just had a rate increase so guess who is getting ready to have a a another rate increase um it's the other electric company\nSo I go out and I find out accurate information and for for my homeowners my family's because my goal is to put\nMore of my family's hurt her money back into their pocket not the electric company a piss me four hundred and eighty eight million dollars last year in profits [laughter]\nWhat do you think their profits did this year when they rolled out these new rape plan and we haven't even seen the end of this year yet it's it's just it's astronomically ridiculous and you know we worked so hard to to own our own homes\nUm and we come home at the end of the day\nAnd we want to live comfortably but we need to live affordably in in our own homes and now\nThe power company has to be asked me to tell us that the hottest time of day between three and eight PM so whether you are retired and your home in the daytime or you're working and you're coming home at five thirty six o'clock there getting you they they know you're going to be using electricity and that's the most expensive power but they're charging us for\nI Want to help as many families as I can understand this because this has never been about just slapping solar panels on your roof [noise]\nUm it was my daughter almost ended up being a bad fuller story and I was watching out for her and if I hadn't of had the ability to create this formula and like kill all worksheet you're going to tell people how to go so that I ... my daughter would have ended up being a bad filler story\nUm there's lots of them out there there's lots of people calling me sane Sandy I went with this company in that company can you please help me I don't want to see families I'm going down a road that that that they're not going to have the maximum benefits and saving if\nIt's a you know if you're working with a company and he won a second opinion you get a second opinion when you're having a surgery or medical opinion that this is just as important this is your family's home this year power source if you're on the right track I'm going to say great you're on the right track there's enough business out there for everybody\nBut if you're not going to explain why you're not and what my recommendation is to you so please this is not something that you do lightly and you don't do without thorough\nResearch and sitting down with\nA you know I Am I have become an energy expert in this particular field because it all started with my daughter my daughter's home we were my grandchildren lived I needed to make sure that it was going to work because\nThat was my daughter common where my grandchildren ... and the other reason was\nCouldn't afford to help her ... her power bill if it didn't work so I take the same formula that I utilized for my daughter's home\nAnd that's the formula that I use for every one of my family's homes that work with me\nAnd that's why I'm so proud to be able to show people\nThe evidence of my work and with these new rate plans and everything the bills are starting to come in I'm asking my family to send them they're going to be up on my website we're putting up their prom but please go fill out your kill worksheet it only takes a minute Jeremy is going to tell you in a minute how to go to my Web site\nAnd if you have questions I I really really like when people ask me a lot of questions I Want you to understand that I Want to understand\nHow your bill works now I Want you to understand how you will be saving money when you are no longer

you're just\nWant to give them a call do six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine about six to three eight five zero eighty two twenty nine and yeah the website you go you see right up there that kilowatt worksheet you click on it and you're starting right there that is the best way to start\nAnd get it going because again you want\nTo be saying we're going through all these bills and I'm seeing your payment main zero point zero zero\nThey're not paying their savings so much money but like you said it's one thing at three o'clock where you want to come home you want to get the AC on you want to start the laundry you want to get the dishes and you want to go to dinner you want to cook dinner I can watch TV he wanted\nHe want to be able to live comfortably in your own home Jeremy [noise] you know a savings are there I I I really can support the savings but again it's about living more comfortably in your own home and still we we had one ... one of the most significant rate increases this year actually there was a two part increased\nFirst part was rolled out last year and the second part they snuck it in may first calling in New rape plant a PS kind of does things like that\nAnd then they give us an accurate information when we call and they make recommendations oh that plan is very similar to your other plan now they're nowhere similar they're nowhere close [laughter] they're selling us to stay in power only they're selling it differently more extensively to us and if we think this is the last increase or the last\nUm [noise] the thing that's going to impact our the cost of our power here in Arizona we are sorely sorely mistaken\nUm let's talk about um I Am doing a town hall when things one of the things that is going to impact our power costs dramatically is everybody's been hearing about prop one twenty seven\nSo yes I don't know the and the signs all over the oh my gosh and then you see the ads one says yes one says no\nAnd okay I'm not going to get into it on the air and that's why I'm doing the town halls I'm doing a town hall\nNovember first six PM and I'm doing a town hall November fourth at two PM please call or email me to get the I got the venue pretty much locked down but I just want to make sure that everything's a okay and I'm having that done today\nSo if you'd like to come and just kind of understand what this vote means why it's is tricky and confusing as it is\nBecause there's people in and saying yes means you didn't just means you know no means yet there is a lot of confusion over this [laughter] so I Am doing this town hall because these are the kinds of things\nThat affect you directly not indirectly directly\nThese kinds of things are going to affect how you live and how far do you live in your home with your family and your family's budget and cetera so really want people to understand when they were voting on um election day in the ... to stay in November what\nAnd why they're voting the way that they are and so come to my town hall if you're unable to come by hopes you are able to come but if you're unable to calm [laughter] um I Will probably have a I Will have a pamphlet flyer

vitamin it's official maybe a few other things\nGo into the streets super high nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nWell at the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd extract from red wine called ... and apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigated they use in their host countries though I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor Rick I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in\nIndia and seeing all of that and with resume or a trial I've worked with scientists in Europe and also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to\nInvestigate these things in the field and meet with the top scientists and my conclusion is that green tea\n... came in from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from in a very very substantial way\nNow of course let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and or considered super feeds the green tea ... there was very ... why do you want to combine to read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other works better you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to\nPut them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kinda like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich\nIn groups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidant so they actually retired\nThe aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial in one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nLet's dive into the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press I Know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity and have blood due to sign on to recap some of these headlines of show me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing\nClass my antioxidant activity\nIs really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume don't actually\nWind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood and concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants\nSubstances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure\nTo environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue to thigh on so you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to fire on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant\nFoods or supplementing greedy and sue but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nBut they still might want the benefits of three of the biggest superstar protective health enhancing nutrients on the entire planet so when I call this a daily short\nCut I'm simply saying that you can get in a good liquid soft gelatin capsule you otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking
