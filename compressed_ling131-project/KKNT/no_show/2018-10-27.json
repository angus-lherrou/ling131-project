{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "It is it is appropriate not to blame Donald Trump for this job\nAnd there are people on both sides who say crazy stuff and do crazy stuff and ... say stuff that should be withdrawn and has an inappropriate\nBut for goodness sake what one of the things that congressman Jackie Speier said today and she said uh it's the same thing it's the same thing here one comes after the other as President Trump explodes verbal bombs and uh and his opponents\nAnd then uh this bomb or say op\nHe uh he builds real bombs to explode at his opponents can we get something very very clear here there's a difference between verbal bombs\nAnd real bombs you remember that uh that old child and union yeah a sticks and stones will break your bones but names will never hurt you I'm a yeah\nThat's that's true when it comes to physical pain and there's there's generally unless you're calling from violence against somebody which by the way this individual says are say I may have done\nWhen you're calling for physical violence against somebody that can be a crime\nBut if you're just saying someone is a loser it's fake news or someone who's dishonest or if someone is such a disgrace okay it may not be nice\nNot the right thing to do to use your ability of your right of free speech for that\nPurpose but it's not criminal harming people exploding bombs at people that's that's criminal obviously one\nEight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number or let's go to your calls and to Dee in Pittsburgh D. or on the Michael Mann that show\nThat I'm tired of hearing that from the old man\n... had an inch somebody in of hay and he ... the there is he going to be honest you know where that happened I so I I remember during the campaign he went home whatever he's from withholding already far his followers and a bunch of that state's mall came into the stadium\nAnd throwing it some thought to speak yeah Russia to that point and I'm sure I'll show you could not speak\nI Need to then get them out of here for one God grab one of them and what side for him off another one of them a punch one of ... for for border I plan on fat on ... ... ...\nYou're not sure I'm I'm not sure that your narrative D is exactly the way it happened but you're right there was a situation in California\nWhere there are a bunch of Trump supporters outside of the stadium where he was speaking who were assaulted by demonstrators on the other side and yes this is stupid and there was an attempt I went and culture was supposed to be speaking at University of California\nAre they actually did property damage and they riot it and are there is no question that the left has been far more guilty of actual violence\nTrying to shut down free speech then their rights far more guilty of it I've never heard of a case in the last stove fifty years of people on the right shutting down any speaker at a college campus\nHappens all the time from the left appreciate your call or let's go quickly to John in Olympia, Washington John you're on the ...\nYou know it is telling how how you're acting right now because if it had been a as a democratic order Dole\nTalking heads I Would be this as a a false flag and and you mentioned earlier in my mind as you mentioned earlier that Trump spoke and he said he didn't want violent and terror effect to take root in America\nTrump is reaping what he so he he he is doing nothing but a a that this guy was a a a Trump supporter not far right weight\nAnd it needs to be excluding like that Mike and you should be way at first and foremost thing but it will hold on hold on for a moment ...\n... again you're not saying things that are untrue but you're saying things that are disconnected in other words it as Trump's slogan irresponsibly in the past from time to time he does but ... there is no connection\nAnd at no point to Trump's ... anything like a I Hope these people die and do you remember what what part of what this reminds me of and I'll I'll tell you I'm reminded of it\nIs this guy on his van had sites are put on showing a a um a target from a crosshairs from a gun the sites on the faces of people he dislikes Michael Moore and Van Jones and Hillary Clinton\nAnd you remember when Gabby Giffords was shot and she ended up being shot by somebody was on the left who was pro marijuana legalization is basically and not but he was on the left\nAnd um and and people try to associate that with Sarah Palin\nWho said that there are certain congressional seats that we should target to pick up and they had put a that none of our picture of Gabby Giffords but over a a map that showed her congressional seat that's just stretching it and and trying to criminalize opposition [noise] which I think his poisonous we'll be right back [noise]\nWhy your old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American lives destroyed by our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy is real cool hand in for so long that fully funds President Trump's border wall expands caseload penalizing them an illegal immigrants and insurers only of American citizens have the right move over to\nConservative solution of America deserves\nThe leadership of President Trump's\nBuild a wall didn't force the law\nRather than Trump visited time for the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is ... ball and enforce the law\nPay for my safety for the express [noise]\nTo live or a very important message about this radio station in my sixties a patriot by shooting spree or you've\nHeard me talk about the American trinity for some of them in God we trust liberty the three things go set the United states for some horrible idea that as a news radio station is a place for ... years principles fries every day you never forget the faith and freedom of part of what our country's\nSection there were some people would find ways to apologize for America about stopping this radio station will ever just when you listen to nine sixty the Patriot we promise not to insult you intelligence industry ... will for\nFor ... over right this is what our radio stations all about as long as you're there to listen to us we'll be here for you you still you know friends of mine\nActually sell our sponsors you appreciate their support\nThe radio station and tell us your thought nine sixty patriotic [noise]\nI'm a firefighter training I'm a former I'm a barber shop on mom\nWe're all part of the community every day we live in and out of each other's is Eli\nHaiti take for granted I'm a little mom and make up our everyday somewhat good others not so much\nMe to a new variant in low maintenance or\nOr some of the evening\nThese are the moments and take a monsoon\nCaffeine something that's\nIt's not about paranoia more be unafraid\nStanding out there protecting our community one detail more out of time because a lot of detail and can become an arena we we trust I think just like you should because only you know we're not supposed to be in your every dang\nSurf protector every day\nThe from the local assigning\n\nWhy do you have the greatest show on the planet\nAnd on the Michael ... show I've referred a couple of times on this show to um [noise] things that President Trump has tweeted that [noise] that I think are not constructive uh this is a tweet from a couple of days ago before they solve this a crime\nThe series of crimes actually President Trump tweeted a very big part of the anger anger capitalized we see today in our society has caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting\nOf the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description\n\nOn many says mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fast all capitalized with an exclamation point\nUm [noise]\nWhat's my big problem there were just one word which is purposeful purposely false\nAmerican culture is so much on the show\nAnother very day in his greatest nation on God's green earth and it's always a great day when you can come into a weekend with great news to celebrate and it is great news for America is great news for\nRepublicans for Democrats for independence for people who don't care about politics at all\nThe perpetrator of that horrible bomb scare with fourteen different explosive devices mailed around the country\nAlleged perpetrator has been apprehended and he has been interrogated the proof is accumulating\nAnd the prospect does he will be going away for some forty years but meanwhile the president of the United states charged as\nEarlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to you for a few moments or with a a friend and somebody who I I'm view as a very significant ally\nFor constitutional causes his name is Michael Ferris he is the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom and uh and and Mike we were just talking off the air for a moment\nOr I think we agree then one of the essential elements of trying to\nTo reduce the levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition what'd you\nSure the the historical American position has been I may disagree with everything you say it all depends on the right to say it\nAnd we're losing that left in particular [noise] although there are some of the right to take this position but the left with the levers of power like jak Philips case where they tried to shut down it crushes Baker who didn't want to use his creative skills to speak a message in favor of same sex weddings\nAnd and the California case that we did in the spring were last year or California to force pro life centers to give a pro abortion message [noise] people aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say that freely they ... at you know\nCan we go to the California case for a moment because all of that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory which seems to mean for the alliance defending freedom\nOr this one is I I've spoken several times for fundraising banquets for um for crisis pregnancy centers and would crisis pregnancy centers tried to do is to give people an alternative\nIn a crisis pregnancy is where a very often people are and marry they have no funds\nThat rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion\nOr that the centers will help you ... the bear the child raising a child and and deal with all the challenges in ... and they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion services [laughter]\nGo go to this address go here do there um and that's about right isn't\n[noise] yes um I argued the case in the Supreme Court myself and you got it exactly right California's real they were asked to in their papers passing a law that this is a part of the progressive issues to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere I'm\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on abortion if if if you were on\nOur side of the issue of the other side of course I wasn't required the ... the Planned Parenthood has not affected by this law it was only they claim that they only wanted all women to have all the news well didn't work that way\nRight and and be just to get this so people see it so clearly in other words you would have been fine with is is that a Planned Parenthood day and said well if you want an alternative to abortion and then go to a crisis pregnancy center\nIn equal actually I Would have ... I Would take the position that Planned Parenthood shouldn't be forced to give our message and we shouldn't be forced to give the pro abortion message\nBut then the lack of a quality shows what the real problem here is is that people want to silence\nViewpoint that they don't agree with and I think that that's that's where the lack of civility is really coming in and it's we're saying that the other people don't even have a valid point of view I mean we can there's a difference between saying\nI'm you know your time to express your view and saying I agree with your view and you know it's it's okay to disagree in this country but to some people are not allowed to disagree anymore and they will silence you if you disagree with the progressive viewpoint\nWhat uh what is the story going on right now with Blaine Adams and who is the ... does emotional T shirts a case\nCases pending in the Kentucky Supreme Court [noise] um the local officials there went after him because he wouldn't print T shirts with the gay pride to them\nAnd he will print teachers for any person but he won't go overall message is there's other messages eastern down over the years\nHe found them another T shirt shop to deliver the exact same shirt and the exact same price but that wasn't good enough it wasn't that they wanted to be entitled to have their shirts which they clearly God\nThey wanted to have a pound of flesh to go with it and so they're trying to punish plane out of ... and and hopefully we won that case in the court of appeals [noise] um and hopefully that will be for him to the Kentucky Supreme Court if if not\nWe'll be taking that keeps us for it\nI I just saw an unbelievable number um how how many uh different attorneys do you put out in the field to defend these cases with the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nThat we have a sixty attorneys on staff and three thousand allied attorneys that I'm going to hear their time sometimes it reduced rate sometimes absolutely free but we have a big team that are willing to come in and and help Christians and other people all over the country\nWho have real religious freedom and freedom of speech problems\nWell that's a that's a very a very significant um army if you have the three thousand volunteer attorneys\nAnd by the way what we're talking to you because right now today is friday we are going into the weekend you will feel great and you'll have more reason to celebrate and feel grateful over the weekend if you can do something to um\nTo help the alliance defending freedom go to our website at Michael midday dot com you can read more about their fascinating work and some of these important cases\nAnd see what this great organization led by Michael ...

you're born in the United states the chances are very large that\nYou have at least one generation maybe two maybe three maybe ten generations of people work very hard for this country\nAnd that gives you more of a right than people born abroad\nTo enjoy the blessings of this country isn't that basic isn't that sensible\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd then making ... concedes a truly open borders policy has no constituency in the American electorate but it's the implicit philosophical framing of most news media stories on immigration\nWhich tend to focus on the micro problems of the individuals not the macro problem of just how many of those individuals the country can admit\nShe says this is easy to\nSay no of course we can't let in every single person who wants to come because doing so well transformed this country\nInto one the few Americans of any political persuasion would want to live in the United states would be vastly more unequal and income and opportunity migrants would languishing the kind of squalid poverty\nThat the United states hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably a conservative estimate that would defeat any conceivable tax and transfer program\nOkay this is the core argument simply allowing people in is a disaster for the country and it's not a a blessing for the people who are allowed in because\nBy encouraging more and more and more and more immigration with no limit\nWhat you're doing is undermining undermining the vitality and prosperity and opportunity that those people

Michael midday dot com\nAnd on the Michael ... show will uh posed this Megan McCarthy column that I'm Talking about are the immigration\nConversation we need to have it's called and it's basically a conversation and makes it clear we cannot have an open borders policy it if there is no constituency for it it's something that by the way conservatives use more than liberals not because conservatives supported the because they characterize\nThe liberal position as being for open borders and you know to some extent\nIt is only because on this caravan issue have you heard anything from anyone on the left anyone in the Democratic party\nAbout what they propose to do about it all you hear his criticism of Trump oh Trump said that there were middle Easterners and the caravan and they're not probably not probably right that he's wrong but okay so what ... ... as Meghan McConnell makes the point even if every single person in this caravan\nIs solid and hardworking and decent family oriented you cannot just accepted by parents the caravan has dwindled down to about three thousand people which is good news\nBecause it means that there's some people were finding some kind of asylum or some kind of ability be taken in Mexico maybe some all go back to Honduras\nAnd and that it seems to me is an area where Americans can be helpful both a private sector and the public sector they're wonderful charities one of the things that I'm very proud of\nHis we'd been associate on the show and I I mentioned this last night in Minneapolis a we've been associated for years with food for the poor which does a\nA great job feeding people and providing for people in Guatemala and by helping\nWith no permission and NO PLAN and a ... frankly cutting all foreign aid to those countries\nWould make it harder to stop the advance of future caravans now are these caravans organized by George Soros know are they organized by leftist politicians in Honduras absolutely and it's reported in the New York times and everywhere else\nAnd the idea that that somehow Democrats want to use this as a political issue suggesting that we have to show some kind of\nA welcoming\nTo people who are desperate who were decided to march up to the United states nowhere else they they wanted to go there probably places where they could establish themselves more successfully and more immediately but\nThe United states backing us and we simply cannot cannot uh allow that\nFact that the people want to come here to allow people who wanted to come here who are willing to force the issue let's go to a Kurt in Minneapolis ... you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Vick uber kicking recalled a great really good question I ... I couldn't occur more ...

is not a sincere Trump supporter is bogus it's ridiculous they going back to look at his\nEntire Facebook history and his Facebook history going back until two thousand Fifteen is all about Trump and lots and lots of Trump for president he's posted big excerpts of Trump's speech at a rally\nAnd he has this van he may have been living in ... in it\nSome residents Ventura reported of\nSeeing a similar white van covered in pro Trump stickers\nOften part in a lot of a local strip mall\nAnd somebody who saw that van who's a documentary film producer and editor\nNamed David ... can set it struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows it was unsettling and also it seemed to be occupied in other words some and living there sometimes the door would be a jar or window would be open which indicated to me that maybe someone was living in the van\nPresident Trump has spoken very appropriately he said these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country we must never allow political violence to take root in America he was just outside the White House moments ago and they shouted a question at the president\nWould you yourself pledge Mr President to tone down the rhetoric for the next few days\nAnd here's what the president said he said I think I've been toned down if you want to know the truth that is the truth is he has been toned down in the last few days but then he added this he said I could really tone it up because there's you know the media has been extremely unfair to me into the Republican Party\n[noise] um do you know can we play because we should for President Trump my a grand daughter's favorite song which is let it go she doesn't really know the lyrics she just knows that and she knows let it\nGo let it go let it go let it go\nOkay she doesn't sing as she's not to yet but President Trump should get the message of between now and election day\n[noise] I I don't think that winning in these clothes districts that we have to win because otherwise the Democrats are going to take control of the house of representatives\nUh I I don't think it helps to continually go after media and to suggest that they are deliberately lying\nAnd now they get stories where all the time they show by us all the time but the idea of deliberately making things up and lying\nThe president tweeted a very big part of the anger we\nSee today in our society has caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news\nIt has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast they\nDo try to clean up their act when they get things wrong I Am very very often they will apologize I there was an outrageous story early in the Trump Administration\nI'm sure many of you remember where they were reporting in time magazine that the president of the United states had ordered the removal of a bust of Martin Luther king that never happened it didn't exist and within four hours after posting that story they apologize and took it down\nAnd it's outrageous that they made the mistake in the first place and there's no excuse for it but at least you respond the same way when you move back\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I actually believe that politically this thing should buy writes benefit to president of the United states I'll tell you why\nBecause people said they were so worried about Trump weakening the FBI people are worried about it they should build backup confidence about the FBI\nAnd may have injured and\nThen he was arrested in two thousand four for possession of a controlled substance without a prescription and within tend to sell\nSounds like selling perhaps painkillers perhaps opioids in Nineteen Ninety One\nI pleaded guilty to a charge of their degree grand theft and was sentenced to a fine and two years' probation is there something wrong with our criminal justice system if a guy who is this dysfunctional is not actually sent to prison\nA woman named ... filed a civil complaint against they opt for domestic violence in Nineteen Ninety four\nHe also has a history of financial troubles can't imagine why a two bedroom two bath house\nHe owned in Fort Lauderdale was foreclosed in two thousand nine three years after he\nPurchased that say I filed for bankruptcy in two thousand twelve now all of this is terribly sad\nIt's it's very very sad but it I think defeats the frankly cop Khamenei narrative that\nThis is somehow a democratic stunt and the the best proof to me that it's not a democratic stunt will be the fact that\nIt will have no impact on the polls and will have no impact on the election what will have an impact on the election of President Trump and his administration performing well\nIn protecting us and identifying this guy and apprehending him and now bringing him to some kind of justice\nLet's go to Matt Mesa, Arizona Matt you're on the man that show\nAnd Michael thanks for having me on your um look\nHey I I totally understand how it can sound cocky media can sound crazy but the way the world is right now I think it's a woman in the whole thing when we say that things like CNN the fake news\nBut they don't operate from a place of 'em just irrationality sometimes when they called people like\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center and and there are ... members for doing a you know war justice work social justice work I wait wait I've never\nI've never heard CNN describe antifa as doing social justice work and try to describe themselves as social justice warriors and that's your job or their sucks but I've never heard I've never heard CNN or MSNBC or any major mainstream media source say that end teeth all was good guys\nWell at least the the point that I'm trying to make is they're not out clearly making them out to be the bad guy and the people who are the the voice that they have on their network at least hold them to a high regard and they're not shutting down and and I totally understand that but\nThat that you look I think what you're saying is true I think there's a profound biased throughout media news and it's it's very very biased and they they certainly treat neo Nazis a much more harshly or Proud Boys much more harshly than\nThey train antifa anti deserves just the same kind of contempt and just the same kind of criticism but that's different from making things up\nThey are and and to say that people are deliberately fabricating stories is a very different charge we'll be

I that I I really like\nStuffed a wise guy America\nTo hyper sophisticated fools that um habits so many of our urban areas that are have gone to graduate school too long and become stupid\nSo that's my that's my initial take\nI hey everybody not just stupid callous jaded mean but other than that I think okay producing terrific people yeah\nBeen be so what is it now seven thousand have you seen pictures of the caravan coming in from largely from Honduras\n\nLike to talk to somebody about how many uh how how did they get through the Mexican border the Mexicans just don't care I I keep hearing conflicting reports that it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred forty years at seven thousand [noise]\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question is how did they just have such a large group get through Mexico not that I think Mexico cares\nA substantial part of their population lives in the United states and funds Mexico makes them back billions of dollars and\nWe take the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially were a no ... government of Mexico and the United states and the left thinks that that is a terrific thing even though all it does is enable the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are unhappy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in the significance compared to the possibility\nOf more Democrats\nBecause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections that's what they do the imports Democrats\nMet an amazing thing is that done anywhere else in the world and the democracy we import millions of people in order to have you will like that that's what it's about\nAnd they it's a it's a big question we should have some folks on because the big question here how are they going to be stopped she misses me my fear is is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people but not going to come to the border and they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back ... thousand miles or was Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what the\nDistances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSeats are fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to ... that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSee they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just prefer California 'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches as a hunter is just not landlocked to the best of my knowledge\nSo I I don't ah [laughter] you have\nTo live in this make believe world that are on the left is created there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral way to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to flee vast numbers won a fleet they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful or equally wonderful or non wonderful culture get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated to\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin American the American culture\nThat's amazing I guess while you are so many Americans fleeing to hunger us why should they be why should they be impoverished they have food they've perfectly perfectly acceptable\nNatural resources\nThe reason Latin America is largely an economic failure is because it was largely\nCorrupt ask our friends in Brazil\nIs is is there a few as ... as in television industry is people was the Brazilians\nBut they're mired in corruption corruption is is the greatest problem outside of Iran on the face of the earth\n\nRock global warming my friend's corruption but nobody wants to talk about it because it sounds like you are attacking another culture but I Am attacking another culture\nI'm not attacking another race or another ethnicity or race or ethnicity or insignificant culture is everything\nSo I I don't know what will happen at the border I I don't know how they will be stopped they have but otherwise if you want them in that you are aligned to yourself and to everybody else if you deny your for open borders seven thousand people want to come in\nThat seven thousand more voters plus there plus their families the this is for the Democrats this is awesome\nI listened to the political pundits who are are divided on this list will be seen being good I mean we're approaching this hugely hugely nation changing election possibly\nThe American people choose a Democratic House you are going to just see a two years of hate filled investigation and some of the

United states has to protect the sovereignty it's better for Republicans\nThat's the answer but the point is they will undoubtedly be somebody will get hurt I it's very hard to imagine no young man has gone a scuffle with any American border enforcement agent and then get hurting and perhaps a child they will be more cameras there as many cameras there was\nPeople and then they they will be or they will be the usual from the left look at what look at the mean spirited president that we have\nLooked at these men and women and children though it's mostly young men but look at these men women and children the callous missing Gina phobia of this administration that's that's what you hear\nAnd they will they will have the you know the appropriate assigned or so appropriate images that they will be able to show\nOn CNN and MSNBC ABC CBS Seventy or B is BP beep beep beep beep beep beep you\nThat's what it is\nA question of do you believe in the right of a country to have brought people

if anything we've talked about is of interest to you you don't want to be procrastinating any longer maybe you've been looking and thinking that you need to get a second opinion on what you're doing

number one eight hundred\nSeven six seven Fifteen fifty nine it's our road map to overviews your entire financial situation and the first step is making that call and a member of my team will schedule a ten minute phone call with one of our credential for these years and you'll be able to discuss with one of our financial advisors\nExactly what's going on in your life and if we think we can help you or not some value will then schedule a sixty minutes sit down at one of our offices where you could expand a little bit on what's important to you none of which costs any money will build up an entire roadmap free of charge because we're passionate about helping you understand\nThese principles it's too important and mistakes are too high so call right now one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine to get that number as one eight hundred seven six seven one five five nine\nKey there is never good convenient time to make the sacrifice of saving it's far too easy to put things off until later practice procrastination let me investigate the cost of procrastination a little more deeply\nIf you're Twenty years old and you want to raise a hundred grand by age sixty five again assuming that ten percent rate of return you realize you only need to save get this\nThirteen hundred and Seventy two dollars today so if you're Twenty years on you put one thousand three hundred and Seventy two dollars away today it will be an average rate of return it ten percent it will be a hundred grand at age sixty five\nIt's crazy right it's almost a hundred times what you put in however if you're fifty today and you want a hundred grand you need to invest nearly twenty four thousand to obtain the same so instead of Thirteen hundred you have to put away twenty four grand [noise]\nThis is the cost of procrastination\n... it's not money that makes you financially successful it's time it's not timing the market it's time in the market\nThat makes you successful I mean think about that the number one thing here she still what partners when I'm discussing things with clients in talking with clients and we're working with a lot of folks who are you know near enter enter in retirement will definitely work with some young professionals and business owners but I get the sort of this unique vantage point of talking with a lot of folks that are in their fifties and sixties\nAnd you know what the number one\nSort of regret and complained and reflection that many of our clients have when we're looking at their situation\nThe number one thing they say is I Wish I had started sooner I wished so badly I had understood this when I was in my twenties and thirties even my forties I would've helped so much because I mean think about that you need a little over a grand today if you're twenty\nTo have a hundred grand at retirement I mean think about how easy that is when you get the power of compound interest but again\nWe have to recognize rubber cross later so here's something practical a couple of practical things I Would tell you about saving the first one I think many of you realize this the first is really just automating your savings okay what\nThis means is turn things on auto pilot obviously if you're saving into a retirement plan at work it comes out of your paycheck you should automate all of your outside same in investing in the same way\nRight nowadays with online banking as a super simple just you can easily set up savings plans investment plans where they come out at whatever you want and they transfer money to the various accounts we do this for all of our clients\nIt's incredibly important because we are procrastinators if you have to proactively get out your checkbook which I mean shoot if you're a millennial you don't even know what a checkbook is probably but\nWe're not going to write a check every month like we're not going to do it the money's going to be gone you have to get it out of there and pay yourself before anything else happens just pretend you don't even have the money put it on auto pilot another really easy way to save money which we practice personally Brittany and I do is anytime you get unexpected money\nThat you weren't planning on getting just immediately deposit that into your investment account you will be amazed over the course of five or ten years how much money\nYou actually were able to squirrel away\nMoney you're not expecting right the last thing is every time you get a raise that work as you continue to progress in your career you may make more money you may have the benefit of getting some raises are earning more money here's the easiest way to manage those raises\nTake half of the race and save it right so if you're making a hundred grand right now and you get a raise and are going to make one twenty five\n... twelve five and invested\nSpend the other twelve five so enjoy it like give yourself the benefit of being able to increase your lifestyle a little bit and you know enjoy the fruits of your labor in your hard work because there is a balance between saving and enjoying stuff now I mean what's the point in you know stashing up a bunch of money and it just dying with this big account that you've never enjoyed or did anything with so that's a really easy practical way every\nTime you get a raise said half of it because you you're not gonna miss it you didn't have it before anyways plus you get to increase your lifestyle\nIt's a great way to kind of battle procrastination so number one again number one automate all your savings\nKnow you're a procrastinator the first step to you know healing is admitting so just know that you're a procrastinator automated number to save anything that's unexpected you get something that you weren't expecting maybe a tax refund you were thinking of an old money on your taxes you got three thousand back\nDon't go spend it just immediately put an investment account number three every time you get a pay increase or raise save half of it\nAnd I'd like to offer the next five colors the opportunity to come in and get our tailored retirement map of you\nKnow it's called the retirement map for a reason it's our one page roadmap that overviews your entire retirement situation\nYou know sometimes people will say John that sounds too simple it's only one page no it's not too simple\nIn fact for many of you it'll be the first time you've ever sat down with an independent the only credential ... whose putting your needs first above selling a product so that you can get an understandable and clear breakdown of exactly\nWhere you stand and if you're wondering what the first step and that is just be one of the next five colors the call one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen now and again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen and a member of my team who standing by right now will schedule a ten minute phone call with one of our credential flu shares\nSo that you can discuss your needs you can outlined your goals will tell you how we think our process might be able to help you and you can decide whether you think it's a good fit to schedule another

you're listening to wherever you're listening thinks a lot\nFor making as a part of your day and on today's show were discussing before primary landmines that NPR progress as investors and it made me very different than some of the ones that you\nWould think at first thought would be true\nWe already covered procrastination and spending habits and if anything that we discussed raises questions in your mind maybe this is your first time listening to the show you just stumbled across it maybe you're someone who's listen to the show for months or even years but you've never taken a stop on a retirement map review or complementary one page roadmap\nThat gives you a second opinion an overview on your entire life savings if that's something that you think\nWould be valuable but I mean the

you've worked your lifetime to save of course I'm biased but I think it absolutely is and it all comes with no cost and no obligation again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine to schedule your one page\nRetirement map review call right now again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nIn the past couple of weeks on the podcast I've been discussing some of the land mines that trip us up in having financial success\nFirst of which was procrastination\nAnd last week I discuss how we're spending habits may impact or long term goals today we are going to discuss the\nThird landmine of the four most impactful hurdles and also accomplish in our goals and it's absolutely appropriate right now and it's very relevant because it's something that is being discussed\nOver and over in the news and that as inflation\nSince Nineteen twenty six inflation has averaged three percent per year\nAccording to the United States Department of labor and to put that in perspective our money must double every twenty three and a half years to keep a consistent standard of living consider how much money you spend each year on everything food clothes furniture children's needs transportation housing\nWhat ever that amount is what ever that monthly dollar amount is you're going to need to double that\nIn twenty three and a half years just to keep pace\nWith your current standard of living with the way you live life right now so imagine if you're fifty years old\nWhen you reach age Seventy three Seventy four you're going to need twice as much income just to live the same lifestyle that you are right now assuming that period represent a normal inflationary time period now let's look at this historically I mean think about it for a forty year old by the time you reach your mid eighties you're going to need\nFour times as much money as you have right now just to keep up with inflation just to live the same lifestyle that you are right now now how does this impact us as investors\nWill you must take action to grow your money to be sure that it can keep up and meet your needs so here's a little self assessment if you are not saving\nIf you are not receiving regular pay increases at work\nIf you don't have money invested in vehicles that will beat inflation will respond positively during inflationary time periods or if you are not earning regular adequate rates of return on your investments you are losing money\nIt's not just that you're not growing it as efficiently as you'd like do you are actually losing money\nNow in a low interest rate environment like we've seen since the financial collapse and two thousand and eight\nOftentimes savers or people that we referred to in our industry is safe money investors you know maybe a felt secure and the fact that\nThey weren't losing any money in bank accounts or short term interest bearing accounts but unfortunately\nThey're real rate of return relative to inflation has been absolutely negative\nI remember every twenty three and a half years on average you need to double your money just to create as much retirement income as you enjoyed in the past for the practical analogy I just wrote an article for the hill last month specifically on inflation\nSo let's look a practical example of this put a frog and boiling water and it will instinctively jump out put a frog in tepid water and slowly increase the heat to a boil and it will not perceive the danger an intern be cooked at\nLeast that's the premise for a late nineteenth century fable that serves as a metaphor for our inability an unwillingness to react or be aware of threats that arise gradually\nAnd that subtle threat regarding our money our president is none other than inflation so this is something not only is it a landmine that I write about my book", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "27"}
