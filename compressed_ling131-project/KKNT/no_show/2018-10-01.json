twentieth century is the ... century after the nineteenth gives you an idea\nHow long ago I began to show I began to happiness our it affects a lot of people and it's meant to\nAnd my basic thesis is we are morally obligated to act happy even if we don't feel it I mean every single instance you've lost a loved one model expect you to go bouncing around I'm not I'm not living in the twilight zone\nBut as a general statement that is the way it should be happy Mrs avert you there are people who think unhappiness as a virtue they get more attention why does it the squeaky wheel gets the

I Would like to devote this hour of the happiness power to the question\nOf can one be happy after trauma that's the question now\nI have not undergone trauma among the going very\nPainful episodes in my life but I came up I cannot claim any traumatic event I had a terrifying events of the Soviet Romanian border when I was smuggling out to\nDissidents materials from Soviet Union was midnight timid anyway that\nI in fact I was so terrifying for reasons I won't get into now that I got sick for about six weeks if it's very interesting I I very rarely get sick\nIt is\nA I think terror has an effect on your I'm sure it does have some effect on your immune system\nBut I've not been traumatized was never be male or a sexually abused or anything like that so some of you will have to respond\nAccordingly nevertheless\nI Will offer a few thoughts and then I Will ask you the question of the hour it's candy you\nResume or even increase happiness after a traumatic event\nMy immediate response is it am I think it's it is accurate it depends on the person some people are better equipped\nTo deal with a traumatic event than others but same thing can happen to to people and one marches on and on and sexually collapses forever\nI'm making zero judgment here zero this is the happiness our enough to judgments our and not even the morality our just want to make that clear\nBut for example uh one of the victim and she was a victim I uh\nI have absolutely no problem in state using that word it's wildly overused for that but that doesn't mean they are victims but this woman who was the one who brought Bill Cosby the trial\nWas a victim of his ... years ago when she was much younger obviously and claims that an altered her life permanently and\nI mean in his case again I mean the the allegations in this case charge that was found to be valid was that he would put in some sort of jogging their drink\nAnd then uh then use them sexually while ... or the ... while they were unconscious I'm is that is up the ... yeah okay so\nShe she says that this changed her life and\nI Am not making any judgment in my heart goes out to her I Believe that I Believe that that happened I Believe I Believe it happened to her and I believe that have changed her life\nI also know\nThat there are women who have been raped there are men who had been beaten up terribly I mean there are all sorts of terrible things that have happened and they have\nResilience to use the term that Dr warmer psychiatrist that I\nHave on the show periodically is it that's the that's the term in therapy or in the cycle therapeutic world resilience or to put it in even more for macular term\nShock absorber ... there are people who have better shock absorber is than others so the question is\nHow do you develop shock absorber is how do you develop Brazilians I think we can all agree that the ideal is not to let the trauma ruin your life\nIs it's one of the few things maybe all Americans can agree on is that is that a fair statement we we don't want you to be permanently crippled in this regard\nI always use or frequently use the Charles crowd hammer example it's hard for me to even see the lake Charles crowd hammer 'cause I knew him a and adored him and anyway the lake Charles crowd hammer\nWas in a diving accident in medical school and\nHis life was completely altered he was paralyzed largely from the the the the the shoulders doubt\nAnd he decided immediately I Am not going to let this determine my life I mean that's a pretty big trauma is that fair to say you're you're a strap few see pictures of him before the accident I mean this guy was a study\nAnd a hearing goes from ... credible athlete terrific physique to paralyzed not just paralyzed legs paralyzed I was\nWith him God it's so amazing because it's one of his last appearance as I imagine before he went to the hospitals with me out here in California\nFor ... university I think we should put the the video up I I ... I think people know him better and he's worth knowing\nSo ... I saw he was able if I'm not mistaken to to utilize somewhat warm arm I I think that that was the extent of his ability to to move from the neck down\nAnd you know he I have trouble breathing I mean it's amazing what he could complicate if you perfectly healthy it's amazing what he accomplished\nAnd God Bless you thank you so very much and I can cautious about thinking for saving my life Mr\n[noise] [noise]\nAh um chilled to the to the core\n\nI thought it was a joke and it was just throwing prescription so happy I took a\n...\nI I Know the power of the happiness or it's the first thing most people say to me\n\nThat it's it's changed their life they never thought it was a moral obligation that it's a brand new ideas to the vast majority of people or the you could decide to be happy\nThe painful thing of that coal and God Bless you sir and God Bless you for your service of course it's a painful thing is I Believe him about what therapist told him\n\nI I Am is upset about what the therapist told him as I Am elated by contribution to his wife ...

called American Atheists the biggest atheist organization invited me to their annual conference\nTo debate their head about golf existence which I which shouldn't have been a video\nBut in any event a ... I went and at one point I looked at the audience was about four five hundred I guess a atheist and I said so many of you ever doubt you're atheism\nYou know you you see a child born and you think whoa that's that's pretty amazing ... maybe there is a God not one hand went up then I said you know that's really interesting because every religious person I Know does periodically have doubts\nSo you guys have more certitude than we guys\nWe question ourselves more than you do\nSay were stunned because their self image is we all the questioners the religious or the except there's well you're wrong it's just not true we engage in far more self inquiry venue guys on the on the atheist that's my proof\nThat is my proof by the way needless to say when did they have their annual convention Easter Sunday\n[laughter] [laughter] oh\nBoy was in Minneapolis I remember it well by the way I just want to say to their credit they gave me my my speakers free upon arrival not every religious organization does that just for the record [laughter]\n\nSo I Try to be fair\nOr by the way in the news department news news alert should I bring the news at work so they have voted to take the Kavanaugh\nA boat

right because they know the sniffles ... like a dog sniffs\nWhatever it sniffs okay that's why you being played for as the fool you are\nYou thinking one week investigation with the FBI is going to have what they will vote for capital to the FBI comes up with nothing new\n... well the Democrats do all the stuff they will be satisfied but they will vote against him so there's oh he he believes they will vote for capital of the things though they'll walk knows they'll vote against yeah I think\nAlso he cares about their emotional satisfaction so that that's what he's working for your hobbies

days now back to back\nWhere two U.S senators\nWho have been sometimes frustrating when you're out of touch with the rest of the caucus\nHave been incredibly impressive Senator Lindsey Graham yesterday emerged as one of the most powerful examples of what's wrong with today's Democratic Party that I've ever heard in my life\nBecause what all the smoke clears and after Brett Kavanaugh presumably gets confirmed\nThe world will have to to to look at\nWhat the Democrats did to Christian ... Ford it'd be train her confidence and leaking her story in shooting on her explosive allegation for weeks and weeks hoping to derail Kavanaugh's confirmation in the eleventh hour\nAnd Senator Lindsey Graham it was if he had had enough and I don't know that I've ever seen a more angry\nMonologue gr soliloquy from United States senator does this cut number two here Senator Graham yesterday on the floor of the Senate unleashing\nHis Democratic colleagues and what they have put judge Brett Kavanaugh through what they put Christian ...

no one really take first I said a lot about this on my social media you know my Twitter I joined a score villa my Instagram at joy villa\nAnd I'm outraged first of all it's been a slow burn first it was you know you laugh at it but Dianne Feinstein she sat on this for what two weeks six weeks and weeks satisfy sticks a week and I'm the woman sat on this for thirty five years Dr Ford\nI don't believe she's credible at all I don't believe these allegations that poor man had been through so much as I Am a survivor of sexual assault I'll say that's on there I never said that on air well but I said because everyone says well if you have an experience that you don't know you have to believe women have to trust one of you I Am a survivor I'm an only child and as an adult\nAnd I remember every single detail or those horrific assault and it has nothing to do with oh yeah then my brain chemistry and she started ... went on a rant when I saw her testimony\nAnd people are saying she's credible I don't believe she's credible so I think she's broken I think something did happen to her but he does not Brett Kavanaugh had been standing with him and I will continue to\nStand by and I believe it's important and this is ironic from a man's perspective just to say if something did happen to her then then that has to be respected and that has to have acted and and what she's been through because of the Democrats is horrific joy yeah he wanted to be anonymous\nShe wanted to stop the nomination from happening right literally right but she didn't want to be identified\nThe in the circuit and they weren't sure and I that's what I first I thought this was broken woman she's speaking with that little girl planes she's tax revenues as he said to see a lot of faster at a university psychology and she hasn't dealt with her own issues\nAnd I understand that I have empathy for this woman she's broken she obviously been through trauma but now they're putting in her\nThrough the circus dragging her through the mud putting her on the forefront forcing her to spit out these things you can get some ...\nBut what the next couple of days or what history is going to judge this or we're going to see what happens what your gut tell you does he get confirmed\nGets confirmed when I saw Jeff Flake say yes a Senator Corker say yes Susan Collins I Believe she's a swing vote I'm

this through earlier and you here's why the hurry are actually has\nPopped up a story saying that Brett Kavanaugh is too big to fail now this is the administration the few that it's Brett Kavanaugh or ... they do not have a plan B there's lot someone they that there is not someone they're preparing to send in the game if for some reason Brett Kavanaugh should go down\nAnd fascinating a quote from a someone who's involved in this process who said that they're worried that any male nominee could have what they call the Kavanaugh problem\nAnd a source told Jonathan Swan dominate any man and you worry about an accusation that's thirty six years old how do you vet for that\n[noise] that that is in fact what I'm hearing but interestingly Mike I'm winning in my calls today to women because they are worried about their husbands sons and grand sons they're worried that McCarthyism in the short end McCarthyism is defined\nAs the taking of a terrible charge that is true in some contacts as against the Rosenbergs and has and applying it the innocent people as it was against the Hollywood blacklist\nAnd ruining their lives as a consequence here we have genuine me to her as a Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and a number of people in our business who had been outed as sexual predators\nBeing applied to Brett Kavanaugh with zero evidence one bit of testimony from Dr porn which the women that were calling this morning are not buying and they are furious\nI think I camping going below the water as we speak and Joe mansion in diving in and I'm sad\nTo say that I was so disappointed in Chris Coons who I think is one of the nicest people in Washington not standing up for the righteous outrage a judge cabinet are what are you hearing\nTo you that there's no question is emotional and I can tell you that there's a lot of women who are angry and even you feel violated and I can tell you that\nUh this is in addition to the point of view the you express but there's another one which is a this could be a problem for Republicans if\nIt looks rushed Republicans should have called for an FBI investigation earlier they should not\nLet it be perceived\nAs being extremely constrictors constructed and limited as it is being perceived they should have a real FBI investigation and then everybody would feel more confident in the result it would be better for Brett Kavanaugh it'd be better Supreme Court for short for sure for sure would be good for any Republican who's on the ballot\nYeah Mike I have to say that I think that's how it's being perceived inside the beltway in my ten phone calls this morning I have done more reporting of women outside of the beltway than every other talking head I have seen who have been repeating both left and right the pro cabin on contract Cavanaugh I'm actually\nTalking to women and they they can't get through a seminar callers we know how to do under this Nineteen years we know how to find first time caller tour outraged and the reporting is contract\nWith the blue bubbles and the newsrooms believe and I don't know how we break out of this one of the things that are mad about is one point of view has been wildly over represented in the media this week and I don't watch pocket because I I don't like confirmation bias I watch MSNBC and CNN\nAnd wild over representation of appetite cabinet sentiment is in fact fueling be outraged by people who think he's getting slime\n\nOh the only good news for him is that he's been a played by Matt Damon and you know as as permanent ...\nWell yeah but that also feeds into it I saw\nThat and I thought Matt Damon who are ... you don't have to agree with me on that too has contributed very little to the public good as far as I Know comes on and marks of good man it would be like mocking in the army McCarthy hearings chill Welsh Matt Damon should go and play Joe Welsh and the army McCarthy hearing and\nSay have you know decency and the mad sputtering venom filled spittle flex rage because that's the\nParallel and it is McCarthyism Mike and I think everyone who stands by at all it's a good man gets married who has a ten year old and a fourteen year old daughter and a wife and parents they are complicit\nIn this that's why I you can tell I'm furious I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh never spoken to him in my life but I'm a dad and I just cannot imagine this\nYou another piece of reporting we just popped up on ... years\nAnd this is related to the ... camera or us idea a\nSwan has picked up that we could well have a four four or for a while if for some reason the Kavanaugh's nomination does not work out and do you add to that that a Democratic Senate certainly is a more likely than it was about to go\nThere is no sentiment inside the White House for nominating somebody that Democrats would confirm Swann has started shooting a quote from a source with direct knowledge of the president's thinking who said if Kavanaugh doesn't make it and the Senate flips I think the court is for for for the next two years\nWell it's not going to put that and I don't doubt that that's true I I Believe that if if the Senate flipped\nI don't think they can from anyone but I Will tell you this ah the president when recess appointment someone who had nominated between then and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski I just don't believe they're going to be complicit in this I still think it's going to be fifty three forty seven because Joe mansion and Heidi Heitkamp will lose their\nSeats almost inevitably Joe Donnelly is going to lose any Bill Nelson is going to lose Josh all he's got a two point lead over a Claire McCaskill it's going to grow in Missouri also this morning\nI just think the Senate and the Democrats in the Senate or in the Bible and they really don't know what's going on out there these red states Mike Allen and I don't know if it don't you find that we haven't seen any polling\nIs going on\nOn Kavanaugh and which way the public is moving the only thing I saw I was in West Virginia where eight out of ten people believe cabinet should be confirmed\nIt what is your data point that makes you most optimistic about Republican\nJeff Flake saying that unless something new ... oh my data point is is a Josh Hawley being up on Claire McCaskill Kevin Cramer extending leader in North Dakota those are two plots that I get all those calling\nFor sure is true I can tell you the Republicans are most confident of that pick up with any of them\nYeah and and so those two alone make it impossible for Democrats to flip the set up but I think we're going to do better than that even though mansions added more see this is a this is an issue that throws not just Iraq into the pond but a hand grenade ended up\nOn and they don't get it\nThat they honestly they don't understand what they've done with this Mike let me let me finish with the U.S MCA the president\nHas renegotiated NAFTA nobody thought he could do that I didn't think he could do it I don't think it's going to be even notice because of the cabinet or a blow up but how significant is that he successfully renegotiated NAFTA\nThis is in question but when it was an expected it was on his terms it is a better deal for the U.S it's a win and nobody can say otherwise\nIt and that's exactly right and my gosh so much winning a gallon always a pleasure will be watching it\nBut I'm never going to get tired of it when I was tired of that I Am not going to get tired of wind\nGets Mike Allen good to talk to my friend actually I Am don't go anywhere I mean
