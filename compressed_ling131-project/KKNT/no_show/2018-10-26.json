with the current government\nBut the destabilizing Central America or not to stabilize this ... it draws risk in our relationship we thought that they you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship\nBut when you have this flow of migration coming across the border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't understand that but Central America allows people to flow freely from Honduras Nicaragua back and forth you know to a very a theory that Central America\nAnd it's so they can't

some of the nation movie dot com got them in the movie dot com\nA break from occurring and go to the past but it's really part of the current American situation you may recall the people who wanted to remove Andrew Jackson from a twenty dollar bill he's probably the most controversial low everybody now for the left is controversial to live before them\nSo that's not telling you much but we have a scholar on here professor of history and American studies in Hillsdale College Bradley ...\nJust written a new book which I Will be reading 'cause I I'm just finishing sliced sheer coincidence I mean in some very very very very very very very long book I'm Andrew Jackson\nAnd I'm real interested in the American president and general and so on Bradley ... professor of history book is in defense of Andrew Jackson\nAnd professor welcome to the dentist Prager show\nDennis Hi and thank you so much for having me on great on her\nThat's very kind of you to say I am honored so ... the the indictment of Andrew Jackson is I think largely over his treatment of American Indians is that fair to say\nYou know I think that's probably at least since the late Nineteen sixties that's been the great critic\nAnd of course that's kind of sneak into all kinds of culture and especially the textbooks that our children are reading so yeah that that's where it came from and generally the other thing that people will argue about but definitely the Indians problem is the main problem that comes up with him\nRight so what is your defense\nSo it's so there's no is no easy answer to this problem\nAndrew Jackson made his reputation aside from the war of Eighteen twelve in fighting a ... Indians and uh he adopted an Indian child now so I just am reviewing what we've said do you recall the point that you were making should move on\nYou know I actually think that that's what I Would love to jump right back in the court yes he was in of course I I understand ready to go to commercial but the point I wanted to make was that at that time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people really\nReally went after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water\nAnd the reason was because as president as he's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the Indian\nAnd for the resettlement west to a lot of people who talk wise Jackson spending money of white people so that people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral knew what we have the time it was a really complicated issue and chats and it was very worried\nWithout question he was worried that the whites and blacks would have very very high procreate at birth rate that they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them out populating them so removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures\nThat we used to be talking about the again the execution of it was horrible\nBut his intention I think was generally a good one\n[noise] that that's fascinating and that's one of the book is an important book value don't only defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I found so I think we all know and it's true that Jackson was incredibly violent man there's just no way around that in every way he was but he also had really certain rules\nSo that violence never ever could be applied to women or children that was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians and white deep respect strangely enough or beautiful enough yet it's strange interesting respect that women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost ... times and he treats again Indian women as well as black one white one very very well but the other thing I found about him so he's got his violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting\nBut I also found dancing counter so many current politicians the guy was just unbelievably honest in everything he did and I think it would it kill his soul she would have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest\nThat that's how much of a stickler he was about living out this deep deep profound on at the integrity it's really quite stunning\nHow did he get the I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound\nOh well somebody at a couple of quite a few good things in a number of tools that he had been a pre teen and the team and a Thirteen year old he thought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured\nJackson during imprisonment and mouth off to a British soldier but sort of the hill to this short can actually beat in Jackson skull or even until it would Jackson died um male could still weigh a finger in that ...\nAnd they wouldn't be actually even with the rest of the school that some deep it was [laughter] that's the kind of thing ... would never forget by any means but I'm sure you were thinking\nBy the way it would ... I I\nWe have very little time but I bought an older from you was such a scholar and folks you really should read this book I Can't wait to read this\nOr is it is it fair to say I'm totally different would be if it isn't he hated the British more than he hated Indians\nI don't think there's any question about that this is yeah you just didn't cross Andrew Jackson and because that soldier did that too and\nChat right never ... like the off you are a delight and are the folks the book is in\nDefense of Andrew Jackson scrupulously on us guys you can see the joy to speak to him\nAnd will do it again and go to a prayer for Hillsdale about ...\nAll right everybody I Am not back home at the studio so I Am not sitting on my sponsor the ex chair I give you my word I Wish I were if I'm so spoiled by it\nThat in the studio I'm broadcasting in Minneapolis it's not at the local station it's because I have to be in St Paul for meeting\nA where I'm sure their chairs are wonderful but I I periodically just keep standing well broadcasting\nOr you will get totally spoiled by the next three go to X cheer Dennis dot com use the promo co Dennis you get a hundred dollars off and a free foot rest plus thirty days you could send it back or I just want you to know but uh if you have your own office or you have employees\nBacks chair Dennis dot com I truly think you will think me ...

make sense why would I be offended for Christian to say to great is that's the greatest compliment I can get from a Christian is it's a great Christian commentary\nBut uh she the pastor's being was being very sensitive and to his great credit but there's also a function of our time\nAnd the Megan Kelly situation while obviously very very different he's related in my opinion we have become ... walkers on egg shells in our society\nIt is it is a wonderful thing I I have always try to walk around with why say anything that that offends this person and uh it's a monitor built into me\nBut every good things can go too far it's one thing not to gratuitously insults somebody and it's another to have to walk on eggshells with with members of every other group putting your own\n\n... it's it it makes for on natural relationships\n\nIf you can joke around and if you if you can't say what's on your mind\nIt's that's not that's not an achievement against racism or anti Semitism or other forms of bigotry tell them that cheap but\nIt's it's a form of\n\nHyper sensitivity bordering on nonsense and on on on natural ... if I Can't talk to you a member of a different group than me\nNaturally when I mean no malice and that's the frightening malice then it into the issue if you think I mean malice then don't listen\nThan I should be I should be extra painted from your wife and I don't mean identity anybody\n\nBut if there isn't malice intended then then what is the ... ... what is the hyper sensitivity it's it just means I Can't talk to you naturally\n\nAnd that's what that's what the left because it's it always means of cause you see it's gets it and they've got to be fighting some some new evil why they're micro aggressions because they acknowledge they still little real racism in society they have to make it up\nOh you didn't mean it but you really are are you really are racist\n\nSo all it does is make it harder to talk men to women women to man well especially men to women because ... you know you can insult mad\nMen are insulted constantly there on a daily basis men or\nMen or men or men or men are if you want to say women are then it's it's over\nYou were a hater you were a big if you're a massage therapist but you could say men are till till the cows come home\n\nSo we're we're breathing on natural this is not this is not a an advance in relations between different groups it's it's a deterioration\nThe issue we used to as I wrote in my column a couple of weeks ago that was\nThat a lot of people seem to enjoy than they should I spoke of my time at the Rotary Club and well how a New America was exceptional in my in my mid twenties when I joined assuming Valley California Rotary Club\n\nThat was the only Jew when the group and their their general reaction was so ... that's the way that's the beauty of flip the best reaction possible I wasn't put into some fine China where to be delicately\nDealt with it was just yes he's a Jew and therefore what he's just he's another American who happens to be a Jew great\nWho happens to be a black right what happens to be Native American great the weapons to be as panicked right that was the big aged right happens to be that's the ideal\n\nSo we we uh [noise]\nBecause whatever the left touches of poisons it's poisoning relations between groups that get along otherwise great blacks

that's the hamster and the only answer we have we got to be the the the we got to have a big boy pass on we can't Flay all around and and point fingers of blame the wrong time to do this because

myself when I made them is it thank you for speaking a thank you for speaking in a in a fashion that if I were there I Would have said the same thing\nLess than what they were kind of data Brett

for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little personal you cause ... for a long time and I respect you at all and you know that all the years that that I've been on the radio I said Senator Lindsey Graham is a good and decent man I met you in Washington DC early in my talk radio career you told me something that stuck with but you said\nMike I came to Washington not to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things across the finish line there's a belief and I and I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings are big because I respected admire you and I

they trade dot the Ford and there's no doubt in my mind something happened to the doctor for but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it\nOr they tried to rural and his family\nAnd they said
