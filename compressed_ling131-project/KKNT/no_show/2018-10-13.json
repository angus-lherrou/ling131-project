can all know that it\nCosts the board is going to take care of by ...\nAnd I love what I Love what you're saying because again part of what happens is part of the most one of the most dangerous things that the left does support on and you know this is they will take the text of the constitution which has been very clear meaning\nAnd they'll pull it and twisted and distorted moving with for instance to nothing in the constitution that would even whisper a suggestion\nThat you cannot bury people or cannot have a war memorial to people that have across\nOn it that is completely absurd I did there is nothing that mentions the terms separation of church and state that comes from a private letter that Thomas Jefferson sent an Eighteen oh for long after the constitution was written and he wasn't even there the constitutional convention\n... the idea that somehow the constitutional fathers would be uncomfortable\nAbout a symbols of religion being used to memorialize fallen\nHeroes how absurd appreciate your call sub par\nOr let's go quickly to a chase in Ogden, Utah chase you're on the Michael ... show\nHi Michael how are you I'm doing well\nOff from um I was just I heard earlier you were talking about political correctness and I'm\nA minority parties like uh eighty percent of what was it African Americans and Hispanics that didn't really like political correctness and I think the reason behind it is it the looting of what racism actually is\nLike you go back a during the revolutionary war period and stuff like that were racism was running rampant or being Lynch and you talk about it racism now where someone we something that's a little bit and appropriate and they say everything's races\nAmerican culture and politics is Michael and another\nGreat day in his greatest nation on God's green earth is a particularly great day if you want to use recent history\nTo understand what's happening in this country right now on the directions that we should go there are a lot of books that come over my desk\nThere is one book in particular that it just is a must read at this moment\nBecause it is so relevant to people who were concerned about\nThe prospect of a new democratic move for impeachment impeachment Brett Kavanaugh impeachment\nOf President Trump\nFor if you're concerned about what's happening with the Mueller investigation or if you're concerned about the Brett\nKavanaugh's confirmation there is extremely relevant material on all of that in contempt\nIs subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation the author is Ken Starr and a judge star I've I've got to tell you this book is so reasonable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are\nMost sensational unsatisfying and uh the the book is posted at our website of Michael Mann that dot com in writing it and then the response to the book which has been overwhelming since it's come out what surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that uh the Clinton a spin machine has remained silent\nAnd I said I said and and I'm going to be unkind but to the other content spin cycle is Howard Kurtz that at the Washington Post style but\nUh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and somewhat say highly effective\nAt a taking an issue with what seemed to me to be indisputable and that is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes from the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned impeachment\nThat's very high on the list because as you though a impeachment was extraordinarily controversial in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeachment now with some of the most of the surfers voices saying how dare you\nOn the book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off fun so very well in your book\nYes and uh you know turn the other cheek and kindness to to others and so forth but it's just the facts and and and and the facts are are a and sort of the day new mall was when we and the investigation seriously considered presenting an indictment\nOr to the federal grand jury and little walk\nNaming Hillary Rodham Clinton alone for her crimes in connection with the Little Rock or Arkansas face of the investigation in addition a during the course of interviews with her at the White House she stood in such\nComplete contrast in terms of relational skills and the like with her spouse Bill Clinton who of course is immensely\nCharming and charismatic and empathy at all the rest of it and she said as I say in the book seem to be just sort of deliberately in your face a A R massive\nA failure of recollection\nNot only strain credulity Michael wages to that by the time we assessed all of her answers we knew that she was a she was lying under oath painting a a failure recollection there was so colossal so profound that it simply could not have been true\nOkay you clearly believe a and I know because he said themselves where it would be a mistake to pursue for Democrats\nOr to pursue impeachment proceedings against a either a justice Kavanaugh who used to work with you or against President Trump or why why would that be such a destructive course for the country and and dad made you can relate that to some of the lessons in your book contempt\nYes Michael it goes back to the a structural protections built into the constitution\nTo prevent mob rule and we heard Senator Cornyn during the capital sharing so to speak about mob rule which seemed to be the disorder of the day and the dystopia that we all experience doesn't work stoned out\nBut the founding generation wanted a and demanded a super majority requirement in the Senate a simple majority of the house the people's house should put the issue into play\nAt their discretion so the majority can simply sent articles over but then there needs to be a bipartisan consensus\nDeaths the practical political message and the two thirds super majority requirement is embodied in our constitution so don't go there there's just no reason there's no justification other that to a further divide the country if\nThat's the goal bloodshed divide the country even even more let's do what the Russians were paying other owners amount of money and attention to to do and continue to do was just continue to sow discord\nA and rancor among the American people that would be the eventual a result\nAnd I experience that and obviously we learn from our experiences and while I was not advocating impeachment I'm simply putting the facts of the Clinton investigation\nBefore the house of representatives and while I thought it was a perfectly reasonable action by the house of representatives\nWants the articles arrived at even before that it was very clear that the American people through the United States Senate was just they were not willing to go so far as to upset an election over these clearly establish climbs\nNow if clearly establish crimes such as perjury and obstruction of justice and the like\nAre not sufficient to remove an individual from office\nThen there is absolutely nothing that we know that President Trump has done and leaving justice capital side\nFor the for the moment that he has done that rises to the level as I see it if it if each of the fence so I think it's a the the book and it's on the way is a cautionary tale be careful before you marched down the road peach run\nA new ad speaking with Ken Starr he is the author of contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation he\nHad been is pointed that special prosecutor and it was still special prosecutor in that special counsel and he's one of the most distinguished attorneys and jurists in legal thinkers in our country\nHe um had been appointed to the federal court of appeals by President Reagan he was solicitor general under President George Herbert Walker Bush\nHe also served as president of Baylor University and as a dean of the Pepperdine University law school the book contempt is posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com\nYou were talking before about the need for bipartisan consensus if any I drive for impeachment of anybody is going to be successful\nAnd are there did appear to be some attempt by both two senators and I I can name they were both Democrats at the time of the impeachment crisis I Know that a Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Dianne Feinstein a of um\nOf California I Believe had had both been involved with the idea of promoting censure or a resolution of censure and that could have passed the Congress don't you think\n[noise] yes I think a resolution of censure condemning the crowds of a crime a violation of basic principles increase on so the rule of law would have passed overwhelmingly non unanimously but\nA overwhelmingly I think it would have exceeded a two thirds majority of cars were given a principled an elegant way out\nYeah and and I'm a white wine was\n... who made the determination because it wasn't you who made the determination not to\nAccept a resolution of censure and then to go on with the people's business\nFor a number of arguments for advanced to the fact that the constitution contemplated impeachment against who was either impeachment\nOr nothing and as I reflected on the constitutional issue I respectfully disagree with that and therefore would say that in the conversation that may uh unfold and twenty ninth team\nThat are those who are crying impeachment impeachment if their grounds for condemning and I'm saying if their breath in grounds for condemning the president but it's it's a foregone conclusion that impeachment will not succeed and the the the ... the United states will\nComplete his term of office where we seek reelection et cetera et cetera\nThen a resolution of century strikes me is completely and the discretion of the Congress there's nothing so let me turn the tables on the argument there was nothing in the constitution structurally or text Troy that forbid or prohibit or the Senate\nHumor degeneration you lose your central vision receive a lion's Latin Right and center on airplanes I Can't actually face

midst of a\nPolitical year you think you may have heard that up to now and\nUh at meanwhile\nPeople talk about tax payer waste all the time we do on the show and it's a huge problem\nBut what about political waste\nOr there was a campaign that I I Believe more than any senatorial campaign now in history it's which raised more money\nAnd it's a campaign that's going to lose I Am very confident going to lose a deserves to lose if the campaign for ... or ... in Texas and the and Congress men is running against Ted Cruz ... and I just took a look at the polls\nThey all show Ted Cruz up up substantially up six points nine point seven points it's in that range\nBut debate or work just announced that he had raised thirty eight million dollars\nFor what\nI bet there are some people are listening to me you've contributed a debate or works campaign\nIf you've sent money to this guy called me and tell me why one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Syria is in a tape that he prepared Beto O'Rourke thanking his poor diluted followers\nI just wanted to commend unsafe thanks you with your whole we raise more than three million dollars over these last three months that came from eight hundred two thousand eight hundred in the recent unique\nContributions is going to give us the resources we need to lose his campaign as strong as we possibly can and it's more than three times the amount than Santa Cruz where he is\nAmerican culture and politics [noise] some going\nHand another great day and his greatest nation on God's green earth a great nation that is ready for a great movie [noise]\nSo we're always ready for a great movie a lot of people think that the all star is born movie that was released last week is pretty great [noise]\nWhat about first man [noise]\nStarring Ryan Gosling [noise]\nSome enthusiastic response and some people condemning the movie allegedly for not being appropriately patriotic [noise]\nI'll deal with both of those issues when we review first man coming up\nRight here on the med vet show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number\nBut first off there's some drama or at least melodrama going on right here on earth not on the moon involving some people from outer space who brought their children to Washington DC\nAnd in the midst of a the ongoing protests about Brett Kavanaugh yup that's still going on these are women who brought their children along I made the mistake for them of getting into the face of Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana\nAnd it sounded like this\nHundred sneaky sees apologize to my children for ruining their future is\nGive it to somebody makes [noise]\nI Know your parents or you\nKnow I mean I'm sure you know money makes no usually does\nAnd it was more of your money and he had been hoping [laughter]\n\n\n\nOK shame on you for not believing women and for ruining my daughter's life\nSome of them want to explain that how did a senator Cassidy\nYes he voted for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as did fifty of his colleagues well actually the vote was only recorded for a forty nine of his colleagues because one of them was offered his daughter's wedding but they had fifty one votes in the Senate\nTo confirm Brett Kavanaugh and it's a shame in a disgrace if they didn't have more but there wasn't um there was only one Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia who is willing to actually bucked his party and by the way I think by doing so Joe mansion probably has helped his own reelection chances enormously\nWhat what is this the idea of the\nCassie why are you destroying my children's future my daughters future\nJust does anyone have some sympathy with that point of view\nBecause I Want to explain it to me with the logic would be one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six there's another piece in the Washington Post and I've read it a couple of times and the first time I read I thought it must be a parody\nIf not parity in fact I I I'm thinking guest Jeremy we should have this this lady is a gift she sounds like a an old friend of the show foreign rain forest um but her real name is Victoria Bissell brown\nAnd she writes in the Washington Post under the headline a flood of rage is rushing through women's brains\nThat kind of a mixed metaphor I mean yeah real floods we just had Hurricane Florence but a flood of rage is rushing through women's brains why can't men organized to change themselves\nOkay she writes I yelled at my husband last night not pick up your socks yell this was real yelling this was thirty minutes of from the gut yelling sounds delightful triggered by a small fault was dismissive annoyed patronizing comments really small\nI blew hard and fast and the terrified me I Wonder what he said she never says the comment that he made was patronizing and root they'd been married fifty years by the way\nI'm Still terrified by what I felt and what I said I Am almost Seventy years old I'm a grandmother yet in that roiling moment screaming at my husband is if he represented every clueless mail on the planet and I represented every angry woman of two thousand Eighteen I announced that I hate on end and it was all men were dead\nIf one of my grandchildren and yelled something that ridiculous I'd have to stifle left\nMy husband of fifty years did not have to stifle\nAlas\nHe took a dead seriously he did not to offend just from park he did not to send men he sat hunched in her and he listened for a moment occurred to me to be grateful that I married to a man who will listen to a woman\nI'm I Am okay\nFirst of all can you imagine being a man and the circumstance and your wife is yelling at you because she's upset about the cabin on hearing and yelling and yelling for thirty minutes a one of the things I haven't talked to my wife Diane about this\nBut it it doesn't sound like that's the right response of your wife is yelling at you for thirty minutes straight\nOr for something that you said you know maybe you can apologize and started this upset you and me and well I'm going to go for a walk around the block good by a ... and there's it's not always the best thing\nTo simply sit and continue to be yelled at and sometimes it makes the yelling party even more ridiculous and then the storm\nSurge weld up and me as I realize the pathetic impotence of nice men's plans to rebuild the wreckage by listening to women as my rage rushed through the streets of my mind more mixed metaphor\nOr toppling every memory of every good thing my husband has ever done and there are scores of memories\nI said the meanest thing I've ever said to him don't you dare sit there and sympathetically promise to change don't say you will stop yourself before you blurt out some impatient annoyed controlling remark no I said you can't change your unable to change you don't have the skills and you don't want to do it\nYou I said or one of the good men you respect women you believe in women you like women you don't hit women or rape women or in any way abused women you will blooded and funded feminism for half a century or one of the good ones\nAnd yet you cannot change you can listen all you want but that will not create one iota of change ... what what kind of changes she wants she wants them to change genders\nAnd is that the only way he can make up for this whatever it was in the centuries of feminine movement washed up in a way good men of not once organized their own mass\nMovement to change themselves and their sons or to attack the mean spirited teasing punching thing that passes for male culture not once bastards don't listen to me listen to each other talk to each other or in your power for once\nThe gender war has broken out in this country and its flooding all our highs houses it's rising on the tour of memory that every woman has I see this nutty sense of grievance\n... if you're a woman and and you're feeling empowered by some of this rhetoric\nAnd give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six really\nShe\nUh she writes those memories will come loose from the attic in the basement where were stashed them I think the crazy on does some loose from the addict whether she's been stashed\nThey're floating all around us and there is no place left to store them out of sight not just memories of sexual abuse memories of being dismissed the stained his trusted memories of having to endure put downs of the office cat calls in the parking lot bark\nDaughters at a dinner party and for some reason the most chilling\nMemory of all little one Christine Blasey Ford called up and that we all recognized\nThe left her the laughter of men who\nWere bonding with each other by mocking us\n[laughter]\nWow [laughter] ah a mocking you a\nVictoria Bissell brown you want to come on the air and yell at me for a thirty minute\n\nFor testified under oath that the laughter is the sharpest memory of her high school will solve every woman within the sound of her voice could hear that laughter\nHad heard that laughter somewhere somehow okay no two cells don't laugh when you get home tonight\nNo man right now understands the flood that is rushing through women's brains again and only women and the deepest and I'll have evacuated their minds before the flood could reach them\nEvacuated their minds is another part of your body you evacuate usually when good men like such a senator Christopher Coons Democrat Delaware give heartfelt sincere speeches about how we must listen to women I don't know whether to coup or laugh or cry or yell\nMy late father was the experimental director for the Gemini program and I kind of grew up hearing stories about Neil Armstrong\nAnd by the way all the stories that I heard from my late father about Neil Armstrong\nComport with what you see on screen which is that a Ryan Gosling as outstanding a performing one of those classic American heroes are kind of world it could have been performed by Henry Fonda somebody who was heroic\nBut understated an unassuming with a quiet and mysterious deaths and in the film\nThey emphasize that part of the reason for that attitude\nWas Neil Armstrong's life at least according to this film in the book that it's based on\nRelated to a family tragedy which is very dramatically portrayed on screen at the beginning of the film every one is remarkable in this movie in terms of performance as clear foie I'm playing Neil Armstrong's life Jan\nA ... and she was a long suffering wife and she was somewhat skeptical of what he was doing she said she wanted to have a conventional life and instead here he is an astronaut risking his life constantly and that's one of the things that the film brings back\nA very dramatically I I live in Seattle as people know and we have a a museum of flight here and you can go there and you can see some of these old space capsules that they actually used from the sixties and you look at them and they're incredibly small\nAnd rickety in dangerous and you think did you really want to get into that things of this giant rocket can her only into space\nAnd yes people died in the space program and that's dramatized here two of the the scenes in which director Damien ... who previously did la la land with Ryan Gosling and before that did whiplash which also won an Oscar for J. case in men's well deserved\nAnd he does such a superb job I mean truly superb job of dramatizing the space flight itself the training and the Gemini flights from the dangerous flights that came before\nIt's um it's it's one of these films where you cannot take your eyes off the screen\nIt is so riveting and by the way Jason her which provides a film score that his heroic that his stirring that his captivating and very knowledgeable there's even a little bit of a nod to two thousand one space odyssey during one of the Gemini sequences where they're trying to hook up in space\nI'm the only reservation one can possibly have from the film is that it's not the kind of a real wake wow we've done it totally satisfying triumphant conclusion you expect is not the right stuff\nAnd uh ... what it shows also an emphasizes is it the space program had its elements of controversy you hear voices on screen about people who are questioning the value and the amount of money that we're spending on putting a man on the moon when we're going through very difficult times\nIn American urban neighborhoods but with all of that the caring about the characters including Jason Clarke Jason ... what a year for him he\nWas outstanding as Senator Ted Kennedy NFL about Chappaquiddick\nWere Chappaquiddick happened in virtually the same week as the moon mission with Neil Armstrong Jason Clarke plays astronaut at white who was one of the best friends of Neil Armstrong and he is outstanding to 'em it by the way one quick word\nThere's been some controversy that's been ginned up\nTo some extent by conservative media I'm afraid about why they didn't show the American flag on the moon they do\nAnd I don't know whether they put that in because the protests in controversy what they don't show is they don't show a big scene where Neil Armstrong comes down and plants the American flag and I claim this land in the name of president Richard Nixon no that doesn't happen\nHowever there are American flags everywhere in the ... you see an American flag being raised you see the American flag patch on the shoulders of the astronauts on their uniform uh there are I I saw the film with rock star Greg Tom on my producer and uh he counted fourteen ...\nAnd flag scenes so don't worry about that three and a half stars for a film that is rated PG Thirteen it's rated PG Thirteen for some very intense scenes of danger\nI imagine that most people who see this film are going to love it as I did and the uh it it is part of the succession you could have an entire sequence now\nOf movies about space program heroic movies remember Apollo Thirteen with Tom Hanks hidden figures a couple of years ago\nAnd uh and then of course the right stuff now first man\nOr it is a very major Oscar contender as la la land was we will be right back putting it in perspective\nDon't you go to\nTen years and the research and writing residents of war by renowned historian Michael Beschloss his rebutting intimate look at the president's who waged our wars presidents of war brings us into the room with America's leader as they make the most difficult decision basis any president\nWhether to

biography of Christopher Columbus is a very critical biography [noise] and\nI Am aware of what happened to indigenous peoples and in the western hemisphere as a result of Europeans coming [noise] so what was the choice my friends [noise] the vast\nMajority of those ... indigenous peoples Native Americans who were killed in a who died after the European arrived in North America the vast majority of smallpox simply had no immunity against the European disease\nAnd so you go to college you probably learned that the British tried to infect Indians there was the British\nAnd reading a biography of Andrew Jackson bills exactly would that one guy thought oh OK let's let's take a blanket\nFrom an infected the soldier and give it to her and blankets from infected so let's give it to me any ... that never materialized nothing happened\nAnd and that's not how you've transmitted anyway but that's that's what you'll hear about that they were they were deliberately infected with smallpox and how many year European Americans died of smallpox obviously not as many because there were certain immunity\nAnyway when I say well I was the choice I mean what was the choice should nobody could come here\n\nShould have just been left basically Baron you're not you think it was a it was a myth deficits to humanity that western civilization planted itself in the Americas\nAnyway I'm Dennis Prager and I welcome you to the show we have a oh yeah perfect that's right Steven Crowder uh gives the video of prayer you to be extremely popular\nVideo cast their podcast there it's called goodbye

moment that he didn't do what he did what he is alleged to have done in high school\nWas a match and he didn't do you feel sorry for him\nTo this is like this is a question like the one that I posed atheists when I Know I my dealing with someone with intellectual honesty I ask atheist do you hope you are right or will\n\nIt out if they feel says of course I Hope I'm wrong\nIf you think I I don't hope there's an afterlife you think I Hope this ultimate justice you think I don't hope his ultimate meaning you think I Hope I'm just a glitch in in a universe that could you know as much concern for me as adults for pebble on Jupiter of course I Hope is a God but I just have concluded that there isn't I respect that atheist\nBoth the atheist says I Hope I'm right\nI Hope there is nothing\nThere is a Bolivian for eternity okay that I have to say I don't find that person has taught through honestly likewise here\nIf you can't feel sorry on the assumption I making the assumption that he didn't do what he's alleged to have done in high school do you feel sorry for the man I Would say the vast majority of people on the left not liberals but on the left do not feel would not feel sorry for the man\nBecause there's a meanness that pervades left some\nIn fact what is it one didn't somebody tweet from the Stephen ... show or what was it again Oh yes at least we ruined his life\nThat's that's true that's ... Amos to ruin the lives of those they differ with\nThat makes them feel good\n\nYou know I might disdain for Hillary Clinton is analogous to the disdain of left this for ... capital let's say but I don't want to ruin her life I it doesn't even occur to me as a desire or a joy I have no desire to ruin her life\n\nOr I don't know I don't even know it doesn't it's not it's not the ... the way I
