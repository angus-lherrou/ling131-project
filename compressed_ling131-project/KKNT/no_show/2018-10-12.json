battle on campus and why it matters so campus battlefield the book is up with them as Prager dot com if anybody knows the campus battlefield is turning point you have people all over the country\nThat universities all over the country who were members of the pie USA I folks have spoken for his conventions are all around the country or will be in Newport Beach shouldn't in oh was it ... this weekend\nYeah and I was in Florida for you and you know I just want people to know I spoke ... was Washington DC 'cause I remember that the Donald Trump junior was with me a behind the seem fair and are you at twenty five hundred students didn't meal\nThat that's correct yeah you've talked or high school audience and you spoke to us from Palm Beach and in fact you also a book at our chapter he never be Wyoming or ... or ... people felt that was an excellent speech and I think a chapter at Colorado State\nUniversity is also hosting you know in the near future as well so uh\nI just want people to know how much we work together it's it's it's an awful thing and that's the reason I mentioned that but I just want people understand twenty five hundred students from around the country is it a cheap and that's a very big deal I I just want to salute you for that\nAnd it it when you go to something like that my dear listeners you you get some optimism\nShow you or your ... title of your book is how conservatives can win the battle on campus All right go ahead how can we say why don't we ...\nWell first of all the premise that I come forth in this book is the one that you talk about a lot which are what we believe we're in you know civil war and it's our culture war for the soul of this country\nAnd politics that Andrew Breitbart used to say first downstream culture and the most in court vertical and culture is our universities [noise] um they are they're filled with ...\nProfessor relief but you're always kind of like say Dennis ... not very much work that that goes on there and what what I found by touring the campus there in speaking at you know over a hundred a year and now having an organization that spans\nThirteen hundred of them across the country is that the fact that students are up her ... her but the fact is that they're not exposed to them at all the first place bravo and so I'm not quite what could I put together in this book or factually and it it said it in some ways it quite soon creeping ocean but we have to show up\nIt's remarkable to me how many students are searching for this message they had a desire to hear a different viewpoint and for whatever reason the universities have silence them and it's quite simple my conclusion I've come to is they hate the idea that there are other ideas\nFor why not liberal very liberal out there and more of a law\nThat they are focused on silencing any opinion that might ... model Rick Rick I'm\nControl over the intellectual an ideological um you point out that generation and so just just yesterday I spoke in South Florida we packed a room with eight hundred students day before that we have two thousand students at the University of Georgia\nWait a minute wait whoa that's a big deal it

girls but but that's very significant to forgive me I Want to underscore what you said very briefly\nThe issue my dear dear listeners is they have never heard our side it is not so much that they are from the left it is that they have no idea that there was a non molest way of approaching life\nExactly right and and what what I find that the work that pregnant university does and what we're doing on the ground is that when students are presented these arguments in a logical factor\nUm non feeling sense if you will because every ... rooted in the ocean and it's rooted in criminal um have you caught\nSo many millions of people than it is very few people care about how you feel we care about how you act and even more importantly\nWhat you think and ... ... ... what you do and so we have found is that students that have any sort of ambition students that have any sort of sense of human decency or wants to do something in their lives\nOn there's no way they can find a home in Iraq last\nBecause the left is all about tribal identity politics it is about\nYou can never you can never improve yourself you have to bring the external for any sort of suffering that you might being being experiencing short student that might have what some would say classical liberal ears are gay marriage or abortion they're leading the less\nIn record numbers because if they didn't believe him some step on Supreme enterprise or they think that black only dormitories are bad idea then all of a sudden they're considered to be a right wing or or service at the at the universities and so the second part that I highlight in this book\nIs how radical the universities have become\nAnd it important for your listeners to understand the Democrat Party the sixties and seventies that Jeff\nDemocrats those are considered to be fringe right wing radicals dial on college campuses if you believe that there are two genders you if you believe in free enterprise\nSystem if you believe America is the greatest country ever to exist those are considered fringe ideology and because of that you know the ... some way during us a favor it allows us to recruit decent minded students that\nQuite frankly say there's no way I Want to believe in this cultural Marxist group here that is being shut down my throat by my professors um and then the third point I make in the book which is really really important is how\nThe conservative business community has subsidize the students are getting over the last couple of decades\nUm it is amazing to me he goes you walk you walk the halls of Harvard or Yale or Princeton a majority of the big\nGifts that are given that the universities where the worst indoctrination occurs it's thanks to the giving of conservative successful business people that have allowed the Marxist to have unlimited amount of fun\nTo indoctrinate generation after generation and so it's really a call to action to parents and two alumni to stop giving money ... university not give it to ... university at the different things stopped getting money your actual school you went to first of all they don't need it\nSecond off they're going to use your money to go against your values to program a generation to hate America and that that really needs to be reinforced that I go through all this certain levels are given\nHow universities corrupt the or the ... process and how they perceive donors into thinking of going for the targeted\nOn initiative or program when in reality it goes for all the cultural studies or feminist studies and allow these professors to continue their on\n... ... ... ... book the book folks again as campus battlefield\nCharlie Kirk founder and president of turning point of usa the book is up but then it's pretty good outcome would you please tell my audience what has happened with the poll university\nYeah I mean DePaul University which is a private school in Chicago a Catholic school um has\nAllowed a turtle that that can to sell into myself are not allowed to happen next week despite the fact that we followed all their protocol odd that we feel about all the forms that they asked us to and and that they're not that they really\nAnd that's a common tactic it'll last for it to me there and working disagree with that candidate and Charlie Kirk\nAnyway I've always said I don't know how to raise kids with a bribery so the way it is\nDustin in Columbus ohio Dennis prayer Hi\nAnd thanks for taking my call Chris you everything you do show a voice in the ... ... ... everything that you're\nStarting to hear thank you\n[noise] um my comment is how is how conservative but when it every generation of conservative it'd be really good ... and\nThey were pretty extending ration generation of what the capital about the way I show how out later that I I'm Sorry I buy their\nWay of forgive me I'm trying to repeat your question how or conservative supposed to win if every generation this is what I missed if every generation of conservatives is what\nIt can hurt working theater ... are being left the conservatives are just people who share it but yeah but they have the last year that they disagree with that I ended up voting Republican any kind of working out big it'll\nAll go on ... every child extent the weapon that you know right when I was like on on that or I didn't you know\nWe're I think that there is only for all right so there are only two ways and that is to have to consider not sending your kid to a school and home schooling them\nOr is a two and two and to provide a positive alternative and that is through the great books through the Bible through prayer university videos me there is tremendous there was a tremendous amount of great stuff out there but the the first thing we're hearing aid\nRight within ... yes of course like I Do ... you know what their ... but at the Bible has been infiltrated [laughter]\nThat's that's the part of the reason I'm writing by my book which to my butter butter shock came in ... the number one national bestseller nonfiction number one number to an old book sold in America on Amazon when it came about may if\nThat doesn't show you were thirst for exactly what I'm trying to do are rational presentation in defense of the Bible and why it's the best book ever written nothing will\nNever imagined that it would be that successful the rational\nBut uh the the ... everything has been co-opted which is true he's right but we're we're fighting back that's why it's so important to the upcoming election it's why it's so important that you vote if the Democrats do in the house they're not expected to win the Senate but if they know when the house which you know the blue wave\nThat will be an enormous statement in this country they've tried everything the entire media has devoted two years\nTo undermining the Republican ascendancy the presidency forget Donald Trump please give me a break you think if if my parents were president they would be any different history of course not of course not\nThey don't want an alternative they don't they the the giving up of power is not the left doesn't give up power as if they're not used to it\nThat's why they went crazy on Capitol that conservative court for the first time I would say since since Nineteen sixty is a forty fifty eight years first time in fifty eight years the left doesn't control the court\nThis is this is intolerable\nNew York times when we come back I Want to read to you in New York Times headline and sub headline to give you an idea why the president
