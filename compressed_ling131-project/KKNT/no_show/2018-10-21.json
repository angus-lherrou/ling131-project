Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling cultural signaling cultural and economic shifts that are here to stay ... according to a major new report from the United nations\nForty percent of all births in the U.S now occur outside of wedlock\nThat is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy\n\nWould that means to put it in context is that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has gone up for a hundred percent\nWhy would that be\nThis report was issued by un FDA that is the United nations population fund it's the largest international provider of sexual in reproductive health services that says\nThe number is even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage\nThe eat eat you report says likely sees more birds out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare\nSo said the senior advisor in economics for the un FBI his name is Michael ... and in an interview he said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs in tax incentives given where parents support beyond\nWhat a partner can provide and\nIs he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock\nThat a good thing you think developmentally the government can do a better job than parents\nOr even the government can do a better job than some parents by providing these services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n[noise] look the problems with a single parent families are fairly obvious but\nOne of the things worth noting here with these numbers the reason that then I'm indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nAnd maybe a bit overstated is at least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but have decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it is unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married\nIt's not a small numbers at least twenty five percent at least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage ended up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection\nOf and it it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage by we what are the benefits of marriage was one of those things if you spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand immediately it's an extra pair of hands\nTo the extra pair of eyes it's a extra loved that can be provided to the child and if\nYou have one person who was also going to be responsible for trying to\nProvide an income well what happens to the child or two children\nAnd this is not to blame a single mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes with single mothers but it's very\nVery difficult and single fathers\nSame thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that there should be brought up as an ideal or isn't acceptable ideal\nI think it's very destructive and if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood of being involved in poverty criminality\nSelf destructive activities like opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with a child is increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household\n\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and somebody can say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the studying things in this from the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... since the decision that basically authorize gay marriage for every state in the union\nLess than one percent or have been the same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number and that's shockingly\nLow because a lot of people would assume do there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples that have been waiting to get married still less than one\nPercent the the highest rate for gay marriage and the country was built a shot San Francisco Seattle a second but even in San Francisco their dream about one point for nine percent of all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and in the e or predominantly to unmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says\nThe data suggests that societal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce have changed\nSince ... Jones the director for the center on the economics\nOf reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research is it a good thing is they've changed I I I don't believe that it is in other words it was it fairly common\nIn American Life to have what we are cold shutdown weddings where a couple\nActually concedes the baby before they're married not recommended but they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married so the baby as well come into a married home of course that's more desirable\nAnd and by getting married you were making a commitment to that child into each other\nJust someone down the idea that in most cases in of course I understand there are exceptions there are sometimes spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for a child but in most cases\nIt's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father let's go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio Andrew you're on the bed show\nThanks for taking my call you back on\nSo um for me um I have a wonderful thing and um I I think that parents have to be mentally president they have to be physically present\nThey have to be mentally president and whether you're a single parent or whether you're fortunate enough to have a spouse um you have\nTo be there for them and and unfortunately when it's just one person that has to carry the burden of being there physically and emotionally and spiritually um you can't do it all\nI guess especially if you're earning a living and\n... and look at its it's very difficult and this was not to say the preschool is important and doesn't rivers that are important alternative\nIt's just that ... you see if we have in this\nCountry such a a an inclination to not make value judgments event leads us to be blind to the fact that it is more desirable for each child to come into the world in a married household if we can establish that and agree on that then\nI think instead of trying to go back to the crash into society we should uh adapt to these new trends and I'm finding new ways of helping these kids ... and I just want to say it is you know back in you know maybe a hundred years ago\nUh you know that my challenge the richer so high that often a parent would die in the trial would or maybe you have to wait what their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives\nShow I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded to these translate\nWhat does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends but it sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI wouldn't say that we need government programs horse\nThat would help that would specifically be tailored to kids living in a single parent situation\nMarket white guy programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government day care centers\nI think that we're going to get care shortage will be one way I think mariners were you dip your people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay do I let me just mention something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous in very nice but you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nOr you know you're going to hate the fish but ah I I I'm going to ... where she cut their parents parenting because it's just\nIt's just not necessary and we should also leash characters on the rich\nOK well of course when he said I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on the interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the ended opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs in the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information a\nThere is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that that blew the lid off the welfare system and the way the welfare system as it have been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of\nWedlock birth and they're Democrats are written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan who was a moderate Democrat rose about the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are\nIn a governmental wars out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of that we'll be right back uh with when does a a public figure go over the line and

Congress people who were attacking cars and motorists\nIn Portland who we're broiling in the streets in New York City has his mom that fits\nBut sometimes there are people who get great respect in fact there's someone who has been a very close and an inspiration to a prominent candidate on the ballot\nOr three weeks from now Nineteen days from now\nI'm a talking about Keith Ellison the nominee for attorney general and Minnesota who's not only been accused very credibly of sexual assault by his former girlfriend\nAnd who has supporting evidence et cetera et cetera ... much\nWorse but Keith Ellison has also\nBeen affiliated and refused to repudiate Louis Farrakhan and uh\nUh tell me if if this sounds like somebody who is very much concerned about building bridges and are helping encourage understanding across racial and religious\nSaying something that is negatively racist then if somebody like Louis Farrakhan of saying it however I think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he'd received from David do\nBecause even though David Duke is a joke and a loser and a creep and a former klansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above\nA she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan\nBecause if you look at fire comes history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country the idea that he should be on stage as he was at a recent Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe\nIf he is a racist but you you simply can't all of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at this point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people and as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill deserves some kind of sanction go ahead yeah\nBye bye understand that Michael connected one more point do\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from\nWhere they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are you know very hatred of the mayor have full of of whites where it's coming from ... in a kind of a revolution are fighting back about what happened to them as a people over time\nWhereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever they wouldn't have packing people not because they did anything to them they made up conspiracy theories and made off that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also make knowledge of Iraq and\nSo the Armenian people were a cruel to the Turks and they were undermining the it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith and there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you want to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people should John

it's post totally legitimate to say that one of the tactics the Democrats have used in this campaign and its unique to this campaign\nIs basically dispatching mobs some of which we understand are affiliated with organizations that are well funded\nTo disrupt the Republican events to get into people's faces too I'm basically misbehave and contribute to this atmosphere of violence and confrontation\nJake says pretty sad to hear you get on the mom train I've never had much or any respect for you well thank you are but I thought you were above that\nWas anyone calling the Tea Party protestors in two thousand Thirteen a mom\nIt's a talking point Michael and you can't be above that nonsense if you partake in it okay\nHere's the challenge to up there and I'll take calls on it can you give me an example where any of the Tea Party sessions acted like a mom\nWhere they tried to shout someone down where they tried to disrupt something I mean when you're talking about mom to think about those code paying more ons\nWho continually continuing continually was literally several times in our disrupted the Kavanaugh hearings who flooded congressional offices one of the hallmarks of the Tea Party and I saw when my own eyes\nThese are people who clean up after themselves they wouldn't have giant rallies had a giant march on Washington one that was run by Glenn Beck I think they have two hundred thousand people there they had a ton of people\nAnd they made a very big point of asking people to pick up their litter and you can compare that to the inauguration crowd\nOr any inauguration crowd you cannot compare and the same way\nThat very very regularly or there would be people dispatched to conservative political rallies and he has this includes Trump rallies to try to disrupt than to shell out to be carried away\nAt it I won't say it never happens but it's very rarely happens with liberal candidate do you remember a time when when Hillary was forced to confront angry people chanting at her\nOr President Obama I I Do remember there were a couple of cases where President Obama had a heckler and he handled it very well and very classy and fine but it's so rare\nAnd uh again right now in this campaign you have major political figures like the if the Democrats take over the house of representatives Maxine Waters Los Angeles will be the chair of the house committee on financial services committee has to do with regular\nIn banks Maxine Waters is openly said that it is appropriate to act like a mom and to get into people's faces Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine show I'm\nTed Cruz and Heidi have been basically assaulted at dinner we played the other day or a segment of Ted Cruz being assaulted at the airport just the lack of decorum the mobster tactics that that's what\nWe're talking about and it is not equally distributed you cannot find current examples about that that are\nProminent on the conservative side of things\nLet's go to your calls to Jake in Philadelphia Jake you're on the ... that show disagreement day\nMichael I disagree with your you have a term anti Semitism it should be anti Judaism and heard of Jews and their religion [noise]\nWell no uh because of Hitler made a a very big point of killing people including people who were Jews would converted to Catholicism uh there there is a saint of the Catholic Church who was a former Jewish communist intellectual\nAloe what Hitler's friend was a semi mafia of Jerusalem\nOkay right I ... I understand but the term anti Semitism was originally coined in Europe in central direct a hold on hold on and it was coined by people to describe a hatred of Jews and you're right the Jews have been European for a long time\nBut this argument about a ... whether it'd all anti Judaism and as it is not\nA religious argument that goes down to religion\nIt does not go down to religion you know I I'm ... I'm Sorry sir they are\nFrom the church it started from a church Harvard\nOkay it it did not start from the church fathers had started long before that if you read about the book investor which dramatizes events in the ... century bc\nOr there was a very classic anti Semitism by Hayman who wanted to wipe out all the Jews and the notion that this is all about religion would not explained the fact that very secular Jews\nHave also been targeted by anti Semitism ... leaving the Jewish religion\nAnd taking the Jewish religion very ... seriously or did not protect people at all from the Holocaust or from the ravages of classic anti Semitism or to say it's anti Judaism I'm also would ignore the fact that\nGo and and again and you're you're getting medical and psychological attention and and that's good and I hope everything should continue to be better for you and then the the basic position that I Would have on marijuana\nIs is simply that being dependent on anything is not great\nOf I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading um they have a thing in the New York times I have a advice column called sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nAnd saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and they say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids said or the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month at lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them\nThey never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful\nBut the ideas look life life has all kinds of challenges and sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly with opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs or anything\nDon't make things more difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary\nLet's go to Lauren in Houston you're on the Michael ... that shows disagreement day\nHi Michael I'm neither the agreement today is that when the whole thing are Saudi Arabia why\nUm because it's carrying on hundreds of thousands of Yemeni people and bad and it's not a good influence for the United states towards other country in\n'em and because you already Capra diving my eyes and found okay what would what ... what if we were needy or eat it taking are and we're in an art leadership position in from other ...\nOkay Lauren and Lauren what do you think would happen if President Trump all of a sudden this announced okay okay uh we're canceling this arms deal with Saudi Arabia where they're buying a hundred billion dollars worth of our arms that we make here what what would happen do you think they would get their arms from somewhere else\nOr your ...\nAbsolutely they would they would probably get them from China or Russia and a ... again what have we accomplished ...

Senator Elizabeth Warren ... claim of having Native American heritage it's no different than you claiming to be Jewish\nOh really I'm not a U.S senator and I've never tried to claim any advantage to identifying as Jewish assist who I Am is the way I was raised he writes the name ... Eastern European that's true ... means bear in Russian\nAnd it's also means bear in check I Believe Hungarian a Serbian I Believe a bunch of Eastern European languages or I'm On the bear walks like a man\nNamed the vet he writes his Eastern European it is not Middle Eastern in origin well that's true but the most common choice names are Middle Eastern origin Goldberg which is a common Jewish name they were all taken a during the exile and again this is all pretty well known Jewish history\nUnless you believe the twelve tribes of Israel came from Europe no I don't according to my knowledge of the Old Testament Abraham the father of Jacob actually ever had was the father of eyes they give us a grandfather Jacob Abraham what was the father of Jacob who fathered twelve sons which became the twelve tribes of Israel that's right\nWhich upon entering the promised land God commanded them to commit ethnic genocide against the pagan is well no not exactly commanding them to kill men when children obese and burn while also burning down orchard et cetera a Holocaust by all measure as okay so what's the point\nI Would pay for you to take a DNA test Richard says no problem I'd also bet you a thousand dollars to the charity of your choice if you can show you have more than thirty percent Jewish DNA you know I might take this that\nI might take this bad for the record my grandfather who was an immigrant from Germany his mother I understand was from Poland grandfather told me his mother handed down to them is olive silver Menorah which I have a very good memory of seeing as a child during the holiday season it was always placed above his fire place\nThere weren't ever and Christmas trees and grandpa was house this Menorah there was handed down from his great great great grandfather to his mother does that make me Jewish\nAnd you're faithful listener Richard okay Richard ... it it does not make you Jewish because you weren't raised Jewish you've never affiliated Jewish you've never been part of the community the point about Elizabeth Warren that was so stupid\nWas that she never participated in any American indian life she was never registered with any tribe there was no tradition of Indian culture in her family\nI can assure you and I have three brothers who can help proven or even though my parents weren't devoutly religious when we're growing up they were extraordinarily committed to Jewish life\nOr my parents in fact when I was six months old took me to Israel for the first time and we do know because my mother's family had lived in ... Germany for many many years my uncle my great uncle Julius had actually traced back to the families lineage\nTo the fourteen hundreds and an old Jewish Jewish Jewish Jewish but you see this is this is not the point there are all kinds of convert to Judaism including members of my immediate family who have limited Jewish background some but limited Jewish background genetically or ethnically\nBut they choose to live as part of a Jewish community and specifically they choose to live religious late\nAnd this is really the problem with Elizabeth Warren is she was claiming to be a diversity hire at Harvard\nShe had put this in Harvard she had even contributed to a cookbook done by the Harvard Native American community called powwow chow\nAnd her whole identification with Native American identity was phony\nI can assure you if someone has been a synagogue president for Fifteen Years or in a prior life my involvement with ah with Jewish life and Judaism is pretty well documented ... by the way even though my grandmother was blond and blue eyes and obviously\nWas not a Middle Eastern origin\nI'm pretty sure that if I Do take one of those DNA tests and maybe I Will\nOr I can win that

to get quickly to some of the many disagreeing\nTweets that have come in on disagreement day here's one that\nCame in ah regarding this whole Elizabeth Warren matter which is obviously one of the\nBig issues of the week on this came in from Matt\nAnd Matt set in the ... was it was a response to a a tweet that I had my tweet said contemporary liberals this means you Elizabeth Warren\nDo have this in common with Nazis a sick obsession with one drop of blood or one strand of DNA defining something important about you even after six generations and then matched says man Michael you are way off base here and to be honest quite tone deaf\nI Know there are a great day in this greatest nation on God's green earth a great nation despite the tendency of nearly all politicians to say\nIf you vote for me and I get elected your problems are solved everything taken care of\nA there will suddenly be birds tweeting and the trees and flowers growing out of the dead and land and etcetera etcetera etcetera [noise]\nOne politician who gives you a different point of view\nWho says hey guess what we've got some problems that politics alone can fix\nIs the junior senator from Nebraska who I think has become by a large margin of advantage\nOr one of the most indispensable voices in the United States Senate his name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to\nMichael thank you for their ... and you're right about those words if I said anything like that a my BS meter would go off I wouldn't be able to pretend you can save the world by politics but my wife would just walk me upside the head\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because of a very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics didn't get us into this mess and politics isn't going to get us out what do you mean by that\n[noise] yeah so I'm sure we're gonna talk something today about politics and why does matter so I don't want to mislead than ever your audience and saying that it doesn't it surely does\nBut what we're going through right now even in the chaos and our topic really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways we're going to\nProduce more total goods and services around the world has ever known and all of human history partly because of this digital revolution but one of the things that it does\nIs it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have lots of social science literature now confirming what people have\nKnown for millennia um through philosophy and be allergy which is being rooted makes you happy do you have a family or do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation some projects with co workers in your community the local were screened community\nIf you have those things you tend to be happy that's about rudeness and yet our technology of letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this rootless age and so\nTraditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace at cetera nearing collapse into it trying to find meaning brand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can of emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with um Americans believing that you're either all on our side or you're on the other side and the other side is pure evil and our side as pure good\nThat kind of political talk flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal uh relationships in support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking\nI did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys\nAnd anti thought and and the two groups of of Todd's who seem to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another and they follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [laughter]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh if you're from antifa new beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... and he beat up somebody from antifa\nHow does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs are kind of lovable\nRight exactly and they could sing uh it it turns out that you know if you if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that I'd been great quick hit a takedown it's good to just sort of\nA pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agree with you but you don't persuade anybody that way and so when people use all these warm metaphor for politics I think it's sort of understands what we think any American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics may paint a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can thrive and flourish but things that matter are the communities of love and your neighborhood where you persuade people to join with you in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving those local community as well but\nLot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural uh tribes of affection and community and you know your your point about um about the loneliness a lion you used there are half\nAs many friends in America are in the last twenty seven years what does that mean social science data showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three point two friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half\nAs many thirty percent of Americans have either zero or only one ... in ... there was a loneliness ... out there and a whole bunch of people go to politics say at least I can figure out how to have a common enemy with somebody else and that will make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator or a Republican conservative Republican from Nebraska his book a new book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nUm let me try to make a case and you can bet it down if you choose a that that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nOr where you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing\nIs the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice Kavanaugh they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump\nThat we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness then we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat's going to go on and on and on so the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile and very destructive folks\n[noise] yeah so let me uh overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one tweak so the the overwhelming agreement is I'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaign and what people are so I absolutely want the Republican I Want us to not just\nAh expend extend on majority and the fact that I Want the Republicans do to win and the house\nUm but at the ... that I felt so say I'm the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred and the U.S side of that so if you look at anybody score card on\nThe most conservative senator I'm always on the top half dozen of everybody score card so I'm not in different uh on political matters and this is not an argument hey let's just all thing can buy off\nAnd how much the metal there's really nobody more conservative than I Am\nBut I think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might do something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if they retake the house\nStopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the healing that's going to satisfy people is\nIn a world where job duration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more a smart humans with brains are courting out ways to produce more goods and services are more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great\nBut it means average duration at a from I was born in Nineteen Seventy two average tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary bad weather\nToday at Fort Point two years and getting shorter one\nOf the things that means is you don't have relationships with your coworkers that last over the course of a lifetime and nails in particular aren't actually good at forming relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old and so we've got a lot more loneliness and their country politics can fix that problem rebuilding their neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book\nIs about fifty percent constructive about what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood I Do I\nDo I joined with a local civic organizations that me and I'm more likely to know the person who lives two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with being happy\nAnd uh that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post at our website at Michael med dot com or a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith\nAnd you do talk about um the the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country\nWhat's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues or have that that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\n... well said so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time I'm In the same way that deep friendship and stick a nuclear families and shared work are heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well\nThat we we know in the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family do you have a few friends do you think your work is meaningful and do you have a philosophical theological framework to make sense of death or suffering that drives happiness but one of the other things that happens in your local worshipping community is you're with people at an intergenerational context overtime\nAnd it turns out that I I've got two teenage daughters and the younger side as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nPolitical hits and there's a way to deal with this with the FBI edited the Senate's confidential process that doesn't start with everything as cable reality t._v. screaming and there were people in our Judiciary Committee who decided that's what they wanted to start\nThe tie that back to the theme of our half an hour to gather here I really do think there is a desperation\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics a forever war is what they want what they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids\nBecause they're not trying to solve long term problems they're trying to make politics for the center of the gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future a speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood groups ... couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when does it mean to you today a talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is nonpartisan and you and a camera on there's only one house in the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\n[noise] they do a ... there's a sense of printing constantly for the cameras and even though my state is one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that for the reasons I as one of the most conservative a senator or the United states molecular premier\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican legislature people did not officially ... really parties in our unit camera all our one one house a state legislature and so\nWhat people are mostly doing is wrestling term pragmatic question\nHow do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bell that's cost effective uh they're less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have slightly different priorities which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to be the bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by politics if if federal politics do what they should be an American constitutional hooked up with to maintain a framework for ordered liberty\nFor re idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights government is the author of sorts of right then government give you a small number of big bang\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back in communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up is not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of

Fox News prime time now he's got a big hit both on his hands right\nHe does and this is the first book he's written in teen years so I mean this is a pretty big deal I'm sure it's interesting that said about how America's ruined classes failed America and he kind of tells the story of Trump a little bit and when he saw and what a not a lot of other of our we saw understood\nIt just to give you a few examples you know he talks about how\nHow is it that an elite ruling class to think that giving people tax cuts would be considered problems or\nSaying that having to X chromosomes doesn't make you you know makes you a male and you should be allowed a woman's bathrobes and you're being told us not America First is globalism person citizenship citizenship for the world\nAnd so he goes to the story talking about not just ... but also a writer leader to wipe out a lot about American and does it end his charming and and funny way [laughter]\nAnd no bow ties anymore you know maybe they were ... and I said I'm going to have him on that might Gallagher show next week he's been traveling this week but he said he wants to do the show so I'm looking forward to the interviewing him about the book and of course rubber fifty years the conservative book club has been guiding book lovers of the best conservative books and authors of our time\nI'll have to go to conservative book club dot com

president\nTime you do it to me when you catch my program each weekday morning lives six AM and an east coast and on demand twenty four seven\nLearned more than ... dot com\nNovember midterms are scarcely more than two weeks away\nMail in ballots are already blowing in early voting underway Congress was in the crosshairs of the electorate will Democrats get power back in the house and what about the Senate to the gym actually gain seats two three four several current democratic seats are in the spotlight\nThose in North Dakota Indiana Florida but none more than Missouri is incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her very able challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project merit Josh\nThis time keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got some news biggest Claire McCaskill charged responded to our hidden camera the gay and she attacked a video of course she made a false statement in this state and she put out\nA she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II had brought you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh ... never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation\nAnd just to your listeners know our investigation McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that come up and all the cat's gonna bottles policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and the capital herself was calling hidden camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be gun ban some type so the capital now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only the Stanford talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talk about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into the actual vote with the so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there is a red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not left their their their their moderate\nTo pro life pro gun Democrats door thing in Missouri door Fannie swing state so whether it's an aspiration exposure is is that in order to get elected\nIn order to get elected you have to lie to people and that's what our staffers are saying he's saying the moderates we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because of the ball hitting\nUS Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling her a wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response James okay well it is some startling and Josh how I Would be part of ... in betting on me and my campaign\nNice to be attorney general of the famous Harry has to be going after fried not participating in it\nSo um there was nothing there have been very upfront about all my position I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment really telling about this is how how\nFar they're willing to go too far in bed somebody in my campaign\nWorld first of all it does I mean the whole thing fly categorically an unequivocal falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him and she didn't live on local TV in Missouri wary of what's going to happen next to this you know other than a candidate John ... and I tell you that had nothing to do with it\nChicken at response to that so I think were were cheating our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nHurricane and rabbits the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable and that does now passing already\nInto air force base near Panama City took a serious and it's one of the size of our leaders have twenty two fighter jets which they were concerned with our nation's fighting ability ought to be concerned about that I turn to a regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher a mouse armed services committees offense experts in the marine corps intelligence veteran\nHimself get right down to it the danger zone has receded according to I'm reading a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will heard Andy Barr Mike Bost Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory [noise]\nIt's it's we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and\nVery sound pretty optimistic it on hold outs ah Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... says we have around my district in northeast Wisconsin we've seen in a surge in volunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to pick up signs and ask what can I Do to help so I Do sense a slight\nMomentous shift I always thought this was going to be a nice ... when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other\n... but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and other Democrats are pulling out\nOf a couple of states that look if you try to get our direction so again we got to run through that you have this you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down\nThe candidate quality any sort of this twenty to thirty states that we're talking about here [laughter]\nSorry let me talk to you about some defense or she was first of all the F twenty to ten dull a it's a murky picture I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt at that but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe are doing to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way do we keep as twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell you try to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask\nHard questions of video deed figure out what exactly happened it seems like Seventeen twenty Jews are damaged I think ten of those are kept during the storm right at hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus mile per hour winds and seven of the seven Seventeen were lesser rated hangers\nI think it's important enough that no one thought this would be a fortified little working forty hours prior I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here on the planes are based in those so that they can access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a budget that twenty two is going into super cruise over Kansas is too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country as best I can tell him talking to officials pocket experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired\nBut the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material wham involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive\nAnd my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frames appear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track but we're Perry uh skins um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just say kind of your question you know why we're so many they're grounded\nThis goes back really to the Obama administration decisions on the program at two thousand nine factory gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on air force personnel and train maintain ours and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground in the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts\nAnd a lack of train people to repair that\nOur president is doing we're the John campaign when candidates in vulnerable critical house and Senate races in Ohio he took time to praise the work of some of America's political and military heroes who I Am from mistakes\nToo so what's the civil war journal Ulysses Grant proceeding by the mention of France number one opponent Joe Robert ...\nThree older shows now medium as users soundbites to paint Trump is a racist\nTrump is being criticized\nFor raising General Robert we\nSaid gave us a great president who has been properly recognized OK\nWilliam McKinley he has not put properly records\n[noise] general\nHe drank a little bit too much\nYou know what I'm Talking about [noise]\nSo Robert Daly it was a great general can you hear that he says so Robert de we one of the general\nStill Robert Daly was a great general change our debt [noise]\nAbraham Lincoln developed a phobia\nIncluding me Robert ... he was going crazy I don't know if you know the centers but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln jama reason I can hardly ... and one day\nIt was looking really mad and he just said you\nHardly knew his name and they don't take him he's got a drinking problem\nAnd I said I don't care what problems as you guys aren't women [noise]\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend of a crowd Brits what Solomon\nWho felt like he had the okay it from the crown prince who knew his rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nWill that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the ... the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday what are the second offends me six a sufficient to the United states\nWell the question here is has turkey shared its intelligence Turkish officials have leaked demand people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe radio of from inside the conflict showing who did what a mix that's an issue you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence got it buys who often work very closely with the Turks\nAnd that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared\nReally All right now does that impact for example the war in Yemen this is actually where I come home this is the anti Iran alliance ... Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront these you are sending rockets in Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome a as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nUh I'm not sure they had any impact on the Iranian odds I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish is whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a robot operator before the Saudis began to float that explanation themselves so I think that geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm your market Shelby has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long Democrat or a\nYeah I think they're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown princes with elite opinion you know the wall street and Silicon Valley a heated enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and there are no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nListen to the entire interview with New York times reporter David Kirkpatrick on channel reviewed income\nComing on last Monday I gotta costs of cancer that can be honest I don't understand they're going against him and I have to say that God\nThis invitation to counter terrorists by her alma mater from the tunnel review returns in a moment [noise]\n\n\nDo you have what it takes to be nine sixty the patriots Tom shot kind of find out nine sixty the Patriot in Scottsdale gun club resent the third annual shots shooting competition Sunday October ...\nCan be seen the top shot missiles theories tournament\nFrom best school we're down to a bracket silence finally someone is walking away with a one thousand dollar prize and the title of the top shot ... times shot and even accuracy shooting bowling pin this competitive but mine competition has something for everyone\nFrom experience tutors to nominate all of us will receive a top Johnny ... bags as well as loans gifts for shooters here's your chance in one thousand dollars of\nFree Scottsdale gun club membership and more signed up today at nine sixty the patriots dot com for Tom shot Sunday October ... competition details and\nRegistration at nine sixty though patriot dot com sponsored by more injury law\nTripled\nOn food truck reminds everyone listening while ... may not be mindful of traffic ... we just finished she learned for children across school you're unemployed areas remember it's up to the motors make sure junior scene and never raunchy might triple not try this food truck menu uses not concepts just good foods for more information call\nFor you know to Nineteen eighty three forty eight that strip all the food truck hoping you'll be you're probably driving safely in watching out for the kids ...\nSpecialist reminds everyone listening if you are so many you know too much to drink the super ... remembers you not only your own life you may be saving but also the lives of others so please\nNever drink and drive Greg ... thirty eight or Ninety jama knew in Phoenix and full service on a repair garages supplies quality work ... for information ... two two four six twenty eight eighty one or visit online\nGrant Clark auto dot com best Greg and his staff of Greg Clark dot com hoping you'll do your part by always driving safely\nAmusing is a bridge between the material and spiritual [noise]\nMy name is Harvey lower and I'm eighty two\nIs a blind person you have to be aware that nobody can tell you what you can or can't do you really have to try\nMy vote got me a little radio in Nineteen forty and\nThat was the best Christmas present ever got was eleven years old is when I started to play music\nAnd then the accordion and then the show\nMy wife who is also blind was a good cook when she died when I started meals on wheels\nLet's do lunch\nOne of ... million more leaving I raised him drop on the hot and you can allow\nVolunteers from your meal ... and ... on the lines are drawn to you by ...
