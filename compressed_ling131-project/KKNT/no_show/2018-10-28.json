about the um the journalist where we are there's more to that and we really it's a start our country not our battle anywhere you are called to talk about the uh the planned that invasion\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion yes\nSir well a Ito given the fact that we've had so far this year\nI think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across\nAnd ah this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system\nIs basically an attempt to raise the border and say that um we have to let in anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that a lot of them say that so [noise] but when you say ... and a planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUm I think it's just a part of the the war or the battle between conservatives and left or center trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of course they play a lot\nOf very close compassionate a video showing some of these poor people who I think are hungry\nOr scared I'm hopeful ah they they do not appear\nTo be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and to say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras is to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now [noise]\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras a more livable place because that's really going to be the only kind of answer that has a long term impact or let's go to

really not our crime it locked the guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it\nFor sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country installed\nOn because we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument is we ah we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia now of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world\nBut it's a country that we sell a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal and if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nA China or Russia and I\nMean why does that have to do what does have to do with this guy can kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow um Mohammed men Solomon the prince crown prince and Saudi Arabia [noise] ...\nThe idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press and I think he ... obviously President Trump has never called on anyone to kill reporters\nAre and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference than it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte in one of the worst moments of his life\nLosing his temper and slam slamming

I\nJust wanted to ask you they at the outset eat your piece was actually scary and sad and very honest\nAnd how how many years\nDid you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem lives I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it so a long time\nHow do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm sober I can look back on some of the uh who might be have years when I was high and realize that uh that pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having\nA public meltdown even temper tantrums even uh getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also\nWasn't sleeping normally I I was I was kind of ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time\nThinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume at about the consumers with about trips I could take that were revolver on marijuana and you know it just kind of became the center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you uh you been married for a while right\nHas been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still and you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I mean I published a capitalist ten bucks I had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for\nYou know pretty much every English language publication except for the New Yorker you know I'd say that it's not like I [noise] I was a um an on ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I certainly would have a you know live my life but more integrity and and carried out my ah my business ferrets with well maybe more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nHow long how long have you been sober a\nMy one year anniversary is November eleventh so I'm going to make it I'm pretty sure that uh relapses incoming before that so I'll just say a year\nOkay well good for you congratulations on that and what advantages do you see now that your non smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of or go to want to buy because in some ways\nMarijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote almost all my books by all the time and I ... although in retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting hot\nAnd I I think there'd be fewer of those but you know I it it it helped me come up with certain flights fancy indecent jokes\nUm and it was a creative stimulant in some ways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends um I'm Better organized um I I I Can't say I'm making more money but I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't there is out as much chaos and ... and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat it's happening when I was using marijuana you know I'm not I'm not super up all the time or and and then when I when I bought 'em out I don't bottom out if there was no there's no high or low it was like I said\nSo I'm not having those melt down that would characterize a sort of my he's my addiction cycle\nOne eight or nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... speaking with Neal Pollack who wrote about how marijuana almost ruined his life yeah one thing you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years\nDid your wife ever share a year and ... them for a lead\nNo and in fact you know she was the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all um and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I Would just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive it in some ways\nIt's considered a health food um and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and my family um and obviously had the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me\nUm maybe I should add you know if I was stuck in behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym so he you know pick a hit so like it'd be high wall of working out here that's not the signs of someone who is\nNecessarily healthy but uh you know I just\nI ah I didn't see it she did and she she was so grateful when I finally made the decision to quit\nYou know I ... you use the figures in your in your piece and I I I think they're generally accepted figure there from the journal of the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggested to some nine percent of people\nWho ever use marijuana end up getting addicted\nAnd Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers did you first use a weight as a teenager\nYeah I smoked once at a party when I was in high school but you know when I was when I was a teenager let's just you know the Nineteen eighties I was I was sort of a a\nGo getter do gooder student council type sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on you know Michael J. Fox is character from Family Guy that was my model like I was going ... I Would be successful I was going to be as great American\nCitizens and um and so part didn't really play into it um you know in college I kind of um\nI I went a little uh [noise] I I I I'm a member of generation X. and so you know I I became kind of a a a grouchy pop culture sitting at but I still wasn't doing a lot of drugs or it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I um that I really started a consuming it\nSo it was an adult onset addiction\nRight right and I had a view I'm ever tried to calculate how much money you invested in and buying lean over the years so\nOh I mean it was probably a few thousand dollars you know that the thing is it and you know I had missed this isn't a brag it's just a fact you know I there was a time there where I was a ... you know well known writer and people would just give me drugs\nUh or or smoke me up and I I'm I'm I'm kind of some\nInherently cheap so I Would look for situations where I ... I knew I'd be around people who would have it\nSo I wouldn't have to buy but of course I still would sometimes you don't have lifted LA I had a medical marijuana card out here I go to Colorado for a week and I've spent a hundred two hundred bucks so it didn't bankrupt me in that sense but\nIt you know it still it was still even on a month where it was really good at ... still caught me at least fifty dollars about a hundred bucks and I\nKnow you you you've written a since you've written is the sentence obviously causing a great stir have you done some negative reaction from a seven year old friends\nOh no people have been very supportive I got a few people who wonderful go\nYeah yeah I mean generally when someone announces that they're an addict the reaction is that like you're making it or [laughter] you know you're ... you know or or you're not an addict I mean if you if you go through what if you go through the twelve step program guided you there's no way you\nCan anyone can say that you're not an addict I mean I wouldn't have done it if I was at but ah you know there was some sort of anonymous\nEmails and comments on line that said that there was no way without describing could possibly be true but I was fictionalized but that was somehow working with reactionary forces who want to continue can contribute to the drug war but those those comments were wider five percent most\nPeople because you you make it you make it very clear in your in your column that you believe that marijuana\nSuffer from addiction would would disagree with that\nLet's go to Steve in Louisville, Kentucky Steve you're on the show was Neal Pollack\nMichael thanks for having me on so new and just listening to talk it seems like we live a very weird life just just to different places [noise] um I kinda wonder how many people are out there like us I'm certainly the years\nOf consumption of marijuana or I can talk to the um you know ... has it affected you know you mentioned it seemed like you were a little conflicted [noise]\nHas to in order to help your life for ...\nFor me you know I didn't have or avoid that I was trying to fill fill a marijuana we just kind of stumbled across to each other but certainly the creative aspect that may be a little bit more on the artistic side of the visual side\n[noise] I feel that it's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question was what\nThe show was glut primary made you quit\nYeah that that's a good question and to address the thing you were saying it's like it just marijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm\nYou know heroin or where your job if you get addicted very fast I'm Philly you can use it for a number of years it's sort of a low level and it's gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity came echo ironically enough\nNow that the Dodgers are back in the world series actually came at the world series I ... I went to Los Angeles because I'd always dreamed of going to a World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it and I bought a ticket off about some project and third party Web site before I did that\nI managed to get as high as I possibly could\nUm even though you know there's no reason why you need to get hired and go to the world series but I needed to get hired to do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high\nUm smoking the huge joined it had all this crystallized THC up all over the night from smoking weed with a stranger and in his house an echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally I started screaming at people and I was I got arrested I got it scored it\nOut of the stadium or by security guards I was in the parking lot sobbing and I just kind of took a look at myself in the ... side view mirror of a car and I just saw this you know old man with red rimmed eyes\nCrying over a baseball game and I just I thought to myself this isn't good I Can't go on like that and so I didn't quit that day but three weeks later I I you know it's kinda sunk in and I just I took my last puff and\nKen Daniel more around having both can can you be around other people who were getting I uh use our would you go into the other room\n[noise] no I Can't I was at a music festival in ...

data suggest enthusiasm among early GOP voters that could put a dent in democratic hopes for a blue wave in the midterms\nIs a blue wave turning purple Republican affiliated voters have out pays democratic affiliated voters in early voting and seven closely watched states\nAccording to data provided by target smart and independently analyzed by the NBC News data analytics slab GOP affiliated voters have surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona key Senate race Florida\nKeys Senate race and governor's race Georgia key governor's race Indiana key Senate race Montana key Senate race Tennessee in Texas the data show only in Nevada\nHave democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voters so far in early voting according to the data this is um [noise] this is pretty dramatic now look every one of those states except for Nevada\n... is a Republican say there's the state to the Trump carry some of them may carry it out and buy a lot however he didn't necessarily do it with early voting\nBut when you're talking about Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee in Texas [noise] those are all states that Trump carried and uh however\nHe did these candidates in those states so new to do better than Trump they just need to do as well and uh this would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage in the generic poll [noise] the reason is that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would\nIt's the same reason it didn't matter ultimately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes\nBut you know what that was all in California and that's the point one of the reasons I think that Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot there are thirty six seats where there is no Republican candidate\nReally where it's just so like I I don't think Maxine Waters has a Republican candidate against are there other seeds that are so dominated by the Democratic machine no Republican runs you know how many seats there are no\nDemocratic candidates only three [noise] so when you

disillusioned how often can you cry wolf about that stuff\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number a President Obama's successor was also speaking today and he had a a different tone he was speaking outside the White House and here's a President Trump said\nPutting in a resolution [noise]\nSometime this week a week and a half we\nHave been\nSet for doing this out for the middle of the fact that we've already [laughter]\nI Know you look at that time there was a vote that you're like\nOkay uh I'm not sure this is going to work\nAnd what he's talking about is I'm trying to do a ten percent middle class income tax cut sounds pretty good\nBut honestly I don't I don't think he will get the support he needs unless a and first of all these right to say we're we're going to try to do the vote after the election when he's talking about now is a proposal to try to excite the Republican base and of course people should be excited about it you know how much money you spend in taxes\nAnd getting ten percent of that bag that's pretty cool that's a nice thing however\nHe can't do it honestly unless he finds some kind of compensating a place for money to come in because it\nIt simply does not work it does not work that when you cut the tax rate that automatically the revenues go up I mean it's true that the revenues didn't go\nDown from the last tax hike but because we're spending so much more than ... continue to grow up we're already looking at a trillion dollar a year deficit\nAnd I think the president should a work as hard as they can maybe after the election with a Republican House and a Republican Senate to try to yes continue to cut taxes\nBut to do so by cutting spending one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or in Nevada a President Trump spoke on Saturday and he was talking so much similar terms listen\nWe're looking for in a major factor for Middle East [noise]\nAnd we knew that it will be some prior I Wish they had are setting the right now around the block a major for young people not at all and he's working on it [noise] All right we're we're all working\nAt a major tax cuts for\nI wouldn't say some time around the first or maybe a little bit more that\nOkay one of the things that we need to keep in mind is they're already was a tax cut for middle income people you may not be aware of it but you will when you fill out your tax forms and everything because basically the exemption\nWas doubled in other words part of what we have now is that the standard deduction the standard deduction that people receive\nWas doubled which means that there's an extra twelve thousand dollars that people who are middle\nTaxpayers are not paying taxes on\nThat's the thing and that should save a lot of money all ready for middle income people\nAnd uh I I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump did something that provoked a huge Lee negative response on CNN [noise] what's striking about this is not the light it sheds because she has no light at all on President Trump's proposed actions concerning the federal government\nAnd trans gender is um\nWhat's shocking about it as a supposedly journalism and honestly these reporters on\nAre are are are sounding completely an unapologetically partisan I'm Talking about John\nBerman and um and I'll Alice in Colorado and John Avalon\nOn uh CNN listen to how they react\nRemember it was just over three years ago that same sex marriage became legal in this country\nSo now the wedge issue has moved to trans rights and concern so I'd love to mock the issue of identity gender identity civilized by Facebook's dozens of gender options\nI'm also liberal abrasive myriad of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect\nRepublicans water benefit from this backlash and it's an easy target just look at the numbers transgender folks make up an estimated zero point four percent of American adults work more than ... million people\nThat's still a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than the millions of gay and lesbian Americans who most people now know was friends family and co workers\nAnd there's just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination was a pretty basic American values\nRooted in freedom and equality not President Trump has also been playing up the caravan of asylum seekers from Central America pushing it as a threat at rallies in tweets and with plenty of amplification from conservative media this is just more play the bass panic rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the border\nOkay there is let's say they don't rush the border what are they coming here to do they're they're coming here\nIn Moscow to get into the United states and what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum and basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a bad basically the core of our sovereignty\nGets to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't\nWe don't get to decide because we're not East Germany who leaves the\nCountry and people are free to leave but\nThis is this is bizarre this is um and we have that can we go to this last\nAh [noise] ah we don't have time okay ah I ah\nI Know we will be speaking about this later frankly what President Trump is doing is not taking away anyone's rice what he's doing is taking away a federal government position I actually believe that the federal government's position on transgender ism should be neutral\nAnd in other words don't\nPersecuted people were transgendered but don't\nSo people ask for what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look you're a writer and insurance premiums because I'll forget it that's what they came to the boat that locked in Obamacare are in New Hampshire in ... in New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting and have what's called the intent to reside law\nSo and I write about this in the book that the Democrats ... New Hampshire\nThe gardener even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of try to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire the senator from New Hampshire Kelly ... she ended up losing by one thousand votes\nIn twenty sixteen well they had six thousand people registered to vote on the same day in New Hampshire and they had these buses that come in from Massachusetts the neighboring state six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or pick the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire residents\nSo those are a couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think\nThat document example you've gotten mayor's races you got sheriff traces of the sheriff's rate\nIn Florida that uh it's basically been proven to that they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the election basically been certified or the to the judge has ruled that well we have to give these fellows due process though that's not enough evidence for invalidate though\nIt happened a nationally\nDon't change would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because I think it really get down to the blowout in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida and I've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the the reality is the bias is\nTo let people vote right I mean no one wants to the press illegal voter but\nBecause of that it's created a system of vulnerability but I think are actively exploited by bad actors so I mean the the Texas Democrat and mailing the the voter registration form is one example but you know you got groups\nLike acorn and low raw data and their whole job is to go out and Raul stop as many voters as possible regardless\nOf the legality of those voters right you've got\nVoted I should I Know one ...\nOne of the same way one of the things or one of the things that people seem to be a interested in on the left as the idea that\nIf you're a college student you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice now that's a legal but that happens a lot doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean there are nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country or the Supreme Court sided views that are specific that says twenty four million voter registrations this country are completely wrong so that's one in eight by the way\nThat we know we've got massive problem and then the question is how easily are they exploited\nA K they show you have to rush in that we're going to face in just a moment with Eric Eric eggers whose new book fraud how the left plans to seal the next election it's posted up at our website\nQuestion that we're going to ponder is what do you do about it how can it be fixed how can we be protected we'll get to that and more with Eric eggers his new book is called fraud\nHow the lesson plans to steal the next election will be right back on the ... that show\nMichael ...

doctor taxing options for people succeed by you know [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nReally does my message\nOn the show I'm speaking with Eric angers he is the author of a fraud how the left plans to steal the next election and fraud appears with say an introduction which is excellent by Peter Schweitzer who works with Eric eggers on a previous number one best selling book\nCalled Clinton Cash it's really\nAbove said the change the world and at least change the direction the campaign or Eric ... before the break we were talking about some of the numbers in your book twenty four million just wrong registrations among people around the country\nIt's incredibly easy to uh to commit voter fraud if people are motivated to do it so what do we do to make our elections more secure\nIt's a great question and it's one that states around the country have grappled with\nTimes so um we saw how close the election with a joystick in Ohio and you mentioned that at the outset so it's important to note that Ohio is done I think basically followed a template that other states would be wise to do it they\nAre taking steps to start removing would be illegal voters from the voter rolls and uh they required an ID I also think by the way it's instructive and this is part of why the subtitle is how the left acquaintances deal the next election because they talk about how\nGeorge Soros and Tom parade as his head of the Democratic party essentially fund efforts to both keep the voter rolls inaccurate and therefore elections insecure and then on all in fun groups like acorn other objects and exploit those vulnerability\nBut the state of Ohio had to fight source of effort to do both those things right it was a Supreme Court decision was five to four but allow them to continue to make sure that the people on the voter rolls were legal voters and then to be able to implement ID so those are those are cute commonsense\nSee this is a very very important thing to keep in mind because when you think about cases like this a lot of people think well it's a matter of there's a conflict between two people and the government is sort of leaning on one side\nIs not a conflict between two private citizens which a conflict between a private citizen\nAnd an interfering bullying intruding government in this case the state attorney general\nAnd thank goodness alliance defending freedom has won a lot of these skirmishes and they're going to continue to do so the barrel ... case has not been settled yet\nBut you can be part of it the part of this cause and right now alliance defending

issue facing the country right now is um the what happened and they\nAre in Turkey in Istanbul at the Saudi council it or where cuts Yogi was apparently murdered\nAnd mark ... from New York Times Mr Trump's already acceptance the Saudi explanation that Mr ... was killed accidentally and a fistfight rather than an orchestrated hit order by the Saudi royal court suggests how he plans to ride out the most acute foreign\nPolicy crisis of his presidency what this is the most acute foreign policy crisis of his presidency\nWhy is it a crisis why is it suddenly news that the Saudi regime his saga and difficult and problematic and by the way President Trump has not said he said the opposite he's not said that he owed just except for the Saudis tell him without questioning\nWith the midterm elections less than three weeks away and a political base more focus on jobs in the confirmation of justice Brett I'm capital why why people more focused on that because that stuff really matters\nAnd you can say well this matter to ... but honest to goodness this is just an indication this outrageous piece\nThat what the Democrats really want\nIs they want to use this as a cudgel it's convenient cubs all they want to pick this thing up and use it politically as if Trump did something wrong from was and they say oh it's Trump's hatred for the press that enabled this\nThat's the ... and it's ridiculous I I honestly think that most Americans including Democrats purchase smart fall for this I Do not understand how anyone can suggest this is a political issue we'll be right back on the

sixteen days to go before a very exciting [noise] very very close congressional election coming up and gubernatorial elections I mean this is a big big deal and right now\nIt turns out that right before this particular election of President Trump's approval rating according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News poll\nAs being heavily covered on CNN\nAnd everywhere in mainstream media President Trump's approval rating\nIs the highest it's ever been\nOkay don't get too excited if forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually close the gap between disapproval and approval is now basically tied the Americans are evil evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nAh and ah then on Thursday I'll be home dotted willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's race and Senate races and more\nBut right now it's all so tight your vote really really\nMatters [noise] one of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when I had to change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle in Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and um\n[noise] in the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair\nAnd uh they showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd ask them why and he had no idea he couldn't answer it\nAnd the answer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nIs a um ten most Americans like the economic situation we're in\nPresident Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of a job uh meanwhile with an election this close\nVote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there is a new book ... that it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening and uh\n[noise] there is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana we did um [noise] a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a a a guy who said look I'm just a normal I'm middle aged\nA stay at home dad\nWho almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction\nAnd this individual by the way is for legalize marijuana\nIs going to be joining us on the show to tell his story and to answer your questions and to take your comments that all coming up on the Michael ... one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise]\nHonestly part of it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should have simply open the gate\nAnd and lead in all the people from the caravan\n... even those of us who support him immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants and I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that you get seven thousand people together and they're marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let them in because they're having a tough time in Honduras or there are a lot of suffering people right\nBut the notion that that uh that that his somehow what are the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea that President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea\nYou don't simply a let people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or and then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nMeanwhile somebody who seemed to have a position on everything\nBut I don't really think he has a position on the caravan because how could he be is a battle or Rourke\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he is he is now inspired people\nThis the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy he was called lie in bed and people say oh for Trump's such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together it happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George to ... uh age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty\nAttacked him pretty partially he said the Reagan was practicing voodoo economics and then later re embrace that Bhutto economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president and uh they honored and came to like each other or this is\nAll remarkable what is going on\nThe election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song\nOver the great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as NATO the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies like this\nI put my hands on God\nGuy is totally [noise]\nMovie memento\nOn the may do burn by turning tend to lose\n\n... now and then\n[noise] I mean\nMen oh you bet\nA little bit too little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs are in a campaign was President Trump\nYou remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one to get on the Trump train 'em in any event the better our work and the the ex to see about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people about ... work\nWhat what it is that the jurors the soul and and makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator and\nHe's a conscientious and substantive conservative\nAnd by the weight knows so much more about the issues than ... ... what is it the better our work is going to do for the country\nThat inspires reactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just a candidate he's a rock star listen I'm\nObvious strategies that are more than a in a modern show off everywhere on every one you can without interruption in from all that much I Love your thinking well you know [noise]\n[noise] okay um [noise] or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number of President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about uh the Democrats offering mom's not jobs or we will get to that and uh we will get to\nWhat the election comes down to there is also a a a a very alarming peace in the New York times at least is meant to be alarming I didn't think it sounded so bad\nYeah largely so what I think is happening as he watches Cory Booker a fall out of the race rather quickly and and I and my view was Warren\nA effectively disqualified herself last week probably in terms of the public relations although I think he's going to run for president he's going to lose the race and the Senate and he will be running for president and will probably be a pretty strong a candidate given his I don't agree with the views\nBut I think he could be very charismatic he could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a ... performing and it is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say\nWhen he was doing a town hall in or near El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN\n[noise] and uh she she stashed in very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years the senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively that it leads me to believe that you\nKnow he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he rules out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race he's going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some and then it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race was he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he has said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the Mueller investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish but needs to fish but that doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of those people on the far right the death for just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the kinds hey I appreciate your call um I I'm a I Will get back\nTo this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything what we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of the middle east to sort of flummoxed some of his age or there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that soon and very soon\nA and he says it said people are going to a lot of it's going to be a big middle tax a\nFlat tax cuts middle class tax cuts and a and and then there's this whole matter of a transgendered

for taking my call a fiery what about the uh the journalist where we are there's more to that and we really it's a start our country not anywhere I called to talk about the uh the plan to Beijing\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nYes sir\nWell eight or given the fact that we've had so far this year\nI think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hard right now people are getting across\nAnd ah this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system\nIs basically an attempt to raise the border and say that um we have to let anyone that wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that in the law doesn't say that so [noise] but when you say and and um planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUm I think it's just a part of the the war or the battle between conservatives and left or center trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of\nCourse they play a lot of very cold compassionate a video showing some of these poor people\nWho I think are hungry or scared I'm hopeful ah they they do not appear to be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and just say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatens to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent other incidents like this and so the ... every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now [noise]\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras some more livable place because that's really going to be the only kind of answer that has a long term impact on let's go to Marco in Los Angeles Marco you're on the show\nI might go a great job either way hey got three things I was calling regarding that that be a reporter that got killed I I feel that that really not our crime it rocket guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it\nBoth sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country installed\nOn because we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument is we ah we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia now of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world\nBut it's a country that we saw a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal\nAnd if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nA China or Russia and like\nWhy does that have to do what does have to do with this guy didn't kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow uh Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince and Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he ... obviously president from his never called on anyone to kill reporters\nAre and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference than it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte and one of the worst moments of his life losing his temper and slam slamming doing a body slam on a reporter yeah he shouldn't be making jokes about that\nA let's uh go\nTo Matt in Seattle Matt you're on the Michael met that show [noise] we'll ... we'll we'll be right back to you and

everybody who watch payroll processing or a chart done by a company with a guy like Tom who's really of like minded patriots because you made a point about visiting with a Congressman Steve ... she was almost killed on a baseball field in Virginia\nRight and and I think this is something if if everybody could take a moment and pause and think about the attack that happened and the baseball field\nIn DC right or Virginia or a year ago right and how they discovered that the perpetrator was a Bernie Sanders volunteer right then he had an actual hit list in his pocket right Republicans and he was going after literally\nAnd the way that the uh media treated that situation including you know the fact that he's going to the very fortunate man and to meet him and he's humble and grateful and\nHe was not carry it is not carry a grudge rice and compared to the coverage and the attribution or blaming that's going on right now is absolutely disgusting it's\nInsane I mean it's a it's a tale of two stories I mean it's all the the the hypocrisy it's like we almost forgotten that you wait and see the coverage of this nuts that they've arrested um and it certainly the president is going

that abuse\nOf some some lunatic crazy person who happens to support President Trump there'll be more media coverage about that on the eve of the terms then there were the congressional baseball field shootings last year\nYou've already correct and the question is going to be how connected was he or she just somebody who was just a a rabid fan and you know we've all seen those cars with those

I think it's called\n... Soto was found out\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from drug lords\nLatin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it\nThey were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people even if they ... they come in and start working their kids will grow up properly I public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps were right away refugees get a get our oh honey pots full of benefits from the government\nSo why don't you think is going to happen when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump should ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using it defense funds\nTo start constructing the wall to wall he ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall led Congress scream and yell blood judges scream and yell he should for their court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and you and take money away from a gardening Afghanistan's border if necessary to guard at the United states border\nThat's what we elected him for we didn't like Jeb Bush like Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First if we're going to be global policemen you know charity begins at home and there's a crucial point I think because people feel a sense of moral moral ambivalence all\nAll these people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world if you are going to say that you if you pick up and Honduras and say this sucks\nI'm outta here I'm going to the U. S. um if that is enough to get you went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to virtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could see the world in the United states and our welfare system will be back within you know\nThirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves\nAs we you know starve to death and watch the civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into it\nWhat I call a cockatoo and like so many other parts of the world but what\nAbout the moral argument\nI think we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes\nIf ... if somebody bags on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room you have the right to shut the door and use whatever forces\nAre required to stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will be accepting thing occurs applies to us as a country\nIs our country of coming home that we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept a new commercial or something to offer more\nAre we just on a giant refugee\nCamp like the ones we see you know in Turkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him in and you put them on the same girl and give them the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash as you know trash cans with a fire in the future of America\nTo me politically ... gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important Russian will look right and I I I I worry given the ... the media\nThat we will just have a video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice personal border guard\nPushing some mom with a baby and then uh it's it's it seems to me the when the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and get Senator George Soros funded attorney\nNo that's not to forgive me John that's not the propaganda war that swimming the war I agree but the propaganda war you know me I I think one of those ... let me let me just breaking\nPoint it seems to me that they win if they get in and the women say don't get it and\nI don't know because if they oh good I Hope you're right I Know I thought you were right\nI think if Trump shows weakness\nIf he came and then Republicans across the country\nWe just our hearts saying we realize the game is or even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status if even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turn\nOut I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you um do I think at the dance farm it's\nEasier to learn that that will mean in picture in real for him that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see that this is an invasion\nThey can see it the people who are going to cry\nBecause a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out for its war and otherwise going to turn out this is a national impeachment or trend them a less bases all ready fanatical there they've got their their ... already\nThere ready to go to the poll they've got their dead people registered to vote the left is all ready at its maximum frenzy\nAnd hysteria they've maxed out\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base and wake up the patriotic Americans who say wait a

least one of them there was a real mom the president's condemned the vice president condemned that Rod Rosenstein condemned it I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either some not in the basement where it's a hospital power messing with our election\nBut what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI Love it it's the media dealing with the media does which which is any any narrative that they can twist against Trump will do so that's just terrorists from eight to ... this is terrorism with whoever the terrorist is a need to be cost you need to be prosecuted and he put in jail for a long long time\nAnd uh and and I thought that it that'll happen you know it's
