I got that sign on an affidavit owned a roast\nTable you know public yeah let's take away their free speech should be good at least free public space I can still talk to people [noise] uh I guess they can go to you know non sectarian type things and yet we're obviously being facetious 'cause there's no way he wasn't I Am there's no way they'd have agreed to leave the uh public scene\nBut speaking of the public scene and not leaving it I think my costs a challenge for me Michael in Cleveland you're on was mark\nSykes number one I'm not sure I can push commission apples and oranges and killed ... people okay get their point is yeah I mean\nYeah let's do one at a time so who killed the eleven people that you're you're not blaming President Trump's that are you\nOn that President Trump but I Do but the guy goes on April ... anti Trump like I was anti Obama 'cause I didn't go to like find here\nBut it doesn't matter because you can't unless you're blaming him ... you you can't be responsible for every lunatic just like I don't want Bernie Sanders to be responsible for the guy who supported him\nIt's marketed for fact with you again showing for Dennis prayers in my second decade of doing that have been a real privilege to keep in touch with me and\nSee where I Am on the air next on my Web page of the mark I show dot com\nWhere you can email me following me on Facebook or leave me a message but it was always you can get in touch with me at ... dot com M. A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. and let me know what you think and I try to respond to all of those emails\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I pure besides filling in for Dennis or or Larry on the ... radio network\nIn the last hour where he certainly talking about ... shootings at the temple\nAnd and then and it's kind of evolved into a people blaming certainly the media and of course the Democrats left it's all the same thing these days blaming President Trump\nFor the pipe bomber blaming President Trump for the shootings at the temple it never ceases to amaze me that everything that goes on that's bad it's his fault [noise]\nAnd um even in the most serious charges against and the one I think that most offended up being the press is that the people\nThat pushes the enemy that people which I think they are because they don't report the news objectively and that was basic to our founding that they'd be a free press a new reporting the facts and not giving into government figures that they agreed with and make\nIt easier like they get our President Obama and by the way speaking President Obama he said some awful things to that to to incite people like me normally column met her people like make sure that we have that clip let's play\nHow\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] so why isn't bad inciting people to violence did you see how he says so passionately and and it you know the anger in his voice as that ... people on my side let alone President Trump that were against people based on how they look or how they pray daily\nWhen did that first happened I didn't I must have missed that or when he was looking for the compassionate Republicans right he really means the Republicans that don't stand up for themselves but I Love the last one 'cause I was going to talk about illegal immigration in this hour\nRipping immigrant children you know it's not illegal immigrants but I think immigrant children\nAnd and talking about from the cold cells running them out of the arms the mothers or fathers and and you know however you put I I'm paraphrasing and they wind up in a in a coal sell how isn't that incitement on his side for somebody but yeah you do that or take children away from their parents we better do something about how come when he does it\nIt's okay how come when he he actually is lying about opposition\nWorst President Trump blind I Want you to point that out in terms of\nLeaving them in a cold sell\nCars that makes me pretty angry how come it's not on their side\nThat that that's OK when they do but it's only President Trump you see the visceral hatred for this president\nAnd as I mentioned Larry show friday you know the reason for it is because we finally have a Republican who's standing up to the other side who doesn't let them get away with anything\nLook like you I'm not thrilled with everything he says is Dennis as you get the total package with everybody but the fact is they hate him to hate him with a passion because finally someone standing up to them that's what I think\nSomeone is really not letting them get away with it remember John McCain didn't do anything about personal bombing he didn't want people to even mention the fact\nThat he may have been you know the way he talked about the America should I Apologize and you know the issue about where he was born I get that one but you can't say anything about President Obama that was sacrilegious so to speak but it's okay you can if you want to say about President Trump is okay and the press is complicit with this\nSo yeah on my side you can't say anything but on the other side you could do what you want\nAnd it was very hard I got to tell you it was very hard for me is the last quarter last hour said even some Jewish leaders I shouldn't say even what a surprise most of them are on the left to say all the climate from the top down\nThat's what you're doing that's what's creating madman well let me tell you if I was a little over the edge what President Obama did good maybe if I was a crazy evil person maybe it could push me over the edge\nHow can you compare that mark how could you say that a president bombers just as great\nNow he he liked Obama again when that Sony town came out on all that that freedom of speech but that movie and I liked that movie I even laugh at that movie and really\nI Would like to kill Kim\nJong il All right so then he looked like him to kill can Johnny when he came down there and said why do they want to kill me completely and totally different ways and write him he realizes it came to John on one could go like that here in the background\nAny take that into consideration now what do we have we have the south Korean president who is Catholic [noise] taking a letter could poke can\nCome over and visit North Korean peninsula we no longer have that boy ... came at Hawaii and I finally worked and shot it back he's not wrapping\nMissiles into their place near Japan are flying over it or threatening to attack Guam\nAnd that's the only one thing he's gotten in other countries and and that he had gotten in our country to point eight per cent raise and Social Security this year ... people on Social Security\nYeah he's done he's done a lot there's no doubt about that and they don't want to acknowledge that in any way let's go to Jerry in uh San jose jury you're on was mark\nCan I can\nOkay great my point is when President Trump has asked for someone to get rocked up whatever somebody talking squabble and it's that particular person but what appalls me is that democratic leaders would say\nKick everybody be uncomfortable to everybody and I think ... if you're wondering oh because if there's any disruptor he should be taken care of it is\nAbsolutely absolutely want to go to as many colds I Can't Judy in books in my hometown Judy you're on was mark\nI'm like I think everyone canceled Brooklyn I think\nNo I really did come from [laughter] no no no I'm\nGetting like

Australia but I came in it it is well how can I can tell you this is the best country not never let country ever very grateful so I'm calling because I I ...
