needless to say that they ruled against\nAgainst up Baron Hill stuff's men and the ACLU which has almost unlimited funds has also joined the fight\nShe stands to lose everything and they are defending her they already one such a case in the Supreme Court so now what's review where it's at now a lady's if I if we may so with the ... the Supreme Court said to the Washington Supreme Court the U.S Supreme Court said\nYou have to review the case now since I'm not a lawyer what does that mean why won't the Supreme Court of Washington just say okay we'll review it and then come back with the same verdict\nWell then if they may very well do so um you know given the political ramifications and and what their benches I'm a late last night to nothing so I don't know what they'll do but I Do know that the U.S Supreme Court told them\nThat they need to consider the case again and new in light of masterpiece the ... that the attorney general's office has\nExpressed toward barren out the double

second column in the Washington Post they have a feminist column in the Washington Post where women were feminist or one I think in particular the feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them\nOn the plane last night and I I share some of them with you know somewhat the coach and I think\nThat these are so important to understand the damage\nThat feminism in him it's ... it's make believe world ... oil is a step emanates from the west or make believe socialism is make believe and feminism is make believe you ... is make believe patrol make believe\nFor whatever reason and it's all psychological what ... ... it's there's no other explanation there was a beep beep\nBeep or unhappiness maladaptive\nMiss to reality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who develop them to have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse\nOr is are the chances of making the world's worst or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea [noise]\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation but overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream up something better which is what character respects the character respectable left\nRemember from the ... to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen she writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post that I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a metal leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she should they're interchangeable they have feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nBut but it is interesting that there is no mention in any of the columns by her or older women writing this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so thoroughly used to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the the word marriage does not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken but cheap ... there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to which way you show loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing temporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what she described that argument while I ascribe to two\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours and he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch he said whatever you're comfortable with and\nNow I read to read from her over the course of three hours that lie became as ... ... she didn't like that and then why even not only put an bold for myself to underline what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug that it was not sexy being the woman the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if they're managing the driver CDs patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy well and then she wonders why she has never been so lonely in her life\nBecause bought but the the feminists like Old West his lip and to make believe world\nReality it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world were things will be better so she says if the ... the man is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flags that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every movie makes but of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this they they have to say that they want their cake and eat it it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important at every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and belief not personal appetite and blind conquest you're going to move personal appetite from sex all its good obese care healing and relief sounds like a visit to a social worker or therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October fifth do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox\nOK listen to this this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh Detroit the title but listen to this again\nI told a friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships and memorably can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman their children left his two children that they do want to grow up I\nWant to be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships inevitably can bring\nWhy don't you say that about anything else I'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that working for a living can bring\nI Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life is never the bleak can bring\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart children they do not want to grow up growing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms and all of that stuff\nThey are snowflakes some of them are even my snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups\nDoes it amazing thing she admits this like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post how lonely she is and how crappy relations between men and women are I now I continue reading at that\nMoment it felt difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of the leaders feel stuck in the same\nDilemma really that's not true\nLeftist leaders are stuck in this dilemma conservatives have mature understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is paying in life this is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over ... little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be out in the first call by the way just to remind her the ... my uh\nThe the rational bibles this my five volume commentary on the first five volumes it's been so successful the we're going on the fourth printing of ... is the first volume was on the second book\nYes yes I don't want to wait so uh so we don't allow me forgive me I just want to understand you I don't want to argue with you watched one on staying you you you you would not seek to remarry because you don't want to be hurt and you don't want to hurt someone else\nThat that yes and I don't I don't doubt it\nOh okay that's a separate okay that's\nRight that's different but first of all this woman is is is is middle aged white suit she's in you know forty to fifty\nUh and uh she she never even mentioned that she just talks about relationships where am I think that she would do better if she actually saw to get married but I wasn't at all the basis of my critique by the basis of my critique was\nThat she's ... she's very lonely she doesn't like the idea of a man just to is it not assertive and\nThen if you use assertive than he's obviously a not someone she feel safe with so no wonder she's lonely\nI think part of it

Central American countries that are facilitating there's big migrant\nA parade the president said I'm much\nIn the strongest of terms ask Mexico to stop this onslaught and able to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nWow would that not be incredible to put the military along the southern border\nIn another tweet the president should gesture that the onslaught of immigrants could threaten the recently reworking trade deal with Mexico and Canada\nThe president said that immigration is far more important to him as president the trade now liberals here this news
