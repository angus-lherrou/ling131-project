to hockey games every way just I did I did leave a normal life semi normal [noise]\nAnyway the ultimate issues our I'm Dennis Prager and I have a truly a terrific guests man I have tremendous respect for Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture at the discovery Institute in Seattle or would you tell people I think it's important given that\nWe're going to talk about science and face so 'til people don't be humble about some of your credentials in the in that arena\nSure um I as you mentioned direct is a network of scientist or run out of the discovery Institute in Seattle [noise]\nUh uh my ... and the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge in England prior to that I worked as a geophysicist and did a double a physics geology or science degree in undergraduate and um [noise]\nAh Britain a couple a couple of bucks one signature on the cell and the question of the origin of the first life and the second one called Darwin's doubt\nA which is a question of about the origin of the first animals which uh prepare very abruptly in the fossil record in Contra addiction to Darwin's own expectations of a very gradual origin for for animal life so your life has been immersed\nIn science by the way just I've never asked you this and all our time both privately and the radio when public what does the philosophy of science\nMean [noise] it's the it's the discipline that addresses scientific questions that are right at the margin of science and philosophy things about\nThe nature and uh [noise] basis of human knowledge the what's called in philosophy pissed about how we know what we know but also questions about a new consciousness the origin of the university origin of life [noise]\nUm [noise] and needed is that the topics that have always really fascinated me how did we get here how did life get here\nUm there's a huge scientific dimension to these questions but they also have incorrigible eve philosophical implications and so\nI've always been attracted right at that boundary between the two and you have to learn a lot of science to be any good in it and you have to be thinking philosophically to make any sense of a\nGreat combination did you enjoy your time became a mentally really now if you have to do if you have to do something is grueling as a PHD it's nice to do it in some place like Cambridge or Oxford weather a lot of cultural compensation some wonderful people and the weather helps the weather's awful but I'm going to Seattle so I was\nAlready not late at night I never thought about\nHis latest book which he edited is a collection of essays\nAnd don't let the title of it in any way that you prefer you stick evolution a scientific philosophical of logical critique Miller worth the ... revolution is\nThe attempt of many and very good will people to reconcile God and evolution and this is a series of essays critic critique critical of that position that position\nSo let me get to that the book is up a tennis player dot com and obviously I mean if you were interested in theology or science will find this immensely interesting\nSo I I missions you right before we went on the air that I until really I ... you to be honest\nUh my my view was I didn't really care about evolution and it didn't bother me if it was true and it didn't bother me if it wasn't true I Believe in God as the creator of happens in the earth the God of genesis one\nAnd if if God used evolution water why care it's all a miracle anyway so back in ... in a nutshell Ben I I read to you and talk to you\nAnd my wife frankly whose loans or a fair amount of you know about evolution and and uh it has become less and less tenable not for religious reasons but for scientific reasons\nToo but to\nEndorse the evolution as it is generally taught so before we get to garden evolution\nI noticed is ridiculous in the time that I'm getting me give you a couple of minutes can summarize\nEvolution and why it's now eh we might be skeptical about well not not only we yeah okay [noise] uh but but scientists right this is what you are but in my mind to scientists are having trouble with that but right right okay go ahead so quick\nDefinitions of the term evolution for orientation the first is simply change over time nobody nobody challenges that there has been change overtime or the kind of small scale variation we see in Galapagos spin speaks or peppered Mavs or um bacteria that acquire an to an antibiotic resistance that's sometimes called micro evolution\nUm second definition bed allusion is the idea of universal common descent and the idea that all organisms are connected by common ancestry back to one where very few simple forms such that the best picture of the history of life is like a giant branching tree as part of Darwin's argument\nAnd and the third most controversial meaning of evolution is the idea that there's an ... guided directed mechanism namely natural selection acting on random mutations that can produce all the new forms of life that have emerged in the history of life the producers all the change over time\nAnd that that mechanism um is also responsible for the appearance of design that that ... biological systems manifested even leading evolutionary biologist acknowledge\nSo those are three key definition is the first is a knock us nobody doubts that the second is somewhat controversial the third is relief stains on my second on the tree I'm I'm skeptical about the the universal common descent there's a lot of this continuity in the fossil record and then the genomic a patterns that we're now observing\nA but the key issue and the one that leading evolutionary biologist themselves are now questioning is the idea that the mutation selection mechanism as genuine creative power the ability to generate fundamentally new forms of life\nAh so what you hear a lot of evolutionary biologist quoting now an aphorism is that\nA mutation selection explains the survival but not the arrival of the fittest explains a small scale variations but nothing major innovations in virtue of that uh two years ago this time um I was at a conference that of the royal society in Britain the oldest or\nIn arguably must August scientific body in the world they called a conference to a assess modern neo Darwinism and specifically to call for\nA an a new theory of evolution many of the evolutionary biologist there were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation and selection as creative power the opening talk at the conference by gerd Mohler leading Austrian evolutionary biologist\nAnd numerous rated or several key what he called explanatory deficit of the modern version of Darwin's theory neo Darwinism that a number of the the the deficits that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis stunning the the Royal Society what is the full name\nThe royal society of London it was started by Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first\nPresident was yeah yeah just raving about them yesterday okay [noise] so they that's incredible that you had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation whip where most\nIf not all of the talks were were exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement compliment replace\nThe standard mutation selection mechanism the odd thing about the conference however was that uh there were a group of of what they called themselves the third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nAnd the and as we've understood more about the digital nature of the information that really isn't it alphabetical type of graphic or digital in character\nAnd uh and we understand that by reference to our own experience with computer code of the idea that you could randomly start to change very specific arranged\nThe ... of characters that are designed to construct one thing\nAnd turn them into another message that will construct another completely different thing it's implausible if you take a section of computer code and start randomly changing the zeroes and ones you're not going to produce a new program or operating system you're going to introduce glitches and bugs and you'll ... ultimately destroy the function of the original sequence that you had\nAnd the genetic sequences similarly vulnerable to that kind of\nA random mutations will change and yet the neo Darwinian invoke random mutations the ages of innovation the aging of creation when in fact it's either a an Asian of destruction or it can and introduce very minor preserve ... changes that might slightly tweak her optimize\nOur eyes and when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years\nWho have believed what you say is the cannibal what does that say if you are right what does that say about scientists that science like\nUh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to group think\nOr to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments\nIn particular in the debate about biological origin there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle known as methodological nationalism\nAnd it says that if you're going to be a true scientist you have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanation for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates which would be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle Ben precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered that the foundation of life we've discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates the our local hero in a in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program only much more complex than we've ever device but where does suffer come from it comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligent um\nActivity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that um are a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information\nAnd know persuasive Darwinian explanation has been offered for any of this type of complexity the integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe most likely all some aberration was born and prosper because it was better than the previous ... a ...\nA a a plausible theory in the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level\nUh in the wake of that theory of a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then as the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that would in any other realm of experience point to designing intelligence that the principal of methodological naturalism has prevented many scientists from considering the obvious right Haitian\nOkay I'm totally on board the ... the question that you have taught me to to ask is or even the people who only

new poll that came out a couple of hours ago NBC News marathon will look at this double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania hardly the first double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in

democratic state\nActually that don't want to say [laughter]\nYou know for Hillary Clinton [noise]\nWhat about Ohio we have a brand new part of Ohio Donald Trump doing a little better here but he's

protecting truck shrill oh\nAnother one brand new NBC Marist Poll out of Iowa today again a little bit closer\nBut a four point lead for Hillary Clinton this is supposed to be a light target for

twelve the Trump maybe it's just assuming he can a whole second this out\nBrand new numbers out of North Carolina North Carolina was Mitt Romney state in twenty twelve little right now in this poll Hillary Clinton has delayed very close certainly Donald Trump could still when I called a tossup states but we have seen polls putting Hillary Clinton ahead there it is possible Hillary Clinton could

thought about that when the when\nThe never turned up very much attention to one poll but I look at a trend a congresswoman Blackburn last\nUh September or anything on nine Fifteen CNN said you were behind your voter by five percent Fox News came back a couple of weeks later they said Marsha Blackburn up by five\nThen CBS News came back a few days later and they said Marsha Blackburn the prairie [laughter] and then the New York times came in two days ago and said you're up by fourteen what's going on in Tennessee you're you're surging eroded away with it\nEither positive message and getting out and people are focusing on that they want to make certain that they continue to have some more can constitutional\nJustices and judge it they want to keep the tax cuts they want to\nBuild the wall and they want to make certain that we are getting regulatory relief that we're dealing with the out of control spending and they're remembering some of the things Phil Bredesen dead as governor and if they really didn't like things like increasing the state budget by forty percent and getting\nPicked up on the house and the illegal aliens valid state issued taxpayer funded dry leaf certificates and barely member many drained the race fun and spent that money\nOn um on on the general fund and these are all things that they opposed they also he's are paying attention to the fact that\nHe was governor he had two different tracks for handling sexual harassment allegations and claims if your friend the pale does matters were handled privately and ... and\nOthers went through the regular state process\nSo people don't a light he'd get those things ... remember that they know that if he were to go to the U.S Senate that he would be his boss will be Chuck Schumer\nAnd that he had to have friends named Dianne Feinstein a Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker Kamala Harris and Tennessee and when he never go to the polls and vote for him though the individual but they know about the film breath and it's a ...\nTo be clear Marsha Blackburn you would have voted to confirm justice cabinet and he would have voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch\nCertainly by and I had no problem making up my mind about that because Tennessee and she may not want an activist judges they want and good\nConstruction is constitutional or set up by the U.S constitution\nEnded a little walk now my pen at a chicken eighty eight days and make it lined up on particular do an after the vote is can he said well I Would have voted yes and then of course of airtime video came out these shows and that that was probably\nNot a trace of state and said he said that for political a wreath on this and that was very revealing what it can say in that video\nI Do see some signs of desperation and so Brad Olson a congresswoman Blackburn who's now offered to meet with President Trump in other words is going down for the third time and he's got a hand above the water saying hey anybody pay attention to me\nI don't think President Trump's going to be invited into the rose garden anytime soon President Trump's with you and Mitch McConnell's with you and I guess it comes down to I always have faith\nIn the average voter understanding that the control the Senate go through every as fifty one vote she writes\nThat try to and\nTennessee and he can now that it failed daddy and were there it took me about the Democrats and he um he is trying to as you said this is a sign of desperation and he says I'll go meet with the president or you know he put your finger in the wind which way it's boiling and says yes I Would have voted\nFor cabinet out such a trace it that if he were in charge it's his friends Hillary Clinton said he get thirty three thousand four hundred dollars to long they turn to the president if she was president he somebody like a justice capitalize dying Feinstein\nChairman of the Judiciary Committee he would not have somebody like a justice Kavanaugh\nRon Paul because they would not allow it and that's what makes it\nAs they seem to think safe for Democrats to stay one thing they're campaigning into another thing to say\nNow was ... approaching congresswoman Blackburn
