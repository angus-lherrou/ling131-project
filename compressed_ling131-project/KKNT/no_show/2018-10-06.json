buy nice on the humane society the United states in the outcome so\nNo one one culture and politics is some Michael show\nThan another great day in the greatest nation on God's green earth it is a great day we have witnessed together a historic moment of decision\nWith the very memorable speech by Susan Collins the senator from Maine\nThe confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice of the United States Supreme court is assured\nThat vote will apparently occur sometime tomorrow in less through common consent to move it up\nTo respond to this moment in history this historic hinge and I think it is that this is the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation battle\nIn history nothing close no not cars well are ... words were actually voted down not Bork who was voted down\nThis has been the most ferocious battle royale somebody who is um had his own battles royal as Bill O'Reilly who is a friend of the show and a friend of mine and joins us now\nUh with reaction to what we've just witnessed a building you do take this as important a moment as I Do\n[noise] certainly is a turning point a for America historically and on the short term I think it will have a big influence on the boat coming up in November So it's hard to say that there's not an more important story I mean it's is it\nUm which one you want to check first\nWell let's let's first or take a look at what you think the impact is likely to be on the vote November\nWell I think it's gonna be a tremendous backlash against people um who espouse no presumption of innocence which is the Democratic party\nThe only one Democrat voting for capital on that show managing the senator from West Virginia one\nSo I'm not you know the other what forty seven are basically saying look we're with a mop where with the people who accused Kavanaugh without any corroborating evidence that the FBI is all ready now said there isn't any\nAnd we're still with the ... we we want to get the pitchforks and the and the fire porches and march up the hill okay so Americans are getting that they're getting it\nAnd they say well what if this happened to my father or brother or my husband would I Want to know presumption of innocence would I Want the man to be destroyed by allegation and of course the answer is going to be no salt the Republicans are smart and that's a big ...\nTell you that they run on two things the economy and the Democratic party rejecting the presumption of innocence and I think that both of those things will be helpful to geo pay a November\nNow one of the other things we now have officially the lowest unemployment rate in a forty nine years when three point seven percent ... you have to go back to Nineteen sixty nine\nTo find an unemployment rate this low that's that's no worthy to I ... I ... you talk about the presumption of innocence now again you're in a unique position talking about anything having to do with the hash tag ... two were accusations about\nMistreatment of women because that's had a very big impact on your life in your career\nOr do you think we may be reaching a turning point\nIn this whole narrative that says that anyone who makes any accusations had all\nShould be a ... instinctively support it do you think that is likely to begin to change\nYeah I'm constraint or what I can say because uh I have a legal legal action in play to restore my reputation and of course it takes\nA lot of money and a lot of time to do that so I Can't really get into my situation I can tell you the same people who are now paying demonstrators to disrupt the capital or will behind um my accusations and they paid people to stand out for a Fox News with pot same exact people\nRight same groups and it's outrageous it's an outrage the problem with the accusation industry and that's what it is now Michael can industry All right and it's run by two four six\n... lawyers who are shakedown auditors to know that they can uh get money from individuals and corporations just by the allegation because the corporations and individual so I Want to publish\nA shakedown industry has been in place now for decades but now you have the allegation industry used by political people All right so if we don't like Kavanaugh we can't defeat him on the merits\nIt was going to be confirmed so we're going to put out a a a letter from a woman who says well he he uh molested me when I was Fifteen Years old okay so that's what happened that's what happened that's what they did\nAnd of course the wild card and it's just the press and the press is the driver primary driver of the political allegation industry because the press doesn't care what is true\nThat you know searching it in my case at all none zero and we provided press outlets with the scope of tore evidence then in print it they wouldn't even use it I mean CNN use the word rape in conjunction with a cabin on more than a hundred times\nMore than a hundred times CNN are associated cabinet with rape\nAnd none of these accusers uh uh ... ever even alleged that he raped anyone did they\nKnow a while one day I wanted a ... that that\n... next said as as sweating and said she thought he participated in a drug gang spiking punch and things that\nGirls could be right by a line of boys\nRight and which which had in the beginning the cabin always in the line and then she hold back on that\nOne out what I'm trying to get across is and this is very important for people understand is that the corrupt American media and it is as corrupted has ever been in our republic doesn't care what happened they want the salacious headline alright they want to tag powerful people with this\nOkay let me just interrupt you for a moment and a rather momentous announcement a Joe mansion just vote yes\nHe will vote yes on Kavanaugh which means that he is a sure now of fifty one votes he will be confirmed teenaged fifty go ahead\n[noise] mansion in you know if he wants Collins came across mentioned and had nothing to lose\nSo I'm not either I'd like Collins was sincere and somewhat brave but mansion I mentioned I like jogging on 'em but he just waited back and say oh well now it's a sure thing so I'll say yes\nBecause as you know if it's a tie in the Senate the vice president breaks the tie and a cat and mouse favor right match without putting any currency on the line now because Schumer the Senate minority leader threatened to all the Democratic senators by saying if you support Kavanaugh will cut off all your money\nSo when you run for reelection not getting any money from the national committee\nSchumer did\nDon't you think this is gonna Heidi Heitkamp who's already running I think nine or ten points behind\nA in her race North Dakota I held in back and and she'll lose in North Dakota\nYeah but but again it's hard to understand\nWhy at that you see this this was a point when you listen to senator Collins\nShe brought out to a point that that look at a Brett Kavanaugh is not some extreme legal theorist he's respected judge he's right in the Republican mainstream\nHe's about as a moderate and appointee as they could possibly hope for from Donald J Tom so what's what is behind this this hysterical this is what\nDemocracy looks like no no ... got to do\nThe demonstrators and the craziness that they're not all rented demonstrators Amy Schumer got herself arrested ... what does she have in this fight\n[noise] abortion what it is the progressive left knows that the states many of the Mississippi is the latest and misery in there as well are trying to limit\nA timeframe on abortion abortion clinic access things like that\nSo many of those cases will go to the Supreme Court and a Kavanaugh will most likely come down on the side that the states have a right to regulate commerce\nIs what abortions come down to now Planned Parenthood\nI knew the doctor forge presentation which only about what may have happened to her but it was about politics as soon as I saw her attorneys were I knew was politics and that has been now proven\nThat they're the political component in the whole Ford a hierarchy the whole crew was designed to get Kavanaugh and all the people in the crew or cat haters and that's bad if you were an aggrieved American and\nYou had been mistreated you don't go out and hire an ideological lawyer you hire the best forensic lawyer you can fire that's what you do\nSo it was too much money and it's too much political shenanigans going on for me to be optimistic that we'll ever have a fair process of a confirming anyone in this country at least in the short\nTerm don't you suspect that and by the way I Do think that it's more likely than not that President Trump is going to get in his first term and ... and that's even assuming that against his second term but in his first term he could very well get another Supreme Court appointment\nWhich was already on our last word [laughter] you know I don't know what I'm saying that way she said you know I I mean she's eighty five years younger and now she's eighty five eighty five ... she's dying breath areas or why he's seven a year or two\nYeah he's he's yes I think he may be Seventy nine he's yet they're they're both under\nThese liberal alliance and um the as you said and it could happen any time so but the court now is uh where Trump watch the debate is going to be a Republican you voted for him you don't like them you know like a style you know like your handled himself now um the court is a traditional court again\nBut it's if he if Trump and let's say that Justice Ginsburg resigns and President Trump a points Amy Coney Barrett who apparently was the runner up to ... I don't and then she\nWill be the next nominee if Trump gets it\nYeah and and it'd be the one and and don't you think they will try to attack her as a quote Catholic fanatic and he's had seven children and of course I Do uh they'll try to painters some Amish person [laughter] I didn't get any more [laughter] not not not that there's anything wrong with ...\nYou know I mean in the extremists are never going to have not I mean that's the lifestyle a live\nUm you know a civil shows just\nBack to this Media Analysis which you've just been putting forward don't you think there should be room for the same way that Roger ales started Fox News recognizing there was room and the market that there needed to be a conservative voice\nUh don't you think there should be room for something more up to the middle than what we got right now\nSure ah and I think that you could make money doing it [laughter] but it's not easy and it requires a tremendous investment um people come to me all the time I go and say once you go back on TV once you do this once you get back\nAnd you know I'm not going to do that because I like right on my own show on Bill O'Reilly dot com the c._e._o. and I'm the commentary\nOr what about the O'Reilly network\nYou know it takes it will take two hundred million dollars that's what it's going to take to get up and running and compete so it could happen somebody could ah go I'm or could come out with them and I think you're absolutely right that make money\nWhat about the Koch brothers\nI don't know much about the Koch brothers I'm not one of them I mean I think it was David Koch I met him once you get on the part I don't know much about\nTheir charitable people and I think they do believe in a um\nA more a middle a column as you see I'm kind of conservatism or coming coming up a Senator Lindsey Graham just focus on the Senate floor\nMemorable as often as I said it was Bill O'Reilly his new book killing the ss comes out next week sill I Wish you Godspeed always appreciate your voice and your insights we will be right back on the ...

fifty two we ought to get\nHe um he has all the Republicans in the U.S Senate except for Murkowski and he does have one Democrat or the um moved Democrat Joe Manchin so there is he has fifty one boats\nOr what Sarah Palin is talking about is a Lisa Murkowski the senator from Alaska who voted against Kavanaugh's up for reelection in two thousand and twenty two\nDidn't attack anybody didn't

of matching fund go to eight six six\nNine five four thirty three eighty eight\nA meanwhile let me just share with you some of what a Brett Kavanaugh wrote and and it's\nNow they are declaring even over at NBC they have up there no more undecided vote on Kavanaugh\nEveryone has announced all the Republicans plus Joe mansion with the exception of Lisa Murkowski voting yes that means fifty one vote yes on confirming Kavanaugh\nAll the Democrats with the exception of Joe mansion voting no and or the Democrats are joined by the one Republican dissenter Lisa Murkowski so pretty much a straight party line vote with one switch on each side\nUh fifty one forty nine vote it's one of the reasons that it's so important to get a better majority in the Senate\nOr today Brett Kavanaugh wrote\nSupreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle they do not caucus in separate rooms as I've said repeatedly if confirmed the court I Would be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and the laws of the United states I Would always try to be a team player\nDuring the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators\nThe only reason he didn't meet with all one hundred as most of the Democrats would meet with him\nThey refused and I explained my approach to belong\nHe writes I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee at I submitted written answers to nearly one thousand three hundred\nAdditional questions I was grateful for the opportunity after all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations\nMy time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced vial and violent threats\nHe writes I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I have ever been I might have been too emotional at times I Know that might tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said\nI Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son has been in that I testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge in person I've been for my entire twenty eight year legal

you're on the Michael mad show\nUm so I listen to all the time I agree with you about ten percent of the time [laughter] fair I'm In\nI'm you know I'm pretty left the service either and I'm like really disgusted with the whole circus that went on yeah in some ... and one thing that I haven't heard anybody mentioned it's been staffers\nKind of closing statements during the whole hearing when she basically pointing out that both of these people have been through hell and like he slapped but my own\nAnd that kind of an bodies how I feel like why does why do they have to do this in a public setting\nEither you're an average ... Lee right and and the senator Sasse is right and I share your feelings completely\nA look you know what the most damning thing wasn't senator Collins brought this out in her speech is that Dr Ford said that she didn't know that chairman Grassley had offered her to testify in private and this goes who I think what Bill O'Reilly\nWas saying the lawyers are Deborah cats and I think the other one was named brown which her two layers of big activists and they want to the public testimony to basically tried to smear and defeat Kavanaugh's private testimony would have been so much better and chairman Grassley offered they even offered to come out to California\nAnd testify her there if she was afraid to fly to paralyze she isn't really a face ready to fly [noise] look this was not malfeasance Hi Dr Ford was malfeasance by her lawyers who abused her as a pawn we'll be right back when I met that show [noise]\n\nCBS Sunday after sixty minutes one man I got a friend request from

justice no peace okay what is it that people are are demonstrating for exactly hear\nWhat is going on there's a little bit more of the demonstrations in all their glory [noise]\nAre court [noise]\nAnd

star is born\nAnd you know what this version starring I'm Bradley Cooper who again directed in coal producing coal ruined it everything for the film\nAnd they said that know what it takes to get the economy grow I write a obviously the president of the ... crater and felt knew firsthand what it takes to make job than to create jobs and to keep it going which was a pro growth economy\nHad lower regulation less red tape let government and lower taxes\nAnd these are the three things that are small business owners were asking for and they got on the receiving and small business optimism sky high consumer optimism sky high and you're seeing the results right three point seven percent unemployment rate record low numbers in terms of unemployment also tricks panic black\nHuge for example ... percent I I heard it's below ... percent now I mean if it's incredible but\nWe need folks who understand what it takes to make an economy grow and those are the people we currently have in place right now\nOkay so what happens if I'm In the ... a disaster happens for conservatives and the Democrats take over the house of representatives and they immediately focus on trying to wipe out the tax cuts what happens to the prosperity\nIt's going to go away I mean there is there's no other question I mean they have to point blank has\nA you know we've heard Nancy Pelosi said as we heard it looked with weren't they would for Bernie Sanders said as we heard Chuck Schumer said the bright that comes with a number and they take the house over\nBut first thing they're going to do is working on repealing the tax cuts\nWhich has made which really made the United states go from one of the book and competitive countries across the globe to me most competitive country again back to be the envy of all trades partners across the country\nLook at the wonderful trade deals that are now are are now happening across the board look at the new NAFTA for example the U. S. M. C. A. is the president's climate\nMitt has now jumped story and making may factor for example\nBe alive and come back and true here in the United states that were ... factory jobs being created and President Obama if you remember that that could not be nuts they may actually it was done in this country\nYeah and and what is bizarre here is a again they not only one to raise taxes and they want to kill Medicare and effect because when they're talking about one third of all the Democrats in the house or co sponsoring a Medicare for all bill\nRight what happens to our whole Medicare system if you get into a situation where you're giving Medicare to people who are sixteen and twenty five and thirty a instead of reserving it for the senior citizens of actually paid for it\nI mean I go with this uh this is one of the biggest things that we have to talk about uh nobody's actually talk about ... thank you for bringing up this Medicare for all the expected costs for that is thirty seven trillion dollars\n... billion trillion so thirty seven thousand billion dollars I\nMean it's it's it's absolutely over ten years right so there's no way to that sustainable what's going to end up happening is Medicare for all medicine for nothing right as far as I'm concerned is going to be the same thing that happened with Obamacare you're basically setting up and\nThat can input on it because they can get not survive that way we're going to eventually go back exactly where the Democrats want to go which is a single payer system period\nOkay right now the these congressional races are are so close I I Do want people to get involved and you can get involved by going to tax cuts work dot com it's a great source of information and engagement\nAnd getting engaged is the crucial thing one of the points that people have made is that\nOne of the impact of this whole ... thing is a lot of Republicans who are kind of sitting back and enjoying some of the economic good news and some of the good news on foreign policy we're just taking it easy they weren't particularly excited or worried about this election time they get excited don't you think\nAbout Michael absolutely I mean one of the things you've been around obviously a while and then re election season and they called the October surprise I think the October surprise here is that the Democrats are prices so how this whole thing Kavanaugh thing blew up in their faith\nUm and and we're going to see that enthusiasm gap for example in the past week alone I think we've seen that not only in the state by state level but across the country at a closed up almost entirely\nAnd so you know people are very upset with what went on there and at the end you know honestly this entire election Michael we were kind of like a big choice election right and voters are going to have to make a big choice are gonna have to vote for Republicans can build on the economic opportunity right\nIn can improve the lives of nearly every single American or they can vote for the Democrats who have promise to raise our taxes and throw really stand an entire gears him this morning to cut the choice really frankly it's clear\nI Am now and again a and B it's actually clear because what you are voting for your voting for people like Maxine Waters would become a committee chair in the house if the Democrats have ever Maxine\nWaters a committee chair\nAnd and Jerry Nadler of New York he would be head of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already promised to try to impeach Brett Kavanaugh um look but we we're

Passover and so on it [noise] it just says you\nCan't do work so I don't do work\n\nFact you should see my column this week\nIt is a is explaining the left\nAnd its contempt for the middle class bourgeois Judeo Christian values system and that explains\nTheir belief is that they are that normal moral rules do not govern them that is why they can shout down people at a restaurant conservatives do not because they believe there are rules that govern them\nThat's why they can close bridges because they don't believe rules govern them this is an extremely important thing\nThe smearing of judge Kavanaugh on an unprecedented unprecedented smear up a good man I I we have in fact Alan Dershowitz calls it worse than McCarthyism man has been a is a lifelong Democrat because he's a liberal\nAnd he

or do not they are governed by what they feel is necessary to achieve their ends they break eggs to make a left wing omelets\nAnd that is what we are seeing a happening I mean we I I got on to that because I was explaining I Do feel governed by rules\nSee you can yell at you know that's why I've said also often you could yellow conservatives for being hypocrites because they have a standard\nBut you can't ... who is a yelled at left wing hypocrisy there's no such thing as left wing hypocrisy because there are no rules that govern them so you can't be a hypocrite if you don't promote that rules\n\n... by the way another another matter in this regard my original column that this ... this chart should have been ignored it was right on I'm the only one to the best of my knowledge riding on this in the national media\nOr they may have been others I I I I certainly hope there were actually my point is not to tell you that I'm great my point is to tell you that I was alone are largely alone\n\nI said from the beginning a man who has an impeccable life as an adult\nI Am not interested in what he did in high school I Would have held this for Merrick Garland had he been the nominee I

a guy's face in a bar through icing the guy's face fall in college\nSo what so what [noise]\nThe reason that left this don't have any problem with doing this\nIs they are ... they are they believe that getting rid of his nomination before the elections is a good that overwhelms moral norms you can destroy a man and his family a good man and his family\nBecause overriding that\nIs the good of not allowing for the first time in the lives of just about any American conservatives to have a majority on the Supreme Court\n\nI Can't speak for before Nineteen sixty two but I can tell you about Nineteen sixty two it was already governed by the left because they ruled that prayer in school\nIs unconstitutional as idiotic as a whole series of uh as as an judicial forget idiotic\nAs not based on the constitution but based on what people left of center think is right that's all that matters the constitution doesn't matter the Bible doesn't matter to a leftist their feelings or their moral

[noise]\n\nAnd I promise I'm getting the point but I've been rambling here for a while but I promise I'm getting to a point here how do you make good decisions and avoid being surprised because hey it's one thing to be surprised with little Julie on a Piglet out in Gilbert, Arizona you know it's not fun what's not even somewhat humorous is being surprised with your life savings\nHaving things occur that are completely unexpected you were not prepared for and to them to focus on for specific areas that you do not want to be surprised\nWhen it comes to your life savings the first is taxes the second is fees that your pain the third is risk way more risk than you thought you had and the fourth is income if you're in retirement you don't want to be surprised at the end comes not going to last or that it's not there for you\nAnd I'm going to unpack all four of those things as we work\nDown the show before we jump into that if you are unfamiliar who's Keystone well partners who are you John\nSo I'm the founding partner on the managing director of Keystone while partners we are in the independent the only credential group of ... we are registered investment advisor for meaning we do not operate under a broker dealer and our entire team of advisors we vacated broker dealers banks insurance companies that we all used to work for\nBecause we wanted to be true for a new series working directly for our clients reducing costs\nCutting out middlemen\nDo the best job possible for you that was my vision for starting Keystone partners we have offices in Chandler as well as the GOP still\nHave you never heard the show before we offer a one page retirement map or view\nWhich is our road map to overuse your entire financial situation we look at everything from taxes to income planning risk tolerance what rate of return on your money to be okay\nAnd we've done it for hundreds of folks just like you who called up the radio show\nCommon comes with no cost no obligation\nWere mature from I mean we are passionate about helping you do the best job possible with what you've worked or lifetime to say\nIf at the end of that you need our help will share with you how we help you but if you listen to show enough you will learn hopefully for me there's no pressure from us absolutely not if you need our help great if you don't you know where to find a scholar down the road but if you'd like that retirement map review it all starts with a phone call us at one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nSo you can call right now I have a team standing by one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nAnd they will simply schedule a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our credential financial advisors that you can just share what's going on in your life what your story is what you're looking for what your concerns are and if it makes sense for both of us will schedule in our visit\nFor you to get a second opinion and your entire life savings free of cost in an understandable clear breakdown on a one page retirement map that road maps your whole situation if you'd like to get that process started again it's complimentary no obligation it's one hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen hundred seven six seven\nFifteen Fifteen and now let's start here with the first thing that we do not want to be surprised on when it comes to our life savings and that is taxes now wire taxes important well let's just start there the challenge right now with tax planning in America is a very few Americans do any sort of actual tax plan\nAnd what do I mean well this may sound familiar to you what comes in your mailbox January February March when your tax once right and even on the envelope they do is the pleasure of St important tax documents and closed so you open it up and you start to file at your house and you start taking these statements your ten Ninety nine W. twos and you start putting them\nIn a folder and eventually by march you flip through it and say this is everything I normally get and you take that and you grab your tax organizer and you drive down your CPAs office and you drop everything off\nHey how you survive and taxis and everything going okay like how's life okay well great let us know when we come back and sign and you hold your breath for a few weeks and you come back and he signed him you ask them how much our what you're\nGetting back and you take the file and you go put it in your home office then you\nDust off your hands and you go okay well perfect I got to keep this three years for audits and until next year I guess I'm done with taxes or if you do it on TurboTax you do the exact same thing that just hop on TurboTax and fire taxes now the big problem with this is it nothing I described as proactive in any way nothing I described is going to reduce your tax bill moving forward\nBut that's what almost everyone does and the problem is most of your financial advisors I mean let's not be disillusioned when I worked on my master's degree I spent considerable time on tax and I don't say that to to my own horn but we focus\nA lot here keep saying well partners on tax plane if you have a financial advisor and I'm putting out of an air quotes if you have a financial advisor or a financial planner don't you think tax planning and your taxes is a massive part of your actual overall financial plan\nOf course it is it's huge\nAnd so if your financial advisors more interested in selling you investment products on behalf of their broker dealer than actually talking about tax or is it an expert in tax when you got a problem because we just had the biggest reform and you have a massive opportunity because we have twenty trillion dollars of national debt and taxes just went down\nSo if you're the free and you might want to be asking yourself should continue to do so\nWhat bracket am I really going to be in under this new tax law\nAnd I want to pick this backup after the break but if you're listening right now\nAnd you're like I don't know who this John guy is and I don't know much about Keystone well partners but I'm not getting any tax advice I Want to make available to you our retirement map of you ... you can call one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine members wanting a hundred Seventy six seven Fifteen Fifteen and have a team standing by right now to take your phone call\nAnd it's called the retirement mat for a reason it's our one page roadmap that overviews your entire financial situation and sometimes you're thinking you're several John it sounds kind of simple one page like is that too simple it is not too simple\nIn fact for most of you it'll be the first time you have ever sat down with an independent the only objective fiduciary whose putting your needs above selling the product so you can get an understandable and clear breakdown of exactly where you stand with your money and let me go over again the value that you get\nWhen you come in to be with us it keeps the well partners we have offices in Chandler as well as Scottsdale and we will list all your concerns and objectives right on the map and then we'll put her recommendations on there as well and tell you what we think you could be doing to improve your situation\nAnd obviously you be the judge as to whether you want to act upon those things\nBut ... we're going to provide you a retirement income projection\nAre you going to be okay and retirement will your income hold up and also are you taking those income distribution in the most tax efficient manner possible maybe even more importantly will help you answer the question what rate of return on your money do you need and retirement to accomplish all your goals because if someone needs a three percent rate of return\nThey can invest very differently than someone who needs a seven percent ready to return\nTo accomplish all their goals and the thing that we found here a Keystone in meeting with hundreds of folks just like you from the radio show\nWho've called in and requested this retirement preview very few people have any idea what that number is I mean how crazy is that we don't even know what rate of return we need to accomplish on our money to accomplish our goals to fulfill the things that matter to us in our lives will tell you that on his retirement ... the last thing
