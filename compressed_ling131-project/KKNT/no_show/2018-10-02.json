R. at AOL dot com Dennis will be back tomorrow which may have you done over the years and I appreciate that very much\nAnd you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter at the ... show and you'll find out where else I appear besides so against a dentist or Larry or whatever in the last star talked about the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh's nomination\nHearings and how despicable many of the Democrats on the left we're in our in many of you calling in stay there all try to get to in a little bit I just want to for some other ideas out to you\nI Want you to consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams here's the quotes is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished\nBut if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned\nPerhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial for innocence itself\nIs no protection and such an ideas that were to take cold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end up security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way the Democrats I'd throw out there know what they are unleashing do they care\nThey're destroying one of the basic tenants of our republic the presumption of innocence they are asking for trouble they're also asking for trouble if they want to go back to high school and check everybody's teenage years\nAmong us is so proud of those years and where's the bank account of thirty five years if he even admitted what he's accused of as a teenager\nThought we at least the left I thought they believed in redemption and they haven't at the left that wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offenses but now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high years\nAnd by the way I Believe you confess to some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the Senate and I thought Joe Biden plagiarize while he was in college how come he was vice president and senator cotton tweeted\nSenator watch this I knew about this but here's the tweet senator Blumenthal lied for years about serving in Vietnam which is all you need to know about his courage and honesty maybe he should reconsider before questioning judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nEven the New York times reported that this is me now Blumenthal has said he served in Vietnam when in fact as the times when the ... at least five military deferments and eventually landed a spot in the marine reserve where he used was ... was eventually guaranteed not to serve and the conflict itself\nSenator Blumenthal ask Kevin ... he was familiar with I mispronounced the Latin toss us in you know\nIt's also sitting on the bus which still legal principle that dictates jurors can rule a witness to be false and everything if he says one thing that is not true [noise] excuse me senator Blumenthal but that does that also apply to you\nOr do you have a six different now for lying\nI watch these hearings and I felt like I was living in an alternate universe tell me if he felt the same way if you're on the other side of not take if you and the other side of I Want to get calls from people who disagree why it all makes sense do you want to prayer seven seven six\nNow know the thing I Want you to considers this in my home state of California I suggested on Facebook that Senator Feinstein deserves consequences for her do publicity and Republicans should vote for her opponent who may be further less than she is like knowledge that\nMy brother another brother suggested this to me because what difference will make whether a leftist is replaced by a far left is\nI remember years ago comedian Mort Saul said that voters are often given a choice between Tweedle dum\nAnd Tweedle dum are now it's much less innocent than that and what's the big difference between a choice between left and far left one at least he's telling you where they stand and going for the kill all at once\nAnd the other is a phony torturing you slowly but surely that Senator Feinstein California's going down the tubes anyway\nSo why don't we let them get their Quaker I live here so we might be able to pick up a piece of sooner some day or maybe have ... as they've tried to do they can succeed and form their own Venezuela here\nOr member Governor Brown thinks global warming is the biggest issue we face and he is the sworn enemy of President Trump\nSomewhat then go to the left his utopia and let's get the pain over with what do you think of that idea let's get Republicans to vote for senator finds things far left opponent and give her some consequences for her to plus ... tell me what you think of that idea to add one a prayer seven seven six [noise]\nIt's time we realize we're in a civil war with the left for the soul of this country so you can tell me what you think\nThat at the phone number that are just a mentioned to you and just listening if you didn't hear the first hour the\nThe motions the outrage that this is capture to the American people like nothing else I don't think maybe since the OJ Simpson trial because you may be people out there starting to realize what we're in that to lie and they'll do anything to destroy somebody [noise]\nAll right I promised I go to your calls so let's go Tom has been waiting forever Tom and blend or you're on with mark\nMarket is great to hear you substituting so sue currently for that is I can talk to you again I really miss your old Saturday Night show a few killers guile\nWell you you gotta check face because I Do other stuff too so just to see where I Am okay\nLet's say me mark from the depression or am I to press just three and five year old granddaughter is with the and I tell you I I don't totally nuts without without sweethearts bark when you call Jeff Flake or pool is only one thing wrong we're solving fool [laughter] well\nI Know you'll never fallen into such an ardent Beagle eat what we read in the lead the\nMoral of [noise] wouldn't you agree with your hater matter what the foster could constantly does\nThe constitution the free market and personal freedom we know that\nIn the socialist state of California and art lovers\nOf socialism which is the government crushing people in the most\nVile way just look at Venezuela mark my fear is if we don't vote them out as you suggested we must they will get a stranglehold almost in perpetuity on Supreme Court\nThey will do anything they can push their freedom killing socialist agenda and the future of this concrete as the one great\nBastion of freedom that our founding fathers created will be forever gone\nThanks Tom and you said a very well I can I can feel free to say this Bill Clinton's line I can feel the pain out there in the the obvious and let's go to a I like Josh in San Antonio's question or comment go ahead Josh\nTaking my call sure\nYou know I just wanted to basically say that ah you know in my own reaction any way to the testimony early or testimony which I think Republicans may have gone at it a little bit\nWrong angle I think maybe that they were when you come on you can't really question anybody memory without coming up a little bit ... especially in a time when a victim you're talking about starting to think that they should have basically said hey we understand it you're ... you're given the climate company might have happened to you\nAnd your incredible without questioning that at all I think that what they should have done it that\nIf the if there was a terrible situation where somebody brought you have it in her brought you in a legit accusation but at no evidence what would you do and then I heard of that off and she would have no chance\nOther than to say that what happened is it requires corroborating evidence in order to destroy somebody's life I mean if they could have got around to that then they're going to be like do we need your help to bring some evidence that there is any evidence and then come there she wouldn't have been accused of not remembering\nI'd like your style that so that's what that would've been a good way to do it unless you may have different or lawyers who knows and they would have had some objections saying she's not here to answer that kind of a question I don't know\nSo in that sense I and you got to be careful look [noise] you know now I'm going to be to try to see Mitchell side the prosecutor side right they they picked a woman in the first place because they don't want to eleven men questioning or the fact that we've come to this\nPoint in the stage of America where you're the gender matters of the people questioning you just don't want the truth and you don't want the best people for a job that you got to have similar to what do I just read California just ... I think brown signed this\nThat on the board of directors they have to have a I don't know one or two women per whatever you want enough force companies have we women on the board why not just pick the best I said for years if you could get me and this is obviously relevant nine conservative black women on the Supreme Court I before\nI don't care what their gender is why we got into this\nBut it's not the world was thirty forty years ago company should want to pick the best people in California no you're mandated to have a certain number of women now so going back to my point to defend them they thought if I had a woman they would look bad I mean Republicans were afraid of our own shatter right\nThe courage is not there there's flake cause someone\nA costume or wherever it was an elevator on the floors of the Senate whatever and starts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to\nSuggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're where's the courage Democrats would give them credit for one thing they circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in that's been the problem with the Republicans do you really know what we're up against for them this war this is their religion\nThis is their God for many of them a lot of them probably do believe in God that's not my point\nI'm trying to say this is everything to them to get some Supreme Court because they've been using it to legislate\nAnd I understand why you're so unhappy [noise]\nUh someone said something about the left than I Am maybe they dropped off at waiting over an hour but let's go to Trisha in Denver, Colorado Colorado Tricia you're on with mark\nHigh pressure I think the ... neither desirable\nAnd and I go to the train our relative to all drinking ... on the air even relevant to get all we were took Frank insurance that\nLeno and narrow and went to an all time period end up going back well why on when I'm In that period that entire adult life\nThough are we still have a second language in which we call the ... [noise]\nI I'd like it but you're you're leaving out the part I just went over they don't have the courage\nThat afraid of their own shadow that's that by the way that was one of the reasons President Trump is so enduring to so many people yeah it gets himself in trouble with his tweets but he's like the first president to really stick up for what he believes in any you can't push 'em down you know and cut them off\nA and he actually says what he means kept himself in trouble a lot of times but isn't that what makes them so in theory that well we've been crying out for instead of these mushy Republicans and and a little more ... Collins of Maine and Murkowski of ah\nThe Alaska and I mentioned insurance just reminded me and Ann Romney goes ahead and says I support this week to hit us why Romney lost\nI was going to mention that to me we said come should we're willing to do battle see the Democrats skip is the less gets it and we do\nWhere Denis says it all the time we're in a new war might be civil let's hope it stays in a sense that now there's no bloodshed although I worry about that very much when I listen to your emotions I listened to the motions or the other side [noise]\nThis is scary where it's come where you could just make allegations and that's it and you could ruin someone's life tell me what you think mark I suffer\nDoes\nThere's good news for homebuyers struggling to come up with a down payment for new\nYears on the housing authority so plus program has opened up new doors and opportunities under the homeless programs you may qualify for a non refundable downpayment grant equal to five percent of belonged them out on a ... year fixed rate mortgage this will cover the down payment and most if not all of the closing costs as well as pre paid taxes and insurance to learn more about the many benefits of\nIts own sauce program called the Boswell to finance of America more insurance companies to name though two to six six fifty six sixty five\nWith over Twenty years variance and extensive marketing knowledge deepened guide you through the complex mortgage process and help you make an informed decision it's all the laws that financial America mortgage missing company new name so two to six six fifty six sixty five six oh two to six six fifty six sixty five\nOr go to Steve Oswald that mortgage ... to Ninety two in the middle is one of them want to be the whole nine one one he's\nUsing is a bridge between the material and spiritual\nMy name is Harvey lower\nAs a blind person you have to be aware that nobody can tell you what you can or can't do you really have to try\nMy mom got me a little radio in Nineteen forties\nWas the best Christmas present\nI ever got was eleven years old when I started to play music\nYeah and then the accordion and then the show\nMy wife was also one was a good cook when she died that's when I started meals on wheels\nAmerica let's do lunch\nOne in six senior spaces to turn 'em hunger and millions Marlin isolation drop off a hot meal and saying like how\nFallen cheer for meals on wheels on eating your lunch break and American Life to launch pad or try my meals on wheels America and the ad council\nOf actually going to shut up next we have ... who's a member of the shelter pet group that's right a coup known especially for the couch smuggling ball trees in space looking back yard and of course companionship\nBreed would you say ...

speaking of ways and\nTaught I mean it isn't taught in the schools that you are presumed innocent innocent I teach at a bought a and a ... what makes our system so special bustle what the Democrats are the what they're opening Pandora's box that they're opening ... good luck came back and remember Harry Reid with the nuclear option\nSo you can get the Supreme Court nomination when the over fifty votes or fifty votes tied the vice president votes\nThese guys got to be careful what they asked for but they don't care it's about power at the moment and they couldn't take that those are all coming from they could never accept that Donald Trump won the presidency and this is just ongoing it it wouldn't matter who we pick that's why I said I think in the first hour feed named the pope and wouldn't have mattered\nNone of it matters because they can't take the fact that he's president of United States and by the way through the great job because you have the never Trump has not accepting how terrific he's been from not just the Supreme Court choices the district court judges ah and ah you know I don't want to go over all the ... he's had been\nWell they are perennially that way it would be one thing if on one particular issue they were squishy or they do they had a certain level of commitment and sincerity ... important to me but it's an issue after issue the country playing hard to get and constantly jeopardizing the very thin working Republican majority we have the Senate\nSelf serving ... yeah go ahead well except they're going to be voting for Kavanaugh and I finally figured it out why not withstanding effect that voice quip coping independents moderates not reliable McConnell's a genius can't count the votes\nAnd are these women aren't there well I guess two of them are women it's like it's like a a certain certainly not and and what we've learned from the from the three maybe the holdouts is\nThat their understanding one thing if it's a Senate Democrat majority they lose all their committee assignments are they losing Ninety percent of their value washing dishes al ... you're not still will\nRealize that when the other party takes it you staff there and and it's significant\nAnd it's more a loser all of that you don't even get invited to the New York times Christmas Party yeah you guys are too good I'm not taking Jack's call San Antonio because it says get these two guys are on TALK show all I gave me jacks numbers the producer yeah could be who knows [noise]\nHave the Democrats so overplay their hand oh gosh yeah look the party the Democratic party has been completely taken over by the ... class and the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been back then sure entire life is kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems\nAnd the irony is that with all of a sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general is the co chaired a Democrat this is\nWhy you do when I have some conservatives talk about the ... it's all a conspiracy against ... or ... and they said it a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with a public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC when it's on their\n... whether it's Troy you look at the whole Johnny rose right yeah and you probably have Ninety five percent of the other people have lost their jobs or been demoted law are for urban kicked out are liberal Democrats there because they're in power just like Sacramento here in California for those who ... could be the same in your state capital if you have a capital where the Democrats are in control\nThan the sexual harassment they're going to be mainly Democrats\nWell not only that we lost free hardworking Democrats for those very charges I was in jail for another reason as well as in ... for the Democrats keep getting in trouble\nAnd you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there\nA while I Can't stand ... personally it is in his politics there\nHe probably shouldn't have left to set it because he was groping some woman's behind because I'm not saying what he did was right or whatever but but if they want to have that standard fine because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold there so that\nGets to my point and everybody's part what happens the presumption of innocence this road they've gone down well not so I just this whole process you if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years here\nIncluding Democrats who were to come forward said you know there's a reason why we have statue limitations this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there\nIt's from the high school and I was at a than a Senator Feinstein was it was a person of of the principal she would have dismissed the things that I Can't ... you've seen something happened in high school and and you know what what do we have nowadays is\nEverything is considered the same level as rape or a you know and and but it's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls but somebody in her hair or whatever and just makes it an unwelcome workplace\nSo we in effect had the effect of ... the real serious stuff of rape and all these things are putting everything on the same class what about Sarah find something this is the way she wants to go out and the end of her career at L. or slow remember how she got in in Nineteen Ninety two she was elected with Barbara Boxer and so called dear you're the one woman there were a boxer defeated\nFor services to women who search and singer dear old friend of mine there\nAnd they're showing mentioned find Saddam Hussein is water only by comparison your colleague Barbara Boxer all your national leaders of the national scene these two people typically boxer was most pernicious or they are\nAnd so you you know Senator Feinstein should be we're ... we're we're retired and she's saying I remember a six year term or are there and so these people just never want to leave the national stage\nAs Sean I wanted to ask both of you will Kevin uh yet be confirmed do we agree now I ... no doubt Ninety eight percent sure uh and that's been largely depending what called the FBI finds look there's another finding too I welcome the FBI or of of asking people question ... all one big reason most people that are going to be asking are accused owners\nAnd the the accusers liked to the FBI centered Bradley and Lindsey Graham of both said they need to be prosecuted and I think I think for herself was going to be under serious scrutiny when she has a statement of the day she has makes great inconsistencies I'm that suggests strongly that a U.S federal prosecutors actually ... anybody\nWanting your listeners may not realize when they see the ... century FBI stuff all\nThe way an FBI close works at that level you fill out a form I forget the number of cars I filled out and had to three hundred dollars you know it but yeah\nAnd you fill out the form and you lift people so suppose I listed Sean steals a friend of mine there which I Would have the bad judgment doing to me it was they were called valley but then they go to Sean and he says all these nice things about me but then they say well you know anybody else who knows a arty ... well I Know Sam and they were they take it then they go to those people and they say some nice things about me\nAnd they say well gee you know anybody else and they keep going till they finally find

the Democrats who hid her letter making uncorroborated accusations against capital for over a month dragged her into the national limelight and urged her to avoid meeting with the Senate Republican staff members at one Point New rights\nFord said she couldn't meet because she was afraid to fly\nAlthough it was revealed at Thursday's Judiciary Committee hearing that she has flown numerous times for vacations Ford was put through all of this even though she could not remembering what House the alleged gathering an assault on her took place or when it occurred at the same time no one she said was president has score operator her story\nHer testimony was emotionally compelling it's clear that something happened to her\nNewt Gingrich rights but she knows as a professional psychologist uh thirty six years after an event people can vividly remember things that didn't actually happen if Kavanaugh he says can be defeated by this kind of manufactured and manipulated evidence free process than what reasonable conservative would ever put his or her name up\nFor some Senate confirmation Newt Gingrich asks the real question is this are there any Democrats your disgusted by this process\nOf dishonest character assassination and manipulation or any upset that this is becoming their party's operating pattern are there any Democrats who sense of decency forces them to vote yes for a decent man and brilliant jurist whose entire public career\nHas exemplified honesty ... already and patriotism are there any Democrats you understand that a thirty six year old on supported

because it affects every single one of us it affects every one of our bank accounts it affects every one of our retirement our our ... our paychecks\nHere's a Peter Navarro this is a cut number one again just to manage the good news in a sea of bad news 'cause there's nothing really good about the cabin offshore nothing all we can do is hope and pray\nThat\nThe senators come to their senses the

couple of moments as well but I Want you to a sheet of White House trade advisories on Fox News over the weekend it's just cutting number one here is the way Peter Navarro describes what President Trump has done with our economy and trade\nPresident Donald Trump is very quietly been putting together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history\nAnd uh it's it's really truly extraordinary and I said quietly because the media has under report in both the actions we've taken and the results and exhibit a is this last week at the United nations\nWhere President Trump Oregon straight at a groundbreaking with South Korea open negotiation with Japan and work with our allies in Japan and Europe to issue strong statement against the behavior of China\nNow now if you need any proof about a corrupt news media all you have to do\nIs big knowledge what Peter Navarro says about the way the media has under reported\nAll of this huge news it's the Trump keeps winning I Know Trump haters hate to hear that\nI Know what makes you crazy to hear that\nIt's a fact he keeps winning he's not pulling the Dow out of his ear okay he's not making up the unemployment numbers this is not a tweet from the president at midnight\nThese are facts and um [noise]\nIt's part of why they're threatened by him it's part of why the left is so desperately trying to stop Brett Kavanaugh they figured this will be a major defeat for the president it will be incidentally if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed let's start with one of the big takeaways\nOf the last few days one of the biggest takeaways is watching this stunning\nUm crowing by leftists and activists and progress lives over the weekend on social media about how getting in people's faces screaming at them tricky to them cornering people like Jeff Flake\nEffect change this is why we do it\nThat's what they say Ana Marie Cox all these other folks got on social media this is why we get into your face this because it works Jeff Flake\nCaving and Jeff Flake changing his mind after he will be raided by the activists\nIn the elevator and they are activists I don't know if they were sexually assaulted it if they were my heart goes out to them as my heart goes out to any victim of sexual assault the Christian plus the Ford was sexually assaulted by heart goes after\nAnd as the president said her testimony was compelling what makes this an fulfilling for everybody is the fact that judge Kavanaugh's testimony was compelling as well\nIf you are wrongly accused of such a horrific thing I Would think you'd react with the world watching precisely the way he did without a doubt\nAnd so we are left with a he said she said here's a major takeaway\nIf Kavanaugh gets derailed and the confirmation fails\nIt's open season on every Republican in public office it is they're gonna they're gonna because they believe that that getting into somebody's space and shrieking and screaming and berating somebody in public works best what Senator Jeff flake gave them on friday\nHe has to know it can't be a stupid man\nAnd a word about Jeff Flake before we open up our phone lines and we dive into all of this here on a Monday as we get ready wrap it up for what's going to be undoubtedly a very tough week are worried about Jeff Flake raging about him he's as productive as complaining about the whether he is who he is\nHe admitted on sixty minutes last night shockingly but he would have never changed his mind the way he did friday\nIf he were up for reelection he told the world if I had any accountability here I'd never do this he thinks that's a good thing he he thought that was good to tell Scott Kelly of CBS and sixty minutes but if I had been up for reelection I would've never partnered with\nChris Coons from Delaware my buddy and I would've never started the day saying I'm a firmer yes\nAnd then with all the drama and the ... and the dramatic entrance into the chambers and sitting there and saying\nWell I Want this or additional seventh FBI background check I wouldn't have done that if I was up for reelection cause I'm retiring I'm leaving I'm walking out the door because my constituents do want me anymore in Arizona\nThat's where we are [noise] are numbers one eight hundred six five five Mike a welcoming I've got a lot to discuss today to break\nDown and watch

society foundations\nAnd be as a twenty fourteen you open society was one of the three largest donors to this organization John Fund says make no mistake the center for popular democracy is at the heart of the effort to stop cabinet show to activists\nWho are with this shore is funded organization where the women who shriek didn't scream at judge Kavanaugh when I mean a\nAt a breath or Jeff Jeff Flake you saw that painful video and he was squirming and shifting and looking down like he was about to break out into tears\nThat tortured look on his face that he always has because he
