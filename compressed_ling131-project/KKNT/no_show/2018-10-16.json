did not expect that at all\nBut that's the case\nAs I told twelve hundred nearly all Jews in LA last week by the way that talk is up on the Internet it's not on our website up but people should watch it\nFrom the left and the Jews and it said that the largest the synagogue west of the Mississippi Valley best show alone in\nIn Los Angeles I'm Sorry largest conservative yeah that's right those are

and\n[laughter] it's\nI said the reason that the talk came to mind is I said at the beginning of the talk as of this moment anything can happen of course but as of this molded this president is a great president\n\nHe is he's a great praise be not only beyond expectations team as he's done more for what I value and others who are not on the left value including\nLiberals but they don't know it because they've been so intimidated their whole lives into believing the right as the enemy\nBut as Alan Dershowitz said that left as the enemy of liberalism and I have said that over and over watch my video five minutes pick five minutes differences between left Mary mountain left or right sorry between liberal and left\nThe prayer you've come what's the video this week health care\nWhat's wrong with government what's wrong with the government run health care cost us a timely\n[noise]\n\nWow is there a battle so it turns out I was right there was a civil war in the United states even the left now acknowledges if they're writing about it that's correct but as I said most of my life only one side was fighting\nNow it may may be maybe capital was the final straw ... maybe while I reported last hour is the final straw\n\nA a a male winning the female bicyclists bicycle competition\nBut the male is a transgender woman she she identifies this person identifies as a female with a male body

they Ruben gay liberal and he is a he he understands the left see\nHIS Video while left the left or prayer you\n\nIf you're a liberal who thinks that the left is your ally you have been brainwashed there was no rational pop there's no possible rational reasons it's purely an emotional decision\n\nWhat is going to be the final straw to have people say that the left is a moderate destructive force any one of these things to Capitol hearing\nThe the ... the decimation of a good man by the Democratic party by\nThe way things happened so fast that is amazing fish it's so amazing how fast I predict that in my column that I wrote on the Capitol hearing now they'll go to elementary school and sure enough they did Stephen Miller the president's ah eight and speech writer now there's a report last

were no parameters you get to their moral parameters don't exist for the left every every parameters destroyed\nThe concept that essential to Judaism and Christianity that that is that if a person is turned their life around even assuming that this happened in high school the ... my argument was that he or she should not have been this hearing to begin with but it's no disrespect to the woman is simply\nI'm Sorry we are not going to have on the basis of one person in high school have a hearing about a man's life\nThis is not how we run the United States Senate they were willing to go to California to hear her do you realize how even for the Republicans fear of the left is greater than fear of God do you realize that they were going to go to California to a year or\n\nSomebody I'm Serious what if somebody said you know I when he was in ... when he was in tenth grade he held up a store why would you say\nSeriously that's a very serious thing with a gun he went with a gun and I could tell you I I I don't remember at the store a nobody else remembers that happening are but I'm telling you I I Know what happened would there be a hearing\n\nWhy not is armed robbery or an in consequential sin\n\nWe I watch on a daily basis to left destroyed the greatest country ever made and I don't know if the the these elections coming up\nWe'll be will be determinative on whether or not the left has gone too far because if they if they win the house or what you don't know chaos until you will know the next two years if they win the house they will immediately go for impeachment of the president they will try to impeach uh Kavanaugh\n\nThey will have hearings at every day on on on corruption in government for two more years we will be preoccupied with non news\n\nIt's a disgrace to vote Democrat and this and the like and the election sixteen days it's a disgrace\nEvery Republican loving should make that clear\nForget who my opponent is my opponents a Democrat that alone should invalidate you're voting for that person\nUnless you think that in fact the the the radicalism the society destroying the ideas of the left should be dominant in this country you don't vote Democrat\nDemocrat did the stance for destroy the beef stance for destruction that's what the motto should be\nThe ... that the Republican motto should be that\n\nAnd I joined the Rotary Club the ... valley Rotary Club and I told her story in my speech\nThat something hit me extremely powerfully\nYou know I don't know if that's still the ruins and Rotary Club but you have to be in the ... club you have to be the owner of a business or the head of something\nThat that was the way it worked for a chapter him I think only one per profession or something so if you're on a plane company you could be the head or if you if your principal you do that anyway I was the director of the Institute\nI apply sort of bring good will and I thought it was important so I applied I was admitted and I was the only Jew in the club\nAnd as I told him my speech what blew me away was it didn't mean a thing\nTo which all of you Being American little thing well of course it doesn't mean anything so you so you were the Rotary Club so what [laughter] that's the plan\nAmericans didn't understand what I understood even though I'm American but I had also talked Jewish history at Brooklyn College wrote a book on anti Semitism I knew a lot more than most Americans about such issues\nBecause there's no other place where it would have meant nothing\nIs that clear which the producers that clear no other place if I have been in a similarly small city\nRotary Club in France they wouldn't they wouldn't have necessarily been anti Semitic but it would've been doing the illusion reef Dennis the Jew\nOr in Holland or in England\nOr in Argentina or in Brazil wouldn't matter only in the United states ease it irrelevant\nWhat you are irrelevant where you come from your ethnicity or race your religion we

something here\nAbout\nOne of the seminal moments in my American is Asian\nI mean everybody almost everybody even if you're born in America even if your parents were born in America you have to be Americanized it it just ... you have to come to an appreciation of what we have here\nSo this was a seminal moment when I realized because I knew Jewish history so well again I I had been teaching and I'm a college level and wrote two books on it and I realized how unique unique not rare you make America was\nAnd people are at peace with that then I truly entertain the possibility there is nothing too far if ten years ago let alone forget twenty five years ago even ten people would be told that a biological male who said he's a female\nWouldn't win a women's bicycling contest they would have said that's ridiculous that's not fair you cannot have a biological bail otherwise that's the end of Women's Sports\nIf every biological male who was an athlete who wants to identify as as a female is allowed to play against females that's the end the female sports\nSo it shows you the left those are the I've always said that the left doesn't care about black select doesn't care about females that cares about power it cares about chaos it wishes to disrupt the ... the order of civilization as it stands it it's a force for chaos for anarchy\n\nThis is proof if they cared about women they would say it's not fair you can't have biological males compete against biological females\nBut they don't care\nBlacks are beginning to understand not in the numbers that I Would like to see but nevertheless I Would I Believe that it's significant Kanye West is is sort of a idiosyncratic tip of the iceberg\nOf a blacks oh just today by the way another another prominent black ... where is the story on joy here are going to call it up 'cause this is a this is a big deal may find this you know I Would like to bring to your attention\nAnd if I Can't right now I Will after the break open up a prominent black who's just announced that she is a Republican All right I'll bring a few later 'cause it's a it's a big deal that this is happening in a lot now\n\nAbout like you to see we've now put it up a dentist Prager dot com because I I gave you the wrong information earlier the talk that I gave\nThat the largest conservative synagogue a west the Mississippi and in LA last week about Jews and the left I I don't normally put by talks up by I give a gift for about a hundred fifty bucks for a year I I I mentioned almost none of them but this was a significant\nMy ... my embarrassment by my embarrassment\nAs a committed you have to support the ... that so many Jews have for the left it's just an embarrassment I I I don't know what else to say it's that they were synagogues that went into the Jewish morning ritual of sitting shiver after Donald Trump was elected\n\nIs is a disgrace to Judaism the disgraced a beautiful religion by taking a religious act and so politicizing it\nBut it's it's the narcissism of the left and obviously it's in the mainstream Protestantism it's a it's in the pope of the Catholic Church\nLeft as him as powerful everywhere and it's poisons everything but anyway you can you can watch my lecture it is up at Dennis Prager dot com and you click on it then you can you can see\nMy point was\nThe left doesn't care about Jews the left doesn't care about women and the left doesn't care about blacks the left cares about power\nThe the the the the Jewish issue is our biggest because there was no more significant issue to Jews who care about the Jewish survival than the survival of Israel and the Democratic party is now increasing the left is the center of anti Israel activism on earth\nIslamists and not all Muslims but Islamist Islamists and leftist all the most anti Israel forces in the world\nThat Jews would align themselves with with a force that wishes to help those who wish to destroy the the only Jewish state in two thousand years can only be described as pass a logic\nBut that is the way it is pathology is normal in human history [laughter] that it's sad to say and less of the human species\nBut this is it give away on the contempt for women that the left would support a biological male who identifies the female winning in a race so back to my original question I don't let the ... I talk about a lot of things but I don't let the original issue die\nIs there a point\nAt which people will say the left has gone too far I would've thought that the public humiliation I'll be truly good man would have been that point maybe it was we'll find out and sixteen days\nIf the if the Democrats when Congress or wind specifically the house\nThat will be a bad sign about Americans being comfortable with what the left is doing that is that is a very troubling idea\nWhat this president has achieved in foreign policy Iran is weaker than ever here is a simple fact but rock Obama strengthened\nThe Iranian regime and Donald Trump has weakened the Iranian regime on a\nPurely moral level forgetting every anything else just think about and good and evil\nYou are listening to them is pretty good show to Dennis Prager show\nLive from the relief factor pain freeze to the\nPrager here for ... at American federal rare coin and bullying for years I've been recommending precious metal dealers\nBut I wasn't sure where to turn when I wanted to make a change to my own portfolio strategy so I reached out to my good friend Michael ... he's been personally working with Nick ... at American federal for years and I couldn't be happier with Michael's recommendation but I was able to speak and work directly with American federals owner\nGrove itch I'm delighted to save the nickel ... pressure you went to buying high commission coins or gold but you don't meet if you have an existing portfolio and medical personally evaluate their holdings before\nHe makes any recommendations on of mixed specialties is converting them performing coin portfolios into gold silver all plot ... whether you're buying or selling microwave I recommended that you talked to ... first eight hundred two to one Seventy six million before\nThat's eight hundred to two ...

with the Kanye West treatment with the violence in the streets with yes the mob mentality of the Democrats\nYou got to vote you got to make it just you got to make a difference on November ... it's that simple and I think Jesse focused in this veteran democratic strategist has good reason\nNervous last night the president I watched his interview on sixty minutes with Leslie stall I thought if somebody was in a coma and they had woken up from a coma yesterday and turned on sixty minutes and just watch this president for the first time\nThey'd be in love with him\nThey wouldn't do they couldn't they wouldn't be able to believe that America elected a guy like this I mean he was he was on point he was so calm and confident uninsured\nAnd he was he he takes on the swamp he takes on the establishment it was a it was ... it was a poisoned interview here's ... number five from sixty minutes last night and this is not the first time that the president has as a you know visited with Leslie stall\nAnd he talks about the swamp I loved his comments about what Washington DC is comprised of this is why he got elected this is the reason this this unlikely president\nThis unlikely guy won this unlikely candidate one here's ... number five as the president's spells out for all the world to hear\nWhat Washington DC is made up this is audio and video courteous is courtesy of CBS sixty minutes and gravy and listen\nTo the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been press\nOkay so I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guys and bother [noise]\nNow I say that they be included that his political people this is the most deceptive vicious world it is and vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception team make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table\nI mean this is why he got elected it's just disgusting the way the establishment operates in Washington DC\nAnd then you know there's always a Trump moment there's always a moment something he says the media houses on during the Kavanaugh hearings it was at his rally in Mississippi where he\nSort of mimic door mocked or or or\nQuestioned the veracity of Dr Christine Blasey Ford's accusation against Brett Kavanaugh Leslie stall asked him about it this is cutting number for when the president acknowledged for to the food for the first time as far as I Know why he said what he said about Dr Ford cut for\nFly before I can remember [noise]\nMade that speech we would not have one that I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're trying to destroy a life of a man\nWho has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her\nI didn't really make for a while I said as the person that we're talking about didn't know the air and the time the place\nBut I think for and got before the Senate and and that clip the worst moment and she said when the two boys who laughed at life and and then I watched him in a car and thousands of people were laughing at how\nThey can do and say I I Will tell you the way [noise]\nNow justice Kevin always treated him\nHas become a big factor\nIntimate terms I mean he he knew addresses\nIt head on now ... what do you make of that explanation of his comments about Dr Ford he he's he's making the point the cabinet was treated so horrifically and incidentally Dr Ford was treated terribly too oh she wanted was anonymity\nAll she wanted was confidentiality she figured she can figure she thought she had a way to try to stop\nBrett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court in her own way on her own terms none of that happened because the Democrats leapt her name and her story to the media and it was out there for all the world to see\nAnd then of course President Trump said to Leslie stall he repeated a on a message to the game on the gives on the stump all the time\nAnd frankly it makes people hate him cringe\nIt makes those of us who support him we have a we have a real knowing understanding of why he says that he says this off and on the president I got here in other words I Won and they lost just cut number six from his shut down last night on sixty minutes with CBS is Leslie stall cuts six\nHow you doing it for good how are you\nOh All right All right I'll tell you what ... what what nobody is not saying the reason the liberals are the Democrats are scared of Trump it because he's given power back to the people he's given money\nBack to the people because the more folks that have money the less they need to Democrats want to keep you want to do with my coat tails and all\nOf that and that's that's ... ...
