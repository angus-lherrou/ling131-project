moment to make money\nToday called eight seven seven four dead for one one or visit fatherhood dad gummed\n... by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the and [noise]\nAmerican culture and politics is my comment\nAnd I know there are a great day in his greatest nation on God's green earth a great day when one of the great dividing lines in the United states is not only the dividing line between liberals and conservatives between people who think that Donald Trump can do no wrong\nAnd those who think he can do no right there is also in a binding dividing line\nThat continues to be a painful reminder of some of the more troubling aspects of Americans passage the dividing line according to race\nBetween black and white or or you can save between black people\nOf at a unique experience in the United states coming here originally as enslaved individuals and uh everybody else\nAnd uh there is a new book on this subject by someone who was in the past is very very critical of black leadership his name is Juan Williams\nYou see him on the five very regularly on Fox News he's a regular contributor to Fox News his new book is called what the hell do you have to lose\nWhich of course there's a line from President Trump and the subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights a won congratulations on the book\nThat's wonderful and I appreciate you having me on because micro versus you know I think are intriguing topic it's a rich topic but especially for conservative audiences sometimes a very difficult you know kind of prickly issue uh but I think it's so important that's why I appreciate the opportunity\nWell one of the things that I liked about your book is you give proper credit or to the Republican Party in particular to Senate minority leader at the time Everett Dirksen for the landmark civil rights bill well let's let's start there because one of the things you remind people of is how profoundly\nThat civil rights bill that was passed a with very strong Republican support in Nineteen sixty four changed America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act that fixed before so that you know we'd go through everything housing education voting rights are and you come to the idea that this would not have passed unless you had Everett Dirksen\nWho came from southern Illinois an all white pretty much district or it peek in Illinois was sundown time where if you were a person of color you are not welcome there after sundown better get yourself out of there there's going to be trouble\nUm and you know you ask about family I think in these terms my father who was born Nineteen oh to Michael standing on a corner\nAnd you would say that man's life\nIs really dictated by his skin color in terms of his educational opportunities employment opportunities where he can live where you can buy a house where you can rent an apartment all of this dictated by skin color and then you come to me I'm sixty four is born Nineteen fifty for Michael\nAnd uh it's just an incredibly different world live I live in a world where\nJeff what you know I've seen not only the first black secretary of state the first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff I've seen the first black\nBillionaire you know people like Oprah Winfrey Bob Johnson or I can go on the record number of blacks and Congress black mayors this we are black senators it's a you know I\nI joke in there that you know my dad if he was aware of my daughter and you and I felt bad my daughter has a Georgetown Law degree\nHe played with Georgetown Law doesn't accept by people well that was true to the sixties but she does\nToday and of course I could say hey bad you know look at me here I Am having lunch at the White House and you throw it who's the other black guy and I thought oh that's the president Ronald bombing that you don't live in a different world you live in a different universe Advil for his men this progress made in this country\nPresident Trump has invited to the White House no okay would you go if he did no\nSee I don't get that I just in the end of the same thing with with some of the um in other words it like you I I Want President Trump I Want Republicans generally to\nUh be a more broad based party not just to be the party of older white guys are to be a party and reaches out to everybody because otherwise we have no future\nAnd uh so why why if the president invited you would you not go to the White House\nWhere I think he's insulting condescending and and so lacking in any sensitivity or knowledge of how American history you know the central to American history has the story of black history\nSo when he says things like calling a black woman Omarosa a dog or calling another black woman a congresswoman Maxine Waters who is a tremendous Trump critic but he says extraordinarily low IQ when he engages in politically\nOr you know advantageous tactics I guess with his base like playing the first black president wasn't born in this country and then he uses that\nTo elevate his profile I think this man is just about the biting the country about beating people racial hate and I'm not going to be in his company\n[noise] okay [noise] ... when you say that ... ... you're you're now he's going to be ... you don't expect that he is going to be removed from office do you\nI don't know I mean I don't know what Mueller has in terms of the mall or pro if that's what you're talking about\nYou know I'm just talking generally he's going to be president for another two plus years two years three months\nAnd um [noise] okay during that time period\nAnd and this is a part of the the challenge for your book and I let me back up for a moment because a lot of people may not know but one you wrote a courageous book the guts you lots and lots of attacks on the left it was a book called enough the subtitle is the phony leaders\nDead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black America\nAnd what we can do about\nCorrect and one of the things you talked about was having um black leadership and talk more about achievement and a little less of a constant sense of grievance aren't aren't aren't you coming into that trap that that you yourself described in your book enough\nNo in fact I Wish that the president President Trump\nWould celebrate the idea of black achievement in this society instead of you know always talking about black people in the way he says oh you know they live in circumstances worse than Afghanistan their neighborhoods still with violence and poverty and joblessness and bad schools\nI'm thinking wait a second that's your description of black Americans twenty Eighteen\nI mean right now Michael forty percent of black Americans are in between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars an additional twelve percent between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nSo you can see a majority of black America is either in the middle class or beyond this is one of the prime achievements of the civil rights era in addition I say obviously the growth of black political voice in power as part of American society so these are tremendous achievements\nSo I'm all about looking at how people who were faced with such disadvantage and society slavery legal segregation ongoing racial bias and all the rest nonetheless\nHad thought out the American dream and have kept it alive and and want to fix the ... you know like the Jefferson slogan they want to move on up right\nAbsolutely good stuff but this president instead he focuses on the twenty percent\nWho who are in poverty disproportionately young people and kids often times because of broken families on the like and he makes that out to be the entirety of the black part like they're all gonna mug you are going to take your job or they're going to ruin your schools I think it is just so deceitful and dangerous because again it is racially divisive\nOkay I again I I ... some of the same uh comments by President Trump and gestures by President Trump I've been\nHighly critical of on this radio show a because I'm not one of those people who believe that President Trump can do nothing right uh nothing I'm ... and but I also I'm\nA believer not one of those people things President Trump can do nothing wrong and I'm not one of those people things you can do nothing right\nAnd he must be doing something right because we covered on the air before\nThey're a bunch of polls and it's not just ... and there are six major polls that show that his approval rating in the black community has been going up\nAnd largely that's because we do have a black unemployment rate that is the lowest ever measured that people have been making the kind continuing the kind of economic progress that you're talking about right\nBy what I Am saying is let's not be in their fight to the idea that if you look at the white middle class in this country are so much of it was built behind things like the G. I. bill behind things like the un aid to mortgages so that people could buy homes in this country and don't forget\nAgain G. I. bill job training educational opportunity after World War two and that was often done again on a segregated basis\nSo I mean government has a role to play but that's not going to be it seems to me the be all and end all in terms of economic empowerment it struck that you don't punish people on the earlier\nAnd I I think I think every ... every poll people have good well should certainly agree on that and speaking of people of goodwill you played a courageous role during the Clarence Thomas confirmation fight in in defense of Justice Thomas and and I know you were a supporter of his confirmation\nI'd do you think that history is repeating itself to some extent in terms of the the kind of attacks that have been ... level the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee and the comics case it was a need a hill and\nYou know we were very slow to come out but then there are many of the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they just messed that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leak and then it came out so it's very similar because if you look at for after four she found a letter to a congressman ash to make the way to Dianne Feinstein\nI met her name is ... or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... what\n... thinks they're more to me is a level that charge I don't think that anybody that ah you know Clarence Thomas ... on a better\nYeah but my one there's a difference of cuts and the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do when he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission was a government official and he was already a law graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh has to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYou are but I think that the larger issue here is ... or a character for someone who is going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because you know the whole presentation of himself as a bird during a choir boy these are a bookish people and then people experience like this guy was a big grin and he loved the parties don't\nCount okay wait a minute if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really monitor for ... Washington D. C. becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen but in any event but one um would you vote for ... confirmation\nNo not at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as a hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off he was\nMaking all sorts of projects undergrad Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats are I'm thinking wait a minute you're ... you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're just displaying a tremendous lack with an event or\nDon't you think given given the amount of money that was spent by George Soros and other than it is well known as it's now come out that the those two women who cornered Jeff Flake and the elevator but we're actually operatives in this open society project which is a Soros project or sometimes they\nCan can you well I unfortunately I think we are out of time of the book doesn't have anything\nTo do is Brett Kavanaugh but of course\nAt the moment that is it an issue that seems to touch almost everything the book is called what the hell do you have to lose its cause subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights Juan Williams of Fox News always appreciate talking

press secretary\nIn any event he was taking on Sarah Sanders about the fact that President Trump last night uh pointed out in a rally\nOr the and pointed out fairly accurately some of the inconsistencies and Christine Blasey Ford's memory the fact that she remembered exactly that she had one beer\nThat night but she couldn't remember which house it was or what year it was as she couldn't remember how she got home after this a legit incident happened which is a big thing that Rachel Mitchell emphasizes in her ... she was the prosecutor who asked the questions of her and actually set them up pretty effectively when you read this memo\nIn any of that here was Sarah Sanders and give them a pasta or about that to President Trump's comments\nSince there's something wrong with the president of the United states mocking somebody's shoes sexually assault seemed\nTo me that he was stating facts that Dr Ford herself a laid out in her testimony once again I every single word that judge Kavanaugh said has been looked at exam and picked apart by most of you in this room but not a new one is looking at\nAh whether or not the accusations Nader corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them\nUnder so you're just doing all the\nI think both Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh ah or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely disgraceful\nWhat they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford there exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusation this isn't the process that should've been done is certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh's and that shouldn't be part of this process and the facts\nHave to be looked at and I think you have to look at the

unusual that the FBI was not going to be interviewing Ford they were not going to be interviewing Christine Blasey Ford they're not going to be interviewing a judge Kavanaugh again\nI mean after all each of them spent hours\nIn front of the Senate Judiciary committee plus they have both been extensively interviewed by the staff of the Judiciary Committee apparently the um and and this by the way I think is a syndicated that judge Kavanaugh\nSpent more hours over thirty total speaking to the staff of the Judiciary Committee than any other nominee\nFor the Supreme Court or for all of the others combined and with more questions asked I\nThink it's safe to say that he is the the first nominee where where his drinking\nIn a high school and college has become a serious issue by the way that was not the subject of the the um FBI\nBackground investigation apparently they are speaking to Deborah Ramirez who had made those comments about his freshman year at Yale in the basement of Lawrence hall\nAnd ensure [noise] let let me speak personally for just a moment because as people know listen to the show I went to Yale once upon a time\nAnd uh I did my first year of the law school and so this was before a judge Kavanaugh or was anywhere close to the campus in New haven\nBut I ... at places like that are very tradition bound the culture doesn't change that dramatically\nAnd is it the idea that drinking is a very big deal for a lot of people in college I think that's true I mean breaking news and once they're their own jails songs\nIncluding the ... song which is very well known it became a smash hit\nAre all about drinking\nThere are there there are lots of ah lots of references and this goes back to songs dating to the nineteenth century\nAnd I I Will say that does that mean that everybody gets drunk all the time no I I I was thinking about it and I\nI didn't drink in college sorry\nUm I Wish I could say I didn't look I turned out okay and where at least I think I did um but no I um I I did not imbibe I didn't like the taste of beer at that time and a and most of the people that I knew\n[noise] sort of and I've read about this and right turns when I talk a little bit about my years ago and part of what happened is in the late sixties\nThere was a transition and people who had been very obsessed with beer became very\nObsessed with pot which I thought was more obnoxious\nI mean really more obnoxious because people made a ... a religious thing of it with their flashing strobe ... oh man oh wow this is so amazing\nAnd I I don't really think that anybody know not Brett Kavanaugh or not members of the ... not not anybody or had the idea that drinking beer was a path to light and\nUh I Know I don't think that was the case so maybe at the University of North Carolina they've just published and this is part of the very needed role of a free press there's a website That's published some photos including photos of Christine Blasey Ford\nDuring her years at Chapel Hill and University of North Carolina\nAnd showing her as something of a party girl there is a statement discovered now in the New York times today the New York times not just Fox News it's the New York times is covering the allegations by her former live in boyfriend\nWho says that all of this stuff about how she was traumatized\nThey were dating for ... years they knew each other casualty averse to they were dating for six years between Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he says a number of unpleasant things abound a Dr Blass the Ford now is that off limits well he's do ...\nQuestioning her credibility for instance on the stuff that she was afraid of flying and that's why she couldn't make it to the hearings to testify earlier when it was very obvious to everybody that this is nonsense date they asked her\nRitual Miller asked her about her flying and she said oh no I'm not really afraid of flying so why did you tell that to the committee and doesn't this go to the issue of credibility\nI owe all of this stuff it seems to me that if you are going to come forward\nAbout something that happened too long ago from what you feel you have never ever ever recovered\nWell do you have to expect that there will be some pushback and um [noise] the with the way the New York times highlights their story ah Christine Blasey Ford's credibility under new attack by Senate Republicans\nBut ah it includes the following the former boyfriend told the Judiciary Committee that she witnessed personally Dr Blass Z helping a friend repair for a possible polygraph examination contradicting her testimony under oath\nDr Blass he a psychology professor from California who also goes by are married name Ford was asked during the hearing whether she'd ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test she answered never\nBut the former boyfriend whose name was redacted from a copy of a sworn statement provided\nTo the Judiciary Committee\nSaid that when they were together in the late Nineteen Ninety she saw Dr Blass to use her understanding of psychology\nTo assist her roommate of the time Monica el McLean before interviews for possible position positions with the FBI or the U.S attorney's office that might require her to take a lie detector test\nQuote I witnessed Dr Ford helped Micheline prepare for a potential polygraph exam demands and the statement Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs worked and help me clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nUm\n... what you hear again and again and again everywhere is that\nSomehow Brett Kavanaugh should be disqualified because of the tone of his testimony that the one thing I I Want you to knows that virtually everyone in this montage\nAds everyone in this montage was opposed to him before his testimony there were opposed him before anyone heard of Christ\nIn ... Ford they aren't opposed to him because of his testimony they are opposed to him\nBecause of his allegations against him of a sexual assault they're opposed to him because he has a constitutional is conservative listen\nAt exchanges with higher Feinstein was that are close our with others that I thought one of our lives [noise] um he was clearly a poet Trent uh aggressive angry\nMade you wonder about is should've building\nIn my case yes to me it was to have you that was not a suitable for a person who would be a judge on any court much less the Supreme Court I think when\nA judge Kavanaugh with all partisan a left wing conspiracy beyond everything I think that was the disqualifying moment Jordan show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing\nHe was angry with Rand thinking it was an ... I was astonished of his his Iran I mean he's a judge who's a sitting\nCircuit court judge is supposed to be nonpartisan that part is enraged not the most fun judicial thing you can do anything as soon as he were unfairly to these still supposed to behave as a judge his other than an atom is should be disqualifying showed no judicial temperament\nBut we know one thing he does not had the temperament to be a job\nFor the Supreme Court I've never argued a part of the Supreme Court but I've written amicus brief and I said I've sat in the Supreme Court\nHow can he credibly on the court and claimed to be impartial with temperamental like [noise]\nPainting belligerent pain and full of ... on the table that looks like it's going up the night it's faith Supreme Court justice he showed a lack of judicial temperament\nThat I wouldn't want my case to be her invite them I don't think anyone in America for public in a Democrat we'd want someone as biased and its uncontrolled in his range I didn't even ask range\nTemperament is just so I think he's going to be resentful [noise] I think that out of everything we can talk about the FBI investigation but even if they clear I think that teen telephone cell phone to a whole\nThey can't come out of and be a responsible journalists on the Supreme Court without angering Henry okay\nBut by the way let let me mention the name here the name is Justice Clarence Thomas or just as high as Thomas was also angry\nWhen he testified before the Senate Judiciary committee back in Nineteen Ninety One remember he accused them of a high tech lynching\nAnd he was angry and he was right to be angry\nAnd I think Brett Kavanaugh's right to be angry this what Orrin Hatch wrote today it's a terrific piece\nHe says we're starting to see arguments like the following even if judge Kavanaugh is innocent what he said of the hearing and how we said it is just qualifying this is rich says Senator Hatch\nTheory and current and the first place only because of democratic do publicity\nThat occur only because Senate Democrats sat on ms Ford's allegations for six weeks rather than referring them to the committee investigators as they should have done immediately it occurred only because ms Ford's lawyer's\nRecommended to ms for by Senate Democrats refused to tell their own client of our invitation to testify privately in California as she said she preferred\nThe judge cap Kavanaugh had the temerity to defend themselves vigorously is now being counted as a strike against him\nI think for many Americans is to his credit we will be right back [noise]\n\n\nAnd do you have what it takes to be nine sixty the patriots Tom shot time they'll find out millions exceeded patriot in Scottsdale gun club resist the third annual top shots shooting competition Sunday October\n... issue in the top shot this whole series tournament\nFrom best score down to a bracket style finally someone is walking away with a one thousand dollar prize and the title of drop shots just in\nTime shot dead even accuracy shooting bowling pin this competitive fun competition\nHas something for everyone from\nExperience shooters to another all of us will receive adoption ... bags as well as loads of gifts for shooters here's your chance and one thousand dollars for free Scottsdale gun club membership and more sign up today at nine sixty the patriots dot com for top shot Sunday October ... competition details on\nRegistration at nine sixty though patriot dot com sponsored by more injury\nLaw [laughter] suggesting I was playing video games\nCool running ...\nFrancois queens I'll like and I like playing in the virtual train right in front of me or electronic orange world so what did you do well my parents that\nWe could have forced the real force\n... running down this was an actual path\nI saw this in real life rod it was all like ... and I saw an hour to the plate and it's amazing\nScene with water around my [noise] like white water than\nMe and my sister and my parents sat around a campfire and told stories all night last oh that's pretty cool to\nThis weekend was getting closer to nature can get you closer to your family and the four years to go to discover the forest U.S Forest service and the\nTake an ordinary potty knife and scrape off the old wax ring place the new X. ring over the flinch in line up to ... with a bowl and gently sitting in place making sure a proper seal is created without Flanders drain next um\nA sweetie\n...\nOh I'm yeah [laughter] yeah I mean you really need to get to know ... right on do do you want me to stop\nAround and why are you OK\nTightened up ... line up the flushing vows to the opening in the top of the bowl and secure the tank with a screwdriver and\nGrasses\nAnd the smallest no one's going to have the biggest impact on a child's life will take time to be a bad today goalie seven seven for dad bought one way or the Brotherhood ... by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the ...

they will make it easy for you to do your part in this election help guide you to wear your commitment can matter most to go to the tax cuts work dot com and get involved this November it's a faithful unimportant decision\nThe um White House sources say that the\nAnd Michael it's great to be with you absolutely not that's the thing in our culture today these religious liberties that we have had for over two hundred and forty years in this country they're simply not exercise to every student has the right to bring a Bible to school if they wish to read it during lunchtime and free time\nNot during class time where it's disruptive\nBut you can do that and it's completely legal and in fact we provide a one sheet illegal statement for teachers and administrators who invariably come to the student on this day bring your Bible to school now say hey it's illegal for you to have that you're giving your Bible we've had teachers confiscate buy\nInto the student shows that once she legal brief and they read it and go oh okay it looks like it is legal here's your Bible back it's almost like this ah hadn't the same kind of environment where we don't understand our religious celebrities in this country any more\nI yeah and what's strange sheer as I'm sure a lot of the people on the left to say oh it's terrible to bring a Bible to school would absolutely defend any child who wanted to bring a Koran to school for or wanted to bring the communist manifesto whatever they want to bring\nRight absolutely and we get that question often why why don't you champion that we're we're Christian ministry we champion bringing the Bible the Old Testament New Testament to schools for Christian kids to read on their own or with others and invariably this as a lunch setting typically we're a little Thirteen fourteen year old girl or boy\nHas four or five friends around the table and they're reading the book uh John or something from the Old Testament it's completely right I mean you think of Michael but for what for frustrate you think of the impact of the Bible on western civilization\nAnd here in this country people are wrongly saying teachers school administrators wrongly saying hey what are you doing with that that's illegal here that sounds like something from the old Soviet Union\nNo no it does entirely and see what what I uh I I see from the materials that you prepared for this you\nAre emphasizing for kids they shouldn't be brandishing the bibles in front of people and saying unless you read this book with me you're going to go to hell or or I I hate you unless you come in and joined me and my face I you you're also emphasizing the kids who bring their bibles to school to\nTry to bear witness you know winning and kind and a friendly way\nAbsolutely I mean one of the things I often ask friends who you know have difficulty believing in who Jesus was I say you know what what's missing in his resume he was a person who exposed\nReally espouse love joy piece goodness kindness mercy and those are the value of traits that we like to teach the kids to express to their friends and two people at the school that they bring their Bible to one of the great stories last year we had a girl who was a little shy little embarrassed to do this but she did it\nAnd to her surprise all twenty eight kids in her classroom at a public school all brought bibles but they didn't even know each other we're Christians but the whole class was\nAnd she was astounded and that's the kind of thing we're hearing across the country that\nYou know three or four or five or even the whole class will end up bringing their Bible to school and they're going wow we never knew and I think Michael part of the problem here in our culture today for the left and the progressive suit talk about the you know the harm of shaming which is good that's a good message\nThey sure do a lot of shaming for people of faith to the point where these kids are embarrassed or feel they can't bring their Bible to school or talk about God\nAnd that's not a good in that environment for us to be an today everybody should bring their ideas their thoughts their opinions and their faith into the public square\nAnd again it can only enrich a at the exchange of ideas which is supposed to be part of education I take a gym daily a focus of the family you would have no objection if some other kids on bringing the Bible to school day which is tomorrow\nOr if some kids wanted to bring in all up ... Christopher Hitchens' book God is not great or some other atheist quote classic effect and child one of the counter bring the Bible to school day\nWith that kind of book you'd have no objection to that would you\nStop course not that people should you know go and work on their own thing but for us we appreciate the fact that over five hundred thousand kids last year\nDid bring their Bible to school on that first day of arc that first Thursday of of October and it's great you know ... rama manual for example I made that comment a few weeks ago saying I Know it's politically incorrect but what we need and in our public square is more faith and family\nWe could ... or I'm a manual send him one way to do and you know what I'm saying and marriage you know America into\nI'm saying okay here's one way to do it let's let kits and encourage kids to participate and bring your Bible to school and that's that's one way kids can be proud of those attributes those moral convictions that are good for our nation there's nothing to be fearful\nAbout people who want to love their neighbor\nAnd one would hope not um how did you pick October has the time to do this\nYou know it was just that there's so many special days going on now that was a day but it was available it's easy to remember the first Thursday of October every year and again this is our fifth year of doing it started with eight thousand kids or the next year was a hundred and two fifty two hundred fifty thousand in last year five hundred and fifty two thousand so\nWe are grateful for the participation and people can go to the bring your Bible dot org website we have lots of assist\nA sheets there that even the legal assistant sheet that they could print off so they can take to school that day and there's information for teachers for parents for everybody to better understand what bring your Bible is all about\nWell I I think it's terrific and congratulations on it and help people find out more about it I like the fact that it's in October coming this year right after the Jewish high holy days and the whole holiday season\nUh we're supposed to be gaining perspective and that's the idea though to bring your Bible website and you can find out much more about it we will be right back\nInto my home eventually [noise]\n\nI'm so mocking here all my work you know one of the biggest outrageous I reported on the

for the Supreme Court of the United states will get that resolution God willing before we go into the weekend and there is one thing that\nI Do want to put out there for every day\nOr every yes and we're going to be talking a little bit about this a new attack on President Trump will get a response on that\nThe new attack which is really an old attack about\nPresident from dodging taxes and he isn't really a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well researched and the New York times so what is the relevance of this right now\nIt's obviously an attempt to tilt the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore a advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that and about the progress on trade\nWhere there's been great progress in the markets love it we've had this week the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing\nUm why is that happening we'll talk with us Steven more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox News\nHe has a new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward President Trump\nBut the question for Juan Williams will be what about the evidence and there's lots of it that there is at least an increasing open mindedness to the Republican message from African Americans we will get to that as well on the med show but first\nI just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective as as people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season\nAnd actually\nI Want to thank Mark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job and are helping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is a a basically it's almost a month long um one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful\nThis one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York um and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family and began things\nBut also because on this whole Kavanaugh matter I I was able to see a little bit of perspective and let me just tell you something that happened which I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue\nAnd a a and normally I talked to my friends I I was approached by a little kid and when I say a little kid and ten eleven years old\nAnd um [noise] it ... ... he asked me I I'm not even sure who we was it you know as with the courage to a hundred people there and [noise] anyway so the kid comes up to me\nAnd he says I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice and somebody a Thirty Years' ago\nWhite lines that a big deal and I had\nNot yet seen the story about the alleged a bar fight and one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale and then I later in the horrors of ice throwing\nAnd somehow it this is now reaching ... kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is\nA is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that it's okay to throw Weiss or not\nThat it's okay to be under age in a bar find them cetera et cetera and no one ah was damaged or charged or arrested in this a bar if they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay this\nWhole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and girls in campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing is powerfully helping Republicans\nAnd I believe for one very simple reason if you like everything we've gone through\nWith Kevin on four in the back in the forest and the punching and the pushing the nastiness\nAnd then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm a Kavanaugh was\nNot arrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up a bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw ice\nAnd a ... again I think it's more relevant than the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement I mean it was anything is more relevant than the idea that Brett Kavanaugh and money was at Yale\nI'm I\nWas a member of a hard drinking fraternity ... the whole idea that this is significant and that is worthy of our attention this is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail of people's task to try to smear them and destroying them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat then sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you will get in fact a Gerald nab blur\nThe radical from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already talked about impeaching justice Kavanaugh after he is confirmed\nIf you think that's where politics should go then first of all tell me why secondly if you are almost sure to vote Democrat anyway if you\nDo want to change if you are in politics that is a little bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more about results rather than just destroying\nThe enemy and results for the American people more days where the stock market is is up more days where people are working where people get raises\nI mean across the board it's happening now and ah and meanwhile\nWhat what's the focus of the focus is on on President\nTrump not mocking but daring to question a Christine Blasey Ford and he did it at a\nRally last night and President Trump is on button and rallies and they'll just wasn't on his speech but first of all of people say well he ... he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony here was the president of the United states and what he had to say\nI [noise] right [noise]\nWell do you think it was it was one of them are good [noise] how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember I don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know\nHow much I don't know [noise]\n\nAnd I'm In my life has shattered\nOkay um [noise] look at ... is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do it didn't do it but is it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question judge Kavanaugh\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the I'm Sarah Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this is the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about Christine Blasey Ford and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders\nAnd the way they're so disrespectful of president and I don't have a problem and Michael are you know a someone from media asking the president of the question that's why we have to be asked that the president of question but it's not the tough questions their manners and make just trip\nWith contempt and he started out that press conference by saying okay first question was what Kevin I said look I'll take care of a lot of questions but we're here right now to talk of the\nYou know the trade deal so are there any questions about the trade deal and he took a nap or we're talking about the trip you up and I'll take questions upcoming next person resurrect what Kevin uh ... what about camera or you I was just outrageous and and uh\nAnd it just bothers me let's treat the price of the United states with respect them some dignity I mean he deserves it and I look I didn't always agree with what black Obama backed I disagree with most of the things he did but every time I saw him I was always sure Mr ...\nAnd it just isn't happening there\nAnd I and I think most
