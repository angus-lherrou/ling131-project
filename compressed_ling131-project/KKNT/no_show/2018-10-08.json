[laughter] I just am interested in telling you the sad truth ... you're not going to hear that outside of this show or my book on happiness that happiness is a moral virtue\nYou know who knew what the

so I think that I got a disproportionately high number who said yeah I can read person then I said okay how do you write a capital by\n[laughter] and\nI didn't get a very positive response\nToday's subject is indeed extremely important that this could change your life I'm like I'm not kidding\n\nVery very very very\nFew people have a good in every area of life\nAnd I mean every important area flex let me give you a list right a list of\nAm if I missed that meat I Would ask the two gentlemen with whom I work to come up with something that I missed All right now I'm by the way this is not an order of importance it solely an order of their appearance in my brain actually in my in my mind so for example health\nChildren parents spouse but north marriage work\n\nRight how many people can say that in all of those areas of life they have been the recipient of great happiness\nThe answer is very few\nI was with somebody who has a spectacular life spectacular children in great health\nAnd a fair marriage a fair marriage not a bad marriage at all not a particularly good marriage\nAnd this person I couldn't even say male or female this person or did I say great career as well do I mentioned that I don't think so children career health\nTerrific marriage fair\nAnd the answer is with the person like a better marriage absolutely is the person basically happy you absolutely\nBecause you have to find happiness where you can that's the lesson of today's happiness our and very few people find it in all major Remus\n\nAll right that's that's you ... you don't like your job okay you have a good marriage All right so be happy\n\nTo be the ability to have\nHappiness supplied as it were by every major avenue\nIs a rare warm for most people want any Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nIs the number if you take this seriously you can have a happier life\nIt just it just doesn't work out for everybody\nEvery major area they happiness producer so your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work and being happy\nAm I to me that's more amazing that people are working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's that Maliki is\n\nYou know if people do X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it because I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for very few people those life deliver in all ...\nOf life that's that's key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't good so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about and ... not worthy of divorce\nUnderstands that there are other avenues oh what's skews me I Can't believe it I Can't believe I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've the punishment room is only earned for carelessness not for content but I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content to the should apply anyway friends\nHow am I forget that one\nSo friends health marriage I said parents I ah I Know of course children I Know but I I'm thinking I it's the one includes parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life is all put parents and\nSo parents children friend's health work marriage there you go\nIf you got him on all cylinders that I mean that's like having an all wheel drive\nAnd\nBe and I was thinking of a brand name but I don't want to push any particular brand name here but you know what I mean I mean in all wheel drive super luxury s._u._v.\n\nFind happiness where you can okay that's the point instead of concentrating on where you don't have it All right everybody and let's go to your calls one eight Prager seven seven and six\nAnd Julie in Chicago I've been waiting for Julie for many years Hi Julie\n[laughter] feeling is mutual so thank you I think you can let your taking my call on my question to you is um [noise]\nAnd they're married and trying to improve the areas of your life that you don't that don't bring you happiness as opposed to accepting a status quo and and you sort of credit and looking for happiness\nBut it's a wonderful question I my my my answer would be that what you do both you you are you can't in other words you can't wait until that's a success\nFor you to be happy you can say oh when I fix this I'll be happy you have to be happy wall fixing so I Want you to fix if you can\nIf one of those areas or two or three of those areas are or not sources of happiness I Would love you to pursue those areas but you can't the for being happy until those those successfully accomplished\nSo that makes sense\nAbsolutely very good answer I think it [laughter]\nOh You're welcome thank you that's the best question answer good\nTonight uh I like that but\nWhat if you do this is from triple the water if you do with the other person in your life fails to realize this can you be happy with someone who doesn't realize as he told me about a a a a love interest you talking about a friend is well\nI Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say your other spouse that isn't on board in these matters has twice said then you still have the\n... health friend's children parents or work I'm remember or not and or to be sources of happiness\nThis is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important is this\nAnd you can't that's what Julie's question was so important you can't pay this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I moved to ah to Baltimore oh well it was a bad choice I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding they'll be offended okay\nWhen I get married ...

became happy in high school but before that I I was not happy so in fact if I didn't have all of the pain that I've had I don't think I could do happiness so in ... the question has merit\nI think if

calls immediately Matty in Houston, Texas Hi Maddie Dennis Prager\nHow high\nThey might not really\nWell congratulations that is very exciting I'm very I'm happy that you're excited\nFor\nSo many go go\nDo I have advice for you that is precious I could spend the next hour giving you advice [laughter] [noise] uh yes I Do so ah yeah here goes I'm just putting you on hold there\n[noise] so what the what does it\nMean to be a bar or ... ... is the Hebrew word for commandment it's translated often is good deed and many commandments are good deeds but it means commandment so let's take that seriously the notion in Judaism is that a\nGirl at twelve or a boy at Thirteen\nIs now responsible\nFor their own sins until now you did bad it was on your parents' record now it's on your record\nWild one should be excited at their bar mitzvahed one should be a little afraid to because now there is no protective shield between you and your morals record before God\nYou can't blame your parents as of tomorrow in fact parents say a prayer thanking\nGod that they are now freed from from the moral record of their children I take that very seriously took it seriously when I was your age I took it seriously as as the parent of two books two boys who had permits\nSo this is a spectacular notion I Am now responsible for my life it's the matter is the opposite of what is taught in America today to so many kids are not responsible for my life others are\nSo that's that's a big one that you now take control of your moral life\nAnd does that make sense\nOh poor\nOkay thank you that's that's precious I'll give you another one the the on the work commandment do right I've said this often the biggest difference between my religious and I think Christians religious education and secular education in America today is this\nI was raised they'll give you two differences I was raised obligation oriented kids today are raised rights oriented are you going to make a better human being whose preoccupied with his or her rights or his or her obligations\nI didn't hear the word rights 'til I got to college\nI ... I knew the word obligations throughout throughout my life oh by the way they give you a real power for example the uh uh Judaism and Christianity believe that the husband and wife have sexual obligations to the to their spouse\nYou say that today you're accused of advocating marital rape Huffington Post just accused me of marital rape second time I've been accused at least that I Know of I'm sure doesn't know that this doesn't times but I mean the big places because I wrote an article ten years ago\nAnd we try and proud of and people should read it\nSaying that given the ... the importance of sex to a marriage if you love your husband\nAnd he loves you and he's a good man don't let mood alone determine whether you will have sex with him sometimes just habit because you love that's called marital rape today\nThat I Believe that there are obligations I have obligations to my wife ... in in a whole host of the barriers and she has obligations to me in a whole host of area\nThe other difference between a religious education and the secular education I was taught that the greatest problem in Venice predators life is Dennis prayer that is a religious school Christian school Jewish school\nThe biggest issue when your life is you know\nSecular school biggest issue in life is American society sexism racism is even a phobia phobia et cetera big difference say so those are my areas for ... good luck\nWouldn't it be fun if I showed up just flew to Houston and showed up\nI just you have no idea that there was a part of me that would love to do that [laughter] I don't know if the rabbi would be happy [laughter] [laughter] uh ... let's see uh Andrew in Fort Worth Hi\nI'm almost ...\nVery well thank you\nFor the quick guy for you and would you rather be feared or respected and why\nIt depends by whom\nYeah actually I don't mean by fear\nAs when I go and like I fear consequences for um ... my parents or my spouse\nI rather that America be feared than anything else so it is there were times where respected I think that the I think if my children had no fear of me it wouldn't have been good\nThat but today at their ages in their twenties and thirties I don't I don't want them to fear me I don't I don't think that's that would be a good thing\nI Want them to respect me and love me but uh when they're when they're eight I Would like them to fear me you'll like this Andrew I asked if I did an hour once\nIf you didn't do drugs when you were in high school or college or or say high school why not\nThe biggest the most common answer was because my mother

Friday I got a crush of all when you think the earth and\nWhat is it I think four point six billion years and the universe is what fourteen point something billion that's what I think\nThat's one of the allergies begin so you can only believe that the earth\nIs a few thousand years old if you take literally that each of the creation base is twenty four hours but the sun has not created for days how can you have a day without the sun also the word human Hebrew\nWhich has that worked for a day is used in so many context for example genesis to five and says this is the creation of the world in the day that God created the heavens\nEra so clearly day doesn't mean one day also got calls light day and dark night\nSo God himself uses the term Yom in in a different way than the twenty four hour a day so there's there's just no I'll listen I don't have an argument I said that to the earlier caller I Believe it's billions of years old\nBut if somebody says it's a few thousand years old they they don't bother me\nThey they don't hurt the society for that belief they still give their kids to a polio shots\nAnd measles shots\nTheyre not anti science\nSo uh that's that's the I I don't it's not an argument that I feel is critical I Believe I Believe that the first five books or indeed divide and that God is in the rest of the Bible\nBut I don't believe that it is it is a a battle worth fighting over the literal ... of the days of the six days of creation\nAnd a A R title my work on the Bible the rational Bible and I try to be true to the title reason tells me that it's billions of years old\nIt is not one ... less a miracle if God created the universe in six days or in six billion years ... what what is the difference\nAnd by the way the Bible itself says in ... a day in ... a day in God's eyes just like three thousand is like a thousand years\nOkay thank you my friend I really appreciate it mean to win semi Valley California you're the first mango I have ever spoken

we got listeners joking that the president said Airforce one for everybody to Washington and you know a lot of them all up have a big party\nWell listen ... we're we're having a party philosophically about the jobs numbers and and of course job creators network has been such an integral part\nOf the tax cuts the good news today the loser ... announced the U.S jobless rate dropped a three point seven percent gets it that's the lowest it's been nearly fifty years Elaine\nSuch great news you guys have got to be bouncing off the walls with the job that the job creators network has played with the these tax cuts in with this great news about jobs jobs jobs in America\nFor like a real winters here are the thirty million small business owners that continue to thrive under the economy and the program but how is that the administration earlier this week I had an op ed on real clear politics\nWhich actually get in on how women are ... under the carnival and we're seeing more when and start businesses and re enter the workforce a new outside with a mom you know historically childcare has has acted as a barrier for women and uh what the workforce and entrepreneurship and\nI'm now they're a benefit of the tax cuts in job that you know not only have we reduce tax rates across the board for everyone but we also doubled the child tax credit and that's an adoption and that's an absolute reduction off your tax\nBill ... here at the lower end of the ... that ... there's a fourteen hundred dollar refund or tax credits that natural payout for stuff like that in and in many cases that can help offset a lot of your child care costs huge than\nIt is indeed and and job creators network has been in the in the front line on the front lines of so many of these important issues I Know that you guys have put on your radar Amazon and and they're lobbying for a higher minimum wage of students some of these protests around the country\nAnd of course there's a real simple formula that's happening in ... for example in the service industry\nMcDonald's fast food they're they're being confronted with the demand for a higher minimum wage\nMcDonald's says you know what we're ... that that we're not going to make a profit were business to make a profit so you know we'll do five will replace all of these human beings with kiosks\nAnd we're seeing this all across the board where companies have to wisely invested in technology and and you know robots an automated systems and kiosks because when you're demanding Fifteen Eighteen twenty bucks an hour it doesn't work Elaine\nLike and that is true faith or a bad thing and\nI think any company said has the right to pay their employees whatever they want and I applaud Amazon to wanting to pay their employees more money from where I draw the line is poor Larry but they said that they want to um help increase and work with legislators\nAnd lobby then to increase the federal minimum wage would hurt\nMany of our thirty million solve it is out there\nAnd only seen the impact of that in Haiti like wash your hands on the in the adult we want people that all these hours and the money that we have closed their doors\nYou know they just don't have the resources that kinda wage increase right\nYou're right and I'm Glad you guys are are are you you're on the case I Love what you're doing let's keep fighting tax cuts work dot com or one

four or five three great to have you here in the relief factor dot com studios as we are uh watching history unfold right before our very eyes Terry Europe Jared welcome aboard what do you think\nLike a guy from New Jersey and I I take it a little more of a historical sure how to compare this situation and the civil war thank God the only difference is that they're not showing anybody yet\nNot yet why don't you want to reality one of them tried on a baseball field in Virginia we remember\nYes absolutely but the reality is that every public Republicans need to understand when you have power and you don't you lose it and they were very well what if they don't you\nKnow there's this idea of a civil war is very real to millions and millions of Americans and that's fair um I've talked about this for years and I I remember being on the stage of ... of a few months ago\nWith a colleague who sort of rolled his eyes at the at the idea that we are in a cultural war we're in a war we're in a war for our nation so we're we're in we're in a battle over what\nHow we want our country to be what we want represented in this country what what are what our standards our values our laws are going to be this is a very big presumption here of guilt\n... until you can prove your innocence we have turned American um standards and values and mores honest here by the by the activism or the left and it's frightening you know and and\nI I'm so I I was reading about the Ellen DeGeneres announcing this week but she was a sexual assault survivor\nAnd you know that breaks my heart I think she I think she was a book by Sean correctly she was Fifteen and that's horrifying that that helped define and shape\nThat trauma that Rabin of innocence and and everybody is sympathetic and and an agonizing over such a horrible crime against an innocent defenseless child\nAnd we have had a robust conversation about women in the workplace being being abused and and treated terribly\nA powerful men but then this me to thing has extended into the cabinet process where allegations have been made from high school and early college that haven't been able to be cooperating and in this conversation about cabinet I keep hearing the left use that term\nYou get to speak my truth this is my truth\nAnd honestly at last one I wanted to find a caller who can help maybe somebody on the left and I don't mind I Would love to hear from you actually to explain to me what my truth means\nBecause my truth may not\nBe the truth and it seems very clear to me\nThat the pursuit should be but the truth\nAnd I I don't really understand that we can clear aligned Lance and see if we can get a caller who can help explain to me what it means when when when some of these um advocates and activists and voices say that Christine Blasey Ford gets to tell\nThe truth truth this is my truth this is her truth well here's the truth will ... is that\nIs that kind of a shuttle acknowledgement that it may not be the truth\nWhat if Christine Blasey Ford believes with all of her heart Brett Kavanaugh did it but he didn't so I'm just going through a hypothetical process what if what if it was another boy what if it was a memory that she has wrong\nIn the way she is recounting this some thirty six years later does that mean you can you can defend that truth that isn't the truth in other words it does hurt truth supersede\nThe truth I think about this as it applies to Brett Kavanaugh if that's the case\nThen a false fluids stands a man has ruined family is destroyed and reputation is shattered because truth isn't the truth hypothetically Tim says she can explain it to me how you doing Tim welcome to the gallery show\nThank you uh it it comes from the education system and the philosophy behind that education system and they worry on the philosophical axiom that perception is reality\nSo you have your perception of what happened is your reality which you and I know it's not true right as if somebody believes pillow\nOr or seems a pillow as wrong ticket and after Iraq you had a they quickly learned that perception is not clear\nThat that's an interesting way of looking at it so that's done but maybe you're right maybe the belief is your perception is reality therefore that stands and frankly\nTo most Americans that's wrong that's not a normal logical understandable process breaking now Mike Gallagher show\nAll right the Senate has voted fifty one forty nine to advance the cabin on nomination it was a fifty one to forty nine vote and a shockingly to some Lisa Murkowski\nVoted no it was believed that Lisa Murkowski\nCould be this was again considered one of the big swing votes one of the undecideds she voted no which of course signal she's going to be a no vote tomorrow is a full confirmation process however senators flake columns and mansion Joe mansion from West Virginia\nCame through and voted yes so you got a fifty one to forty nine vote if you were to lose some how
