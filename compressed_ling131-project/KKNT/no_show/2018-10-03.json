[noise] for a few will\nI Love the word ... put it thought you\nKnow why do I like the like ... you know go to school with a guy named Jack hence\n\nThe ultimate issues hours devoted to the belief that having a map is useless unless you know where you're going\nYou know exactly where you are but if you don't know where you're going it's useless so what is it all up out of the big issue that's why it's the ultimate issues hour after all so sometimes something in the news provokes\nA subject on the male female our or for that matter the happiness or or for that matter the ultimate issues that are not as the case today\nSo\nI guess it's ... it's a multi faceted question but it revolves around one issue and that is\nIf you are middle aged adults\nIs it important in assessing you how are you active in high school it's obviously based on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd that's the question you're how old is she exactly fifty four fifty three fifty four or whether you're so you're in you're almost mid fifties\nIf you let's let's let me put it this way if you had an important position in Europe business where your school and you had to be unanimous\nAgreement that man had led a remarkably good life as an adult lower words from the age of Twenty one\nSo for thirty five thirty four years whatever has been a remarkable human being contributor to his community a family man it's a churchgoer which to me means something to\nMany doesn't where do you then where do you pursue allegations of misconduct in high school\nThat's the question I wouldn't if I were hiring for ... are you a a I'm a\nI'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old\nThe where the proximity to high school is a few years I'm Talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody applies for a job at ... university\nIs unanimous wanna find human being family man community man this person has been and then uh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same chargers\nOkay I Would ignore them\nAnd it's clear what type of adult you would have been I Am I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school\nSo that's the question that's the it's in how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\nNot not not up to thirty twenty five but in high school\nOne ape Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow I don't have a I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy and high school and I let an anti cheating on tests campaign I was elected the graduating class president I I was a bird was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that you know things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think it's a possibility or in the case of birth capital but happen or not happen with the\n... they were kids in in high school who were uh near two wells and who ended up fantastic adults\n\nSo ... who cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act and high school I acted in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five that's a separate issue you you because you you want to form a good\nPerson as early as possible I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nWhat how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it matters that's the question\nWhat any Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nStuff big stuff that people have to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats hiring a person\nFor a an important position in their business who knew what a terrific person misses and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you uh you you Rob the candy store right that's pretty serious not not not simply\nNot simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner and and you rub it\nBut it is obvious she turns your life around it otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we will at no point to acknowledge\nThat you have turned your life around that is why religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity so rooted in the importance\nOf penance of forgiveness\nOf tissue vi in in the Hebrew of of return or that's repentance\nThat is this famous Hebrew statement that I'm a I'm I'm literally translated from the Hebrew where a penitentiary stands the most righteous person cannot stab\nYou were a higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turn that life around and it's been good the whole time\nThat's how that's how and and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people's sins and forgiveness\nAnd uh the uh Judaism holiest days the day of of of panic tense day of atonement Yom ... so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo uh I emphatically endorse the notion that when you are already in middle age and the flood a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd bribery where where's your coded cutting off line as well as elementary school right well you know elementary school well yeah that's what people said until recently about high school I Won a Prager seven seven six\n\nSeventh grade when does middle school start so six eighth\nGrade oh what is already six rate so they might say six seven eight and they said maybe\nYes [laughter]\nOh\nYes indeed my friends the ultimate issues our and based course on current events of Brett Kavanaugh all the question arises [noise] does it matter in assessing an adult who was had a sterling life [noise]\nAnd it remarkably good life in comparison to almost any other person\nDoesn't matter what happened in high school but the question would it matter to you and hiring somebody ever again I I Am very clear in my belief about this it says if it does it means there was no such thing\nAs being able to turn your life around\nNow if you were going to hire a guy at Twenty one and charges were made about Seventeen it's a different story that was four years earlier you don't know that the person is turned his or her life around because they didn't have a life to live there for years\nBut when they have thirty six years in a family and community and a sterling career well that should do it\nI mean how many people are drawn to them anymore and not many it's hard to be done to them and I went to I went to college with Don ... is a great guy Brian in Dallas texas Hi Dennis Prager\nThank you so much for hearing form and listen to use for many years and although you don't know about ... university it's unbelievable my favorite are your comments on the ten commandments\nThank you that's my favorite that lost their\nParents earning behavior yeah in young adolescent and how should we factored that in yeah and my answer is that right now and they absolutely cars and not for a bad reason because that's really the only way you can establish a baseline for character\nOf a baby is born with character you have to establish in a way you do that is in your decisions right or wrong and I think in the case of Kavanaugh on other people\nI think it's far more credit for it to see someone who allegedly let's say let's say let's not even his cabinet 'cause I Want to keep them up something let's say like a convicted felon or someone who made a bad choice and you got to see their choices after that\nOut every time they had an opportunity they they either ... or they chose a better way\nTo say oh so you agree with me I Do\nGo up from a short whatever reason I I I misunderstood both see the the message on the screen and your opening comments when you ... know or resigning whatever yes I don't remember what you said around it\nYes that's what I meant like some people think well what you didn't matter and I'm saying it died because of this tablet share your\nPoll I say I see wait a minute oh I see so you're saying\nOh it matters in your too\nCredit yes I get it\nFor example right you know you can't control when you were born maybe you were born with all the luxuries and all the opportunities to make good choices and you just kind of did what your parents told you to do and just kind of like you never like for example I have never been around drugs\nIs not because I chose not to I just have it All right\nYou know you you you and I are really ... you and I are in sync it is amazing I I I'm not disagreeing or you know what I said I said to my friend in high school it's very interesting I remember saying to him\n'cause I I really was adamant and I really run a campaign against cheating on tests and I remember saying you know none of the kids in our class can get credit for not holding up a a store [laughter]\nThere's there's no there's no temptation to hold up a store we don't live in that advice like you I never saw drug you're right that's exactly right I don't I don't get credit for upstanding for drugs it ... it was never in my world\nBut but you're here but let's say you're ... or some we breeding them beyond your control you were born into that environment\nSnow I'm with you in a new show than you are a little\nBit for me I'm Better than their that strikes are\nYou a he or living thank you sir she Brian is living that Jewish aphorism I told you of that I learned and probably in third grade\nAnd the place where a panic stands a righteous man does not just that they're better the person who was turned his life for her life around is better\nAnd I cannot watch it\nI Do I I didn't have I didn't have much turning around to do\nSo you know\nI mean I get I get credit by of try to lead an honorable life I failed at times I'll be like everybody like most people\nOh but we're pretty honorable life and you know I get credit for that but I don't get as much credit as the guy who came from a from a drug background or an alcohol background or or a a criminal background\nTurning your life around is not easy I didn't have much turning to do\nMy mother thought I did [laughter] but that's because she

are living in a very different because we have I Believe for the next ...\nOr the survival of this country and we have I Believe in a very effective president Donald Trump or I didn't initially support I supported Ted Cruz I'd been with Trump ever since he won the primaries adamantly for I'm we're facing the left you know I I used to be this purists conservative constitutional conservative and I am\nAs I said on Sean Hannity's show last night a feckless conservatism is a conservative right and we and we like Trump because he fights back and get things done and I think he's actually become a pretty strong ideological conservative he certainly ineffective one but we had the left\nOut of the woodwork trying to destroy him trying to destroy everything in his path including Brett Kavanaugh and\nThey think they have a monopoly on morality\nAnd I think they they're worldview is so ... I'm Sorry to say it and I think it's self evident when you see a hateful they are how much they project how much they are exactly the opposite of what they claim to the I eat compassionate tolerant\nA loving their hateful they're mob there they'll do anything to destroy people the end justifies the me\nAnd so when when John Adams said that the constitution is only going to be a we're only gonna work for a moral and religious people I think what he had in mind for people like the left\nWho will destroy the court for example instead of upholding the constitution that legislate from the bench and if you justify the means they'll do whatever they want to do and we had to fight back and Christians who say we can't fight back because we are not being Christian they're wrong we have a duty we're not just on this earth\nTo sit here as bystanders we have a duty to try to preserve this culture\nFor our kids and for ourselves and what made America the greatest nation in the world and so I don't buy into this thing that we ought to be passive\nWe ought to be active and worked for him but there's one other intersection and that is\nThis is so controversial and so contentious in our culture but I think sometimes we need\nSomething greater to look to and that that's something greater in my view is Jesus Christ and so I think ... the books that I write on the subject are designed to get people into the Bible and reduce their intimidation and increase accelerate their learning curve so that they will also\nBe more comfortable and going to read the Bible for itself and that's really my bill\nI'm grateful for your voice and I'm grateful for this book because we're living in a time you know David to those who are who call themselves who are conservatives and spiritual\nWho
