was the case by the way on the question of the Muslim ban remember that\nSpring cord is necessary it's a crucial American institution and the Supreme Court has had his great moments of ten some sorry

interviewed by Kate Snow on NBC\nOr no but I Know who she is\nOkay you should go and watch it watch the whole interview\nThis woman is completely not credible this is a phony attack it is a smear this

signed on for that Bernie Sanders idea of Medicare for all what a Medicare for all means as Medicare for none because the system cannot function there's not enough money in it it can't even pay the bills right now it needs to be fixed\nBut Medicare for all means that all of a sudden you triple the number of people who are on Medicare and how do you pay for that\nAmerican culture and politics [noise] some might go on\nAnd on a they're a great day in his greatest nation on God's green earth and is this election very important one that is coming right up [noise]\nWell only sixty eight percent of Republicans used to think it was very important [noise]\nBut now after the Kavanaugh fight it's up to eighty percent of Republicans think it's very important eighty two percent of Democrats\nBut um [noise] I Do believe\nRepublicans are going to be more motivated to come out and vote and let me tell you why\nHave some things that we want to do [noise]\nUh other than simply\nBurn

Medicare for all spending the United states government literally into oblivion\nAnd it's come on ... this is craziness right now and this is talk about a civil war\nThere were issues and that civil what is the issue here\nWhat is it that that Charles Blow things is the key issue in his column that he writes liberals vicious war and by the way the next day or actually it was the prior day the liberals this war that this morning\nOn Saturday the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy crisis is by Michael ...\nAnd he makes an interesting point which is that for justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh they're the only two justices in the entire history the Supreme Court\nWho have been nominated by president who didn't win the popular vote and confirmed by a majority of center senators\nWhen you take all the votes of the people who voted for Gorsuch and all the votes of the people who voted for\nJustice Kavanaugh and you put them against\nAll of those gathered by the people who voted against them well there were more votes for the people who voted against\nCheap but this is craziness because that's not how the way we choose US Senators it's true that that Wyoming gets to the U.S senators there too fine conservative Republicans so to California\nAnd Wyoming as a population of about six hundred thousand and California has a population of thirty eight million they have the same representation in the U.S\nSenate that's how you find them more votes on the other side but just deliberately is the way they set up the constitution to protect smaller states so that you don't have a situation where everything in the whole country is irrelevant except for California and Texas and Florida\nAnd New York everything else doesn't count I I mean this is very obvious and yes\nPeople who vote in California you get to be counted in the popular vote and they certainly have a big say in the electoral votes because you've got fifty five electoral votes in but here's here's the basic point\nHis complaint is not against the legitimacy of the court\nHis complaint is against the constitutional system that does work pretty well for two hundred and forty years really what's wrong with these people you're going to challenge\nThe legitimacy of the court not based upon the qualifications of justice Gorsuch or justice Kavanaugh\nBut based on the fact that the senators who voted for the most of whom are Republicans represented states with smaller population than the people who voted against them one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six ... really it's foolishness\nA deep deep foolishness it seems to me and speaking of deep foolishness one of the um\nMost outspoken opponents of the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh will Spartacus or the one and only Cory Booker and he was out campaigning in Iowa why was he campaigning in Iowa is it because he is just enormously popular in Iowa does yeah\nIs pathetic and by the way there's this a judge Kavanaugh just made some history\nHe uh announced the for law clerks that as he is higher now the idea of a law clerk a law clerk does much of the work force Supreme Court justice the research\nOften drafts of the writing there had been a justices who do all their own writing but most allow the clerks to do some drafts and\nClerks end up having an enormous impact on a justices service\nFor the first time ever the for law clerks new clerks or going to be\nServing justice Kavanaugh Shannon grandma Megan Lacey Sarah no medicine\nAnd Kim Jackson\nBy the way that's came as a female they're all women\nIt's first time ever any justice ever has appointed all female clerks and by the way a he is now tied\nRuth Bader Ginsburg in the number of black law clerks working for him why because in her Thirty years on the court ah Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAnd saw quite Thirty years I Know a twenty five years now Ruth Bader Ginsburg has appointed exactly one black law clerk out of a hundred I'm Brett Kavanaugh was appointed one out of four first for\nBetter it's a nice thing\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six western Philadelphia west and you're on the Michael mad show\nOr you hey\nLook I Want to start with a question okay sure\nAre yes or no you agree that it would be despicable to make a false accusation against the person that would destroy his\nLife of course okay All right for them that were agreed that it's not\nCory Booker is not acting crazy he's a despicable person all of these Democrats are despicable people Christine Blasey Ford's accusation has been totally proven to be false or or if not in any way demonstrably\nTrue gee it's\nBeen okay that's a that's a different thing she is ... ... how has she been shown audio how has she been shown to be a liar\nOkay she said she was afraid to fly obviously that's not the case\nWell wait wait wait that was a statement by one of her lawyer she did not say when she was questioned by her lawyers gave an isolating on how\nThe second door on her house was built because she she felt can fight\nAgain this is that this is this is a lot I you're right and that's not something\nThat she said apparently something she led the put out there and her name I think we make a mistake if we wanted to attack\nA Dr Ford as some kind of despicable person I think she's I think I Do I Do question her credibility I don't think she has been

Can't think of anything that has produced a this this level of of negativity and craziness and hatred the board battle was close the Clarence Thomas battle was close\nBut what's interesting about that is there were a bunch of Democrats who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas\nThey weren't\nThere were unfortunately a bunch of Republicans who turned against\nJudge Bork and er here\nIt was such a strict party line thing but Susan Collins I think spoke so well for people who may\nBe in there are a bunch of Americans who are genuinely undecided anybody who's still undecided and you don't know well how do they handle it what what has really Kevin about she lives in Susan's calling speech\nShe made this clear\nI'm OK we will get to that in a moment she made clear that she believes that Christine

who could probably teach the class\nOkay now which which way which department of government uh handles the a sex ed for California prostitutes\nThat health and Human Services\nThat said they have a

point four million dollar only now overall every year ha Jeff doled out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants\nTo put that in perspective the U.S military every year at the department of defense or total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow a at it in terms of what you were talking about with open the books dot com you have a a basic approach\nWhich is the transparency is the only way to solve this is letting people know what\nI'm going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\n[noise] well that's that's the plan of the strategy that we outline first at the wall Street Journal then at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment in our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take this three pronged approach and ... lead by example Asia post all White House expenditures and then step to\nCut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report for the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nBut I think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with a White House and this is something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous nuts in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff\nAt President Roosevelt one world war two with a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today\nI I don't I don't get that at all what what about\nCan you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spend on that\nYou know the condom industry it's a very competitive industry but I'm\nA two hundred thousand dollars flowed into a Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for new condom design this is just one of the grants now they're obviously a small company we did identify Michael\nThat the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies and the entire world certainly in this country that over a three year period they received three point three billion dollars worth of our money American taxpayer subsidies and they cannot argue that they need our money\nUh there's another one here which is a cigar taste test in Virginia for a hundred and fourteen thousand three hundred and Seventy five dollars how could they hold the spending to just a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars for the cigar taste test\nAnd there's a lot of studies like that one point one million dollars of our taxpayer money one to prepare America's religions for the discovery of extraterrestrial life one million dollars went for a study on where it hurts the most to be stunned by be\nOkay well I guess is the theory is that if the government doesn't prepare you for the arrival of Esther extraterrestrials who will then we also spend money looking for extraterrestrial ... government my\nWell I think that was an inside deal that was twenty million dollars that the one that went to one of Harry Reid's friends and they went out looking for extraterrestrial life\nOkay people should should get involved with this and what I Love is the three pronged approach which is number one President Trump begin by showing how every penny is spent in the White House and a number two he cuts the White House staff\nBy ten percent and then orders every other federal departments cut by five percent and then number three he starts giving us updates every month on this war on waste because this was a war we can actually win\nIf you want to find out more

Democrats have not accepted or what the president of except for the justices of the Supreme Court we're at war with her and they said they're going to grant power\nAnd that's sort of you know it is it is not war war is saying things like we have to mount armies and stock supplies and live off the land and drive them out\nWhat's the Democrats are saying right now is vote vote vote vote vote and fine and good luck I don't think they are very effectively appealing to voters and the reason that this whole idea of a war doesn't hold a Jeff ... look John Adams said something very famous\nIn the American revolution he said a third of people living in colonies at the time wanted independence a third one is from Maine oil to Britain and the third one and simply to be left alone\nIf you have a full third who are willing to fight and another full third who are willing to fight on the other side yes you can have a very bloody war and they were twenty five thousand people Americans who died in that war\nBut uh we don't have that it's a percentage of people on the left who want to go ahead and how people out of restaurants or want to make this a war\nI think it's it's not anywhere near a

I Am hopeful and this is in response to Tom in ... California just asked him\nWhat about what happens twenty nine days from now when people go to the polls is less than a month it's coming up\nWell the reason I'm hopeful as this is that the most recent polls show real momentum voters on both sides are getting serious about this election they kind of know what's at stake but there's been more of a change in there is clearly more momentum right now on the Republican side\nAnd it's all about turnout midterm elections and generally if you go back historically there's just analysis was done\nThat shows that if Republicans get within three points on the generic\nPreference battle in other words when they ask you would you'd rather have the Republicans running the Congress or rather have the Democrats running for Congress for three points behind on election day we went\nAnd will almost surely when both the house in the Senate right now according to most recent figures in the CNN poll were four points behind so\nWe're almost there are the gap has been closing dramatically I think Republicans are coming together they're unifying one of the things that I've said on the show many many times\nIs that you win elections and you win political conflict when you can unite your own side and divide the opposition\nI think this Kevin all fight United Republicans as we haven't been United since um since Trump won the nomination

of protests should we do now and I mean there are hundreds if not thousands of comments and it's you would find it fascinating because you are a study of\nWriter and and you know here here's my my partial response to that and I I think one of the reasons that for people like yourself\nWho have had severe doubts about President Trump this does bring Republicans together because the point is if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh\nHe is about as mainstream he's not somebody who's out there and we had um a fairly distinguished lawyer at our at our table who had been part of the Ted Cruz campaign\nAnd uh he was at our table over the Sabbath and he pointed out that if you look at the names on that Heritage Foundation list Brett Kavanaugh\nWas the most moderate person he could've possibly picked if you look at his judicial record he is not someone on the extreme right at all he is a down the line like Samuel Alito like a Antonin Scalia he has a mainstream\nNormal very distinguished conservative so if they are going to make him a victim of this kind of character assassination that do it to anybody that do it to you and\nI I feel like as a conservative and the reason I was a never Trump birth mainly because I wanted to conserve conservatism or the long run I was playing the longer right [noise] um\nAnd I think you were to which really attracted me to your show

beginning work today\nHis presence on the court doesn't entirely please everyone in the country's pleases me a great deal I Will can\nThere are a number of people who are suggesting this is the end of the republic as we know it is beginning of a new civil war\nI there have already been announced intentions by a whole host of organizations and some leaders in Congress on the Democratic side\nThat as soon as they take control of the house of representatives so says representative Jerrold Nadler who is a very very very liberal Democrat from Manhattan\nA representative ... says he's going to be the new chair of the Judiciary Committee of the Democrats take over and one of his first orders of business in fact his first order of business will be a full investigation and impeachment of\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh good idea you look forward to that of course they also want to investigate President Trump or on the grounds impeachment this has been going on for a while\nIf you voted democratic in these upcoming elections you're voting for this insanity to continue\nWhy is it good for the country what do you hope to accomplish when I'm Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday was officially confirmed by a vote in the U.S Senate of fifty to forty eight\nIt actually would have been fifty one to forty nine except senator Steve Danes of a North Dakota\n... wanted to participate in his daughter's wedding and look as somebody who last may participated in my own daughter's wedding our own daughter's wedding I understand how the senator felt and Senator Murkowski who voted wrong on Kavanaugh in my opinion\nI was very gracious and saying look she will keep it so that it will be shown that I'm Brett Kavanaugh actually passed with a to vote margin the final vote would have been fifty one forty nine as it was it was fifty to forty eight because she just voted present All right fine um [noise]\nThis is what it sounded like when Mike Pence announced the final vote he of course as vice

and what are they aiming to achieve what's fascinating to me about this is remembered that dramatic Thursday it seems like another era where you had testimony from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you hadn't testimony from Brett Kavanaugh very very high profile everyone's watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any\nThere weren't whether Germany nobody nobody no ... and now somehow they were able for that to control these idiots and I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that or are idiots indeed\nHonestly if they can control it in a high profile situation that shooting troll it every day\nThis is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic that people should be able to come on and into the galleries and screaming shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is really prosecuting these people\nAnd I'm making them feel that disrupting Congress when doing its job and by the way\nI Would include all of the conservative demonstrators who do that kind of thing as well why do I say that because there are not I mean it's just not something conservatives do what can you think of the last time\nThat some right winger interrupted a the proceedings of a Senate committee or the Senate in session making an important decision like confirming a springboard justice of the Huffington Post\nPut together a collage of some of the truly eloquent inspiring voices that had been raised against the Kavanaugh's confirmation [noise]\n\n\nWe stand with Dr Martin we've Dan with survivors in the\nMiddle East country is facing\n\n\nOkay uh throw them out\nBecause and this is going to help why I actually I Love it and I'm Glad to give it a tension and by the way let's a link to some of that that footage just really wonderful to watch and I I Need to describe it to\nA group of demonstrators came up to the doors of the Supreme Court and the sprinkler building in the United states in Washington DC\nIt's a wonderful building and that Greek temples style all based upon the parts on an Athens and classics because again the founders of our country\nIdentified with the creators of Greek and Roman law they did I Know ... more white males though again there are people and African studies departments who claim the ancient Greeks were really not white but leave that aside um\nMeanwhile these folks came up to the doors of the Supreme Court building and the doors are those heavy metal doors that with carvings on them and big candles\nAnd so a group of demonstrators came up to the doors Supreme Court building banging on them literally budding their heads against them screaming and shouting and sounding like this\n[noise]\n\nWhat is the the clear message here that we're supposed to be getting I Will tell you I think there's a clear message is overwhelming was clear\nIf you think this stuff is good for our country and then of course you want to vote democratic coming up a month from now you you do because the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know it\nUh and basically some of the Democrats on the Senate floor wait to hear Cory Booker Spartacus\nOr who really has jumped the shark I mean it's it's just if this is your hysteria\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh\nI think he's talking about ... you'd think he's talking about uh uh he even analogize is the ah the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty or some salt on the individuals who are expressing their opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nI I mean what are we talking about here\nWhy is this appropriate they they have of course had a song or what would be a liberal occasion unless you actually go to one of the protest from Saturday immediately after the vote it sounded like this [noise]\nBelieve me\nThat's right [noise] so do not have the de la [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n... already done so\nJustice Kennedy was a moderate on the Supreme Court he was appointed by President Reagan Reagan he was he was a as a matter of fact confirmed unanimously\nYeah Justice Kennedy was\nAnd its Justice Kennedy who swore in\nBrett Kavanaugh on a Saturday Night\nA meanwhile there's another piece about the courts legitimacy crisis analyzing the votes behind the senators who voted to confirm justice Kavanaugh will get to that let's go first to Adam in Atlanta Adam you're on the Michael ...\nI'm like I'm really disappointed I cannot believe you actually compared to judges one one was actually accused of sexually sexual assault gotten didn't for the\nUse of anything so I Know and that's what we're going to do is actually wait wait that's\nExactly the point that there was that he wasn't accused of anything he wasn't called the radical he wasn't he wasn't cold heartless Merrick Garland a basically they\nPostponed I'm considering his appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nMan nothing about the fact of the matter is actually the woman who actually accused of sexual or a so\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important\nThat um there was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing\nInvolving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no X Y Z there wasn't enough thing\nA clean record until literally after his hearing had concluded and then they threw a Hail Mary pass and thought they'd make some hay with this one which is totally uncorroborated\nExcuse me you are not there so you can\nI say it is totally on robbery did you write I wasn't there but what what is it that you think should this be the new standard now\nI'm going to tell you exactly what we should've done okay we should have done it so investigation fairly is not a reason for us run to Russia a lifetime appointment we'll do respect we should have just white and do an investigation investigation and then if it actually done this or not\nOkay again off again ... ... if there was any available evidence\nTo confirm any aspect of Christine Blasey Ford story even the existence of this party the witnesses that she named said they have no recollection of such a party they don't remember it she didn't tell anybody until Thirty years later\nThe the entire thing the whole idea that

misconduct in perjury against judge Brett Kavanaugh if they win control of the house in November So says\nRepresentative Jerrold ... the New York Democrat in line to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee well there is only in line to be chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Democrats take over the house and the polling is showing that it is not at all a sealed deal\nAnd part of that is the the other side is increasingly desperate and a ...\nI mentioned before this big story by a Wall Street journal reporter named Asra Nomani who is not a conservative but she went out and talk to demonstrators and she relate a research all these different demonstration\nAnd virtually all of the organizations behind this behind a screaming and shouting and the hysteria and and the craziness\nReceived some money from part of the Soros family of organizations is what George Soros calls the open society project now this is not a conspiracy theory because it's open it you can trace where this money comes from\nAnd the the idea\nIs that we should take it seriously or that it's a reflection somehow of of grassroots sentiments that people are banging on the door the Supreme Court and saying shut it down\nDo you think it would help a in the United states if we simply shut down the Supreme Court\nSo that there would be no final arbiter and disagreements between say of various appellate courts that might reach different conclusions that was the case by the way on the question of the Muslim ban remember that\nSpringboard is necessary it's a crucial American institution\nAnd the Supreme Court has had his great moments just had some sorry moments as well Dred Scott was the worst of the screen corn moments but his hand great moments let's hope that it has many many

with me on this Jerry and she remembered Justice Sotomayor or who was confirmed with Republican votes and Justice Kagan do you remember any attacks on them from Republicans and on their personal on

president's personality okay what is it about the Republican Party right now that you see is vicious\n[laughter] what I see the tax I mean granted even really consider I'm for it they don't remember the Ford Ford investigation of Republicans in concert\nOr did did Donald Trump do ya meaning that if you don't think you but she got enough or do you notice that\nThey did not try to impugn her and in any way and yes that happened with Anita Hill but that was a different situation in a different time with Dr Ford can what comment was made by any Republican senator\nDuring the time that she was before the committee that then insulted her or questioned her or smear her in any way\nThat was a political calculation\nJay but it's it's a it's an eye out it was it made my way that's right okay but
