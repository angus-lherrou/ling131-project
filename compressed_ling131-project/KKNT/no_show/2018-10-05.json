{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "Contrary to what I had implied not all immigrants from the end of the nineteenth century went to their own enclosed communities in the United states so what changed in the Nineteen twenties\n[noise] well what changed in the Nineteen twenties is when you put in place immigration restriction legislation really changed the landscape for the immigrants were already in the country both face less competition from newcomers and so it was somewhat easier for them declined the economic ladder\nThat's not to say that that restriction was motivated by the purists motives in every case\nBut the upshot is that it gave some breathing room\nParticularly to those working class immigrants so they could enter the American middle class and also their kids to wind up living in the suburbs\nThey wound up forming these more integrated communities and embracing an American identity they might feel a you know clean different aspects of their older ethnic identity it but it was more symbolic\nRather than a live the experience that separated them from other Americans and I think that that's an important part of the story of why you wound up having more unified more cohesive American middle class culture in those years\nThen specifically that they're more limitations on immigration in other words that I Want to know if I'm summarizing you're pulling accurately back is much more likely to ensure a melting pot than separation\nIf there are restrictions on immigration is that a correct summary\nYes I Do believe that having control having some limits\nAs opposed to having an uncontrolled policy can make a big difference it looks at melting pot more likely to happen that doesn't need on saying we should go back to the policies of the Nineteen twenties\nBut it does mean we need to be mindful of the context in which immigrants arrived in the U.S how to control writing in a in a context of racial but to share with your identity politics and identity politics extremism it's going to be a very different\nAll the way back so I was just going to say that the second part of your title you made the case on the melting pot but your title is melting pot or civil war question mark so the civil war comes when everybody has their own identities\nExactly when you have the situation in which you have people who are fighting over\nNot just class differences but also over ethnic differences the danger is that might get some kind of group that sees itself as a marginalized excluded underclass and that the ethnic mentioned to that and when you get demagogue politicians\nWho are claiming that hey wait a second the reason you're in the position is because of the other people with their wealth\nAnd with their power that's why you need to pare down the system that's what I fear is going to happen in the years to come you're going to get this kind of in a ... pit bulls identity politics will become even more screen will get more\nSocialist politicians will bring this kind of identity extreme than I Am\nSo I the reason I asked you earlier about what language was in your home was I I Do not at all oppose in fact I'm for\nImmigrants teaching their children so language that they came from I ...

conviction read an immense amount obviously more than the average citizen can mean people this is my work\nOther people have all the work that they have to do and I appreciate that fact that's part of the reason you're listening to me is you hope I can still some of the opinion a knowledge out there that you just don't have time to consume perfectly understood\nJustice you would expect your doctor read more about medicine than you do that's that's the hope anyway so let me tell you that something interesting seems to be taking place in the United states\nThat of course is not reported by the press which is an arm of the Democratic party and the left\nThey they don't even make any bones about it and useful is that right well that's that's one of the examples that I Want to get just today I Am thinking of a piece by a commentary commentary has been anti Trump\nCommentary one of the most important historically one of the most important conservative magazines in the United states has taken on an anti Trump or conservative flavor unfortunately but it is what it is\nAnd I respect these people I'm not sure they respect me [laughter]\n\nI I Do think that there is a a a very early ... there was like that's what my point I think until the Kavanaugh hearing\nI think that was a suspicion among many of the anti Trump conservative intellectuals I'm a conservative intellectual who was pro Trump and I think that the handful of us\nHave been\nSuspect in the eyes of a lot of these people and like and they've written about it then is Prager is devoted his life to character to to speak about character writing about character to the importance of moral I mean this was in the Atlantic I mean there's bigger ... one of the tax on me how\nYou know the guy just what happened to ... sold his soul\nAnd now I think there is something changing when they realize what made it you know they're not going to say well maybe guys like ... I don't I have no desire for them but it's not it's the last thing I think about but but using me or Victor Davis Hanson\nAs a as an example of a decent conservative intellectual a decent person that is\nAnd the conservative intellectual\nUsing us as examples they may sing you know well maybe they didn't sell their soul to the devil\nMay be they did understand we are in a civil war in this country and now we see it if they are prepared to destroy with zero zero evidence\nA man based on a high school report that came out the week before his nomination was to be voted on if they can do this\nIf they can destroy a person's reputation with with the wives and trivia T through ice at a guy in a bar in his freshman year at Yale\n... reported in the New York times is wonderful\nI Am thrilled what else do you need to know about that New York times\nIf someone were to ask why do you have contempt for mainstream media that will be one of my examples because the New York times saw fit to print all the news that fits the print is a tomato that fit to print\nAn allegation that demand through I said the guy at a bar and his freshman year of college\n\nYou're a laughing stock to half this country of course the Lex lobster you you could write that the man showed his payments to four hundred people on the New York subway and they would love you\n\nIf you just why didn't we day they would love you on the left truth isn't a left wing value destroying the writers power is\nBut\nWhen the when the non the left of the country can start having contempt\nThis is a big deal this is a big deal\nThat's why this is this has been a a dark moment and potentially a powerful we'll see obviously in the elections the elections will be accomplished as to what happened who won't be the next gainers from the Kavanaugh travesty\n\nThat's the question the smearing of a perfectly decent good man read the report of the a BA which does not lean right and is re emphasize to despite its it's foolish president but\n\nThis is a this is a very important moment\nThis is one of those Clara fires where the naive and you see they think I sold out my my fellow conservatives who who don't understand why I have supported the president\nAnd I think they're naive okay that's that's what the spotted amounts to but naive take is indefensible\nAnd an adult right that's that's that's it's not a sweep dismissal it does it obviously I'm protecting their dignity and their integrity you could be a fine human being\nBut a few of my IV you take very foolish stances on very important issues\nBut ... the wall Street Journal which has been extraordinary extra ordinary\nHas written andme editorial which the living martyr considers one of the most important in the history of the wall Street Journal I think they've written so many important ones that it's hard for me to rape but I just want you to know chief who was not prone to hyperbole\nThat's good I like that he who is not prone to hyperbole\nSaid that\nRepublicans are well aware of Mr Trump's excesses and false Hodes but they have also come to understand but the resistance to him isn't rooted in principle or some or gust coal to superior\nCharacter they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen despite her history of deceit\nSo\nThat's why we're so fraudulent oh you care about characters she voting for Hillary Clinton that justice now must be adjusting\nVoters knows is about the left will to power by any means necessary that's pretty powerful stuff by any means necessary\nWho who uh who made that that line famous was it lemon that's if that's a that's\nNot an unknown line by any means they they chose those words for reason\nThe final sentences\nOf the\nWall Street journal editorial Republicans across America can see and certainly there are senators voting on judge Kavanaugh should realize that the left hates them as much or more than they load Mr Trump\nConservatives understand that for the American left they are all deplorable\nNow but I Will miss my whole life\nI have never ever been fooled by the left and I I Believe\nThis is the name of his column the title of his column today for once I'm grateful for Trump\nIn the president won big bully stands up to others I Can't wait to read will have bred um bread is done in Britain and I are are good friends and we are obviously have a rift over ... over Trump or we don't have a rift between us\nAnd in fact he devoted a whole column to me a ... which I thought was wrong not not the only comment to me but I thought he wrote was wrong I devoted to call up to him and then he had me on the New York times Facebook to debate can't ask for more than that\n\nBut the Brett Brett Stevens for once I'm grateful for Trump it's because of how disgusting this is and to Brad Stevens credit listened the first moment a few\nFew moments of crystallized my view over the past few days this is Brad Stevens in the New York times anti Trump conservative the first moment was a remark by a friend I'd rather be accused of murder he said then of sexual assault I feel the same weight Stevens right\nOne can think of excuses for killing a man known for assaulting a woman\nBut if that's true so is this falsely accusing a person of sexual assault is nearly as despicable as sexual assault itself Prager wrote Twenty years ago the rape of her name is also a rape\nThe\nThey're coming around on me coming around to Dennis Prager I mean just coming around if you are a Republican or a conservative and you are still anti Trump you are more preoccupied with feeling good about yourself been doing good for your country\nPeriod period\nThat you think Trump is a greater problem than the left what the hell is wrong with you\n\nThe second moment connected to the first boo hoo hoo Brett Kavanaugh was not a victim that's the title of a column in the Los Angeles times which suggests that the possibility of Kavanaugh's innocence is infinitesimal Mazie\n... there's there's no evidence there's no nothing nothing but it's infinitesimal\nYet false allegations of rape all relatively rare or at least five times as common as false accusations of other types of crime according to academic literature\nHow often do you read that thank you Brits defunds since when did the possibility of innocence become for today's liberals something to waive off with an arch sleep on feeling boo hoo well I'll tell you the answer Brett\nLeftists are mean liberals are fools but leftist are mean\n\nI I read my last call them my friends are

I'm curious to get your reaction and I always tell guests our remind them in your case because he'd been on quite a number of times totally free to differ with me or\nI now sense that the capital of hearings had been a turning point in that\nThe future of the Supreme Court with that issue a Trump follow through on that promise by nominating Neil Gorsuch and no Brett Kavanaugh the other reason many many people\nVoted on the twenty second election wants to vote against Hillary Clinton because of the implications of the Clinton presidency falling on Obama's two terms and they did not want a Democrat\nOr in that office and I think these hearings resurrected both of those issues down is the status of the Supreme Court indeed the law in the United states and behavior of\nThe judiciary Democrats and the party of health have reminded a lot of people of what the faith of that party looks like right now\nThey're just mobbed inside the hearing room outside the senator's office to

ah you know it is going to be up to the Republican to sustain that energy is somewhat worried that a Kavanaugh is confirmed this weekend that way for all of a cross that\nCrashed on the shore and the

candidates do but here we are a month away from that election\nAnd nothing bigger is going on in American politics right now the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh which is just as I said that it is I really think it has become a binding okay yeah for a lot of them are\nWell that's exactly the the other thing is as you and your editorial uh both at the explicitly by the editorial implicitly by yours that we're all deplorable now\nThe soft they believe they really do or or at least they lie effectively they one of the two that people like you and I\nDo not care about sexual
