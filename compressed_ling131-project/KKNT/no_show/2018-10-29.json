challenged or even a God Forbid really God Forbid offended\nThat how that works\nSo here it is every body and\nWhat made me think of this topic was actually the last hour the previous hour talking about nationalism so I have a theory and you've probably heard we say\nAbout ... thousand or so times 'cause I have a lot of\nTheories about life ... theory that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are\nAnd they are in no uh in order of importance just three identities that I think are they are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness\nBut they are not sufficient if this is this a loan doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they're great contribute tours\nTo one's happiness a sexual identity male or female a national identity and the religious identity [noise]\nI think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those am I won't even identify them 'cause it's a happiness our on everybody to listen and everybody would be as comfortable as possible\nBut there are those who are working to\nNotify those identities and say that they they really are not real and they are not even good\nBut that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population by knocking these identities\nWon a Prager seven seven six so that I Believe that the more comfortable you are with being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl\nAnd that is that is a serious part of your identity sir I Will be totally or buy a graphic here I have always been I'm very lucky I admit it always been comfortable with being mail\nI've never wanted to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and I celebrate ... to ... to whatever extent that his celebrate a boy I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgendered and I'm not even attacking the trench I live on the contrary you is not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nOr bend your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness if it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it's something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try still to maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you gotta really my reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness\nWe're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female so that's one identity I identity is in fact almost been given a bad name oh he has an identity ooh that's not that's not good next is a national identity\nI think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAnd ... and I think I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness and I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I Am a man\nOr or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more I identify as this is my thesis of this happiness our the more you identify with\nThe the greater your chance for happiness in third as your religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is for Christians obviously there are the majority great majority of you listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're more men if you're if you're Catholic if your Protestant that fewer evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every ... ... ... it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee in life\nYou can be a you could be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very

him and I remember how many people called and it was amazing to me that is so much so that one time there were so many people who identify themselves to tell you Hi Venice so I just want to say to the pre Selma next Catholic or I'm a recovering Catholic\nAnd I I I I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves egg nobody called ... say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter]\nSo ... we had this this I these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called any was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns who would apparently raptors ... with a ruler when he was when he was twelve I might tell them you know I Am and I'm not Catholic but it seems to me after Seventy eight years you might want to give that up [noise]\nI think they can move towards shrunk slightly isolated especially in the Democratic right now I live in New York I live in New York ... and and now you have it so I feel but I feel strongly about the environment\nProbably out of your children feel\nWell I have one boy and he's actually the thing and then found out and he's he's good [laughter] he he's\nAlso ... who do you have who do you have these conflicts with\nA more of a trend more like an online find your extended family in\nWell look I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says it's true\nSuzy who wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely it would be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't it interesting I mean of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you

science\nOr I Diane I have learned from the ah John I asked job to call back from Illinois and from the first hour because he doesn't agree with me you can go on\nOkay yeah I Hope I Hope we hope I can express myself and we don't interrupt each other and call to yell at you or anything\nLike no no I Know that I only interrupted you because you\nMade a point that was so dishonest and I'm not saying you did it deliberately that I had to stop you because otherwise I Would have let it go you compared antifa to the Nazis of the past instead of the Nazi use of the president\n... ... is the most violent group in America today\nIt's not the most violent group in the world in history go ahead\nOkay well maybe we can touch on that as well but uh I I look at a series of events that I reach a conclusion I Know you reach a different conclusion but here's here's what I'm saying and I want to know what you think\nAh in May of last year a racist to pledge to support that Donald Trump and adjust to just attended a a big a right wing rally murder two men on a commuter train when he was\nConfronted him when he was a cop in Muslim women then in August of last year\nA self identified neo Nazi also a Trump supporter in Charlottesville, Virginia killed a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia Heather Heyer she was not a member ... she was part of the majority of people opposing the neo Nazis who were simply residents of that town or students or parts of religious groups that are coming to stand up to the organized racist\nOr I see the president celebrating and endorsing violence against or journalistic Montana I listen to his antagonistic rhetoric towards his enemies and now we have what appears to be a right wing supporter of the presidents president engaging in a massive assassination effort against\nThose anti antagonistic or critics of the president\nAnd I hear you say that ... is the biggest\n... and the liberal ... no no I don't know the economy at all and\nI said the ... say the left is I it then the first part of the left\nI'll probably tell you okay I heard what you said now can I respond or do you want more say more\nIf I can just finished my thought I was gonna say I also hear it and while this bar the bombings were going on I heard a lot of people in your line of work\nI'm Sorry while these bombings what bombing in yeah sorry if so what what bombings the the all the mail bombs that twelve okay you know they're not bombing you have to be precise John nothing bombed okay obviously we are so they weren't no bombings the ... statement bombings okay\nI'm Sorry if I start something that confusing you didn't\nKnow and I don't know no no no you're dishonesty ... I'm Sorry to say this or you didn't confused me\nYou live there were no bombings John there were no bottom is that accurate or inaccurate did you confused me or were you an accurate answer me a boy and confused me or were you an accurate drink Don I didn't filibuster\nYou spoke the whole time you're already made ... nobody laughs at me by by Okay John ... a John as dishonest and it's painful for me to say I asked them to come on again I gave them plenty of time there were no bombings and then he said he confused me\nCan you play with language my friend the left is a far greater threats of violence in this country there were a right wing despicable human beings who do despicable things there were a left wing despicable human beings\nBut let me let me show every one of my friends I Will be speaking at Colorado State university next week I Will need or I won't leave security no leftist needs a security at a at a university that's a far larger issue than one crock pot here or one crock pot there\nNobody has a monopoly on crackpots book the left has a far greater dominance of violence of shutting of people they don't agree with\nIt is extremely difficult to enter a campus with a conservative thought is effortless to enter with a left the store I don't know what country this man lives in but it is it the same as the one I Do okay and\nLet's go to Alex in South gate California Hi Alice Dennis Prager\nI gotta thank you for taking my call thank you and I want to thank you for being a good moral um subject in my life I've been looking for thirty six years I started listening to you and we're going to get on the line with what has been shown\nThat it's not you so you started in your twenties in your twenties [laughter] yeah I Know I\nStarted at my team [laughter] I mean that's well about is that right sooner sixteen Seventeen years old when he well feeling Glendale hoping to meet you about where your neighbor got day\nWell vats clinical you go on\nWell and and particularly when either one or both of the parents remarry and you're bringing in a one or two more\nYears old at all writing\nAs parental units I think it's extremely important and in my own divorced\nThat was a not the case he was not a what we call a good divorce if there is such a thing and it did have some major impact upon our children are they're saying there are mistakes that I made certainly\nThere were things I was not aware of but I think you're absolutely correct on that on that issue it doesn't alleviate everything but it does go a long long ways to help them deal with what is\nNothing but a I mean almost all the time a bad situation for the kids there are certainly exceptions\nYeah we don't they'll work no no obviously hot listen yeah you're very thoughtful man and I appreciate it\nBut I think we're in substantial agreement look life is filled\nWith obstacles to happiness and filled with landmines and that is how we navigate our life that ultimately determines or ability to handle that hopefully and with some degree of happiness\nI\nHave a lot of a lot of lot of thoughts on divorce and I should I haven't talked about in quite some time I've talked about a much more in the past and I will address again thanks to this call\nBut he and I both agree that the issue is what you do after the divorce more than the divorce I mean many things are factors including what age you you divorced what trial the child's age\nIt's it's very different if the child was too that if the trial was twelve or the trial was twenty two\n\nThat's that's it it is he says no comparison in fact\nBut\nBut the the most calamitous results by obscene or when a parent the parent the parent ... the other parent de legitimize as the other most children are attached to both parents\nAnd even if you are right\nCertain you're right the legitimize of the other parents in an old but the most most egregious cases is a sin against\nAgainst the child against your family or how are you doing there yeah All right I won't I won't take a call because we're going to take a break in the moment\nI think that\nPeople just need to understand very few lives are smoothed including kids from intact parents how many people are at the psychiatrists and psychologists parents never divorced\nThat's not to say that all things being equal that's the ideal of course it to be

Americans and how wrong it is so you know this is this is I and I noticed you backed off of these old my kid wants to play plans because he loved loved prince\nBut you're not going to want to put black shoe polish on his face or black makeup to dark and his skin because you know how offensive that is\nAnd that sort of that racial short of reality you could say it's a double standard but it is after all the reality I let me take you to a Jew or in the NYPD\nRight now breaking now on the Mike Gallagher show\nThis is the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism of the NYPD in midtown Manhattan holding a press conference a briefing about the latest uh intelligence gathering and the investigation of these suspicious a mail bombs that have been sent now or that have been sent in the mail here here we go to New York city\n[noise] ah that whole sole worker was able to notify the u._s. postal police on scene hair\nContacted the joint terrorism task force of analyzing the\nThis area was secured while emergency service\nMan why ... responded\nBack it was isolated [noise]\nUh and the post office\nWas able to do their equipment to conduct an X ray\nThey saw what appears to be a pipe bomb\nConsistent with other devices what you're saying that we\nPainted a package consistent with the fact that we've seen this week\nWas addressed to that end of April [noise]\nI'm at a location in Manhattan\nWhere I was able to safely removed that packet\nOf ice and\nEnter the containment vessel\nAnd transport that highway outsource to\nAnalyze the range Rodman snack where it'll be biased in a secure storage area for the FBI who will then transported along with the other suspect the device was seen as we\nWe I live\nWith me I have\nA little bit from John Miller with the NYPD there should be transporting this and there was video of the one of those big trucks with the containment facility so that nobody could get hurt let's pray that whoever this\nCo producers caught quickly\nWe know you're not always going to\nTo morning are advertisers mind being from\nCleveland media\nYou're on ... studios I Am familiar with as\nUsually my son's riding in the last ... hours a week with a Hillsdale dialogue\nStarting the week with a Hillsdale dialogue and Dr\nLarry earned because we're eight days from a crucial election and we are on the other side of a terrible massacre in Pittsburgh and the range bomber in Florida and the incendiary rhetoric across the spectrum\nAnd I thought some history would be used for your documentary on good morning and thank you for doing a double dip this week\nA good morning how are you\nI'm good I I Want to begin by asking you to put a what the no nothing movement in context is because last night I saw a lot of people on line saying that Donald Trump is leading the modern no nothing's\nWhich is simply not historically correct and I knew I could turn to you for similar to a new ... were\nA well so nineteenth century political movement or they didn't they thought that uh Jews and Catholics and\nAnd they're they're especially focused on them\nAnd you know I don't know why anybody would be ... million Jews but Catholics now that I Would say that we have to have to deprive ourselves of the of our sense of humor in these days but um\nThey they ah you know let Lincoln a lot of them voted for Lincoln a Lincoln denounce them\nAnd what they thought was that uh it was a Protestant country of white country and that it would be better if it remains so\nAnd they and that you know they were spread around the country quite widely they never had a huge percentage of the vote and they were important because you know and in fact there isn't anybody quite like that important enough to to make a difference today that I Know of but they were important because politics for very narrowly drawn for\nFifteen or Twenty years divided on the slavery question but then ancillary matters\nThat could get four or five or two or three percent of the vote could change things a lot so they were important in American politics\nAnd they were ah they were not a passing phase they'd never really gone away the idea of nativism in the eye that white Protestant on the country\nBut neither have they ever been very powerful and I do not believe they make up much or even an infant decimal percentage of the Trump coalition I don't believe I asked Secretary Clinton when she was on the show last year do you believe there's more than a half\nMillion white nationalist in the United states and she agreed with me that there isn't and and that we're mixing up two hundred and thirty million people\nI just don't believe it is that many people do one of them can do are ripping slaughter as was done Saturday in Pittsburgh we ought not to overestimate because by doing so we encourage the rest of the nation of their hatred\nA trade and ah you know I and not only do I do not believe that they're very many people like that I don't believe they're very many people who believe that they're very many people like that in fact many of the people who say that there are a lot of people like that I don't believe they believe it I think it's a political tool\nYes and explain why\nBy the way I think it's going to burn their hand for picking up this tool a and specifically I talk this morning\nAbout uh the network to which I contribute MSNBC is running high rise to lower third so little the words at the bottom of the of the screen I Want to read to a couple of them Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans how Trump such the tone for anti Semite\nYou see they have picked up this this white hot slander and I don't think an insurance to president I think it burns to people who employer what do you think\nWell so this is a really great Holleman Jenkins ... column on the wall Street Journal I read it this morning it might have been for the last week um and he makes the point that that a\n... you know everybody except for tiny sliver of the population or all of whom are probably watching MSNBC who knows\nUm think that there's just way too much of this stuff right that that this politically correct talk\nOr this you know Megan Kelly him I have never liked by the way\nBut she got fired and if she just left off one expression what she said was entirely objectionable and somebody at Netflix to write and sell their chords that go after but horse how big are the whores right and I and as you say in a country of three hundred million plus\nHow big are these hordes and the answer is not very big\nBecause most people don't think I mean if you just walk about in society and look\nYou will see the evidence of the fact that the society is organized around the principle of human equality and what human equality means of is a person treated like a person treat the same person like a person\nSo you just see in society today and it it wasn't always true with black people by the way which is a blight on our history but you but it is true today just look and see\nAnd then you know ... if you think it's always been a racist country go study the Eighteen fifty eight election for the Senate in ... Illinois where Abraham Lincoln won the popular vote on the claim\nThat the black woman may not be are equal in all respects but in her right to eat the bread that she earns with the split of her own face she is the equal of every person on earth and I I Want\nArgue audience where you've added to affiliates today a documentary on who have not heard you before and therefore will take some getting used to we have to not have been considered\nA news radio fourteen WTO being Dover, Delaware and radio news radio fourteen fifty W. I. L. M. in Wilmington, Delaware so they will not do our was one of the states that Lincoln had to worry about keeping in the union right donor was was a slave holding state\nHim at the time in the civil war and Lincoln had to work very hard\nAs he said I Hope that God on my side but I must have Kentucky he he needed the states and so he acted as a political person with regards to everyone in there but those sorts of politics\nThat sort of new one is lost in cable land I mean it just it's all your evil or you're not evil and by the way it's not just on the left is on the right as well and I think it's destroying politics\nI don't so I think that's right and and you know there was a lot of extremism in America in the Eighteen fifty goodness sakes you know there were plots to kill Lincoln and one of them succeeded finally [noise]\nBut but it's also true though that those debates between Lincoln and Douglas or very worth reading\nAnd then if you read them fairly in my in my argument if you read them fairly you will see the the inspiring man one and the man who spoke for the meaning of America One and it's just a remarkable event in human history because\nThey would get twenty thousand people out in the sun sitting for four hours to watch those debates\nAnd and that means that in America there is this you know basic way that we get along as Americans and it's the principle that everyone who demeans himself as a good citizen quote George Washington\nHas the rights of a citizen and must all and and that means that the bias is there's a bias\nThe bias is when you encounter somebody on the street tree in like a human being\nA man who spoke for the meaning of America One I think that is so ... would you explain what that means\nWell the you know and so you know all political history by the way has tragedy in it or there's even an argument that it always ends in tragedy a tragedy if they're very many remembering that it's the most glorious political story at least in modern times\nAnd the tragedy is that for the first time we found it a country according to the principle that all men are created equal\nAnd buy all men they meant women too and and then we had savory among us and been here for a long time thought here under British Rule and so what do we do about that and in the founding there's a consensus that it's a really bad thing\nSomething's got to be done about that eventually and in more than sixty percent of the union it was quickly abolished\nA but then new ideas took wrote in this road and this is where the tragedy is in my opinion these new ideas said that nowhere evolutionary figures\nAnd we evolved to be different kinds of things and by the way if you look at the thought of modern liberalism radical modern left wing liberal is some you will see lots of thinking just like this fight we talked about genes all the time now [noise]\nSo uh it's like it's like somehow your genes control your behavior which means the human soul is not free anyway that gets going and by Eighteen twenty that's a major force in America\nAnd then what are you going to do about it right and then the and what we did about it was we fought our worst war over the question is the human being a product of his heritage or is it a free soul created by God\nAnd you know it's just another great fact\nThat about the United states of America that George Washington and Seventeen Ninety eight brought to the Hebrew congregation in Newport Rhode Island\nThat it is now no more that we speak of religious toleration or by the intelligence of some that others enjoy their inherent natural rights and that is probably the first letter written by chief executive of any country except ancient Israel to some Jews addressing them as equal citizens\nThat the American heritage and there's no reason to believe that Kevin McCarthy does not does not feel the weight and greatness of that just like everybody who knows this story and that and it's an American does\nExactly and on left and right except for these crazed neo Nazis who are an evil and we're talking about that even when we come back [noise] let me also encourage you during the
