against the for the opposition to Columbus Day\nIs they regard him as a genocidal maniac is a monster how could you have to have a day named after a monster but the the bigger\nIssue is if it were Columbus or it it was Smith or it was a some anybody else it wouldn't\nMatter it would be against him the idea that the west supplanted indigenous cultures in the western world is to them

R. Y. double G. H. E. T. right so it's\nIt's the feel so comfortable and secure everything is taken care of\nNow\nOf the prices you pay is you know you pretty much have to think like everybody else you know think of a box\nAnd you just and\nLife becomes this is me I'm not reading from the article life becomes I've often said about Western Europe life becomes really a debate about how many hours I couldn't get off how much vacation time I couldn't have how much I can travel and it sounds awesome adjust I mean what could be better at work less\nI'm taking care of this is utopia\nContinue six months ago my two year old niece broke her leg the physician who treated the girl told my brother in law that his daughter would be given a full body seat the scan\nTo which you might say huh\nShe broke her leg\nThe doctor wants to give the the girl a full body seep the scan the doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory but not for any medical reason I Wonder if a single one of you listening knows the reason\nThe doctor ordered a full body cp scan of a two year old girl\nThat's a lot of radiation by the way a two year old girl gets a full body scan for a broken leg\nEverybody I Know the reason there's no way you don't think there's any one of the I ... I couldn't catch fire was thinking why she getting a full body see peace can write the doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory\nGet it mandatory he had no choice\nBut not for any medical reason rather the Swedish social services administration\n\nRequires such scans to look for evidence of child abuse while the doctor did note that they're broken leg was the result of an accident but\n\nShe told my brother in law the matter was out of my hands\nThat is the doctor saying the it is out of my hands I have no say on whether your daughter get to see peace can when the girl's parents refused to subject to this unnecessary procedure\nThe hidden machinery of the Swedish welfare state spring into action [noise] my brother in law and his wife were required to attend multiple interviews with social workers and to submit to friends and neighbors in in their small town\nWhatever it is you're addicted to\nBut the the choice before Americans and before Europeans in before others is\nAre you prepared to give up liberty for the sake of being taken care of and the answer is almost always yes and the more that you are given the more or less freedom\nYou really want\nThis is the great experiment of the United states the great experiment is liberty\nLiberty in God we trust the blurb soon our more like cold America trinity wrote a book on the American ... still the best hope\n\nPeople are not necessarily in sync with us take care of people take care of my if you take care of me take care of my children\n\nThat's why people are home schooled their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of the parents the states should teach your children\nWho the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate

because no matter by the way it doesn't matter where the immigrants come from\nHim every immigrant comes from a country on a society that values being taken care of more than liberty\nBecause there's only one country on earth that values liberty more than being taken care of and that the United states\nSo it doesn't matter where the person comes from from Asia from Latin America from Europe they\nAll the immigrants the great majority of them not all by any means dropped the word all the great majority come from countries societies mindset that value being taken care of more than they

promise the president I wouldn't criticize any sitting member\nOf ministry issue that could be a multi puts the reasons she's a mother to be personal reasons could be some other remove with regards to politics so let's wait and see who he what he called a a friend\nIs very interesting that having a joint press conference so this is like Rex Tillerson remember ... just\nSmoke he just disappeared from when the president have having novel in I resigned because at that time and the eight months we had been a stretch too there were a lot of people inside the building and you know on the ... agenda uh eight solved the ... the national security advisor included but but\nMike I Know everybody needs to talk about breaking news but this really isn't a big deal of people come and go into the ministry patients whether to Clinton whether it's Reagan's this is all powerful the coals these jobs you alive I truly you alive\nAnd uh let's wait and see a suit for what the reason is for the resignation\nAnd I'm Glad you said that because it's it's easy for all of us who are sort of observers\nTo say how do you because I always instinctively say gosh why would you why would you leave the White House why would anybody walk away from that job and of course\nI can look at my own career and I've made decisions that people have said why did you do that and it turned out to be a pretty good move for me but you know at the time people will say oh my gosh you're resigning from WABC radio in New York and yeah I took a chance going into syndication and it worked out don't you know you're Twenty years later\nPretty good I mean if the people make decisions based on things like the the the brutal treatment you get when you're in that fish bowl and so I I really do get it um and maybe that's what this says it must be something to do\nSebastian if if if the two of them are making a joined announcement it has\nTo be something that's positive is good you know what I mean and and people are going crazy with them on my tax line of people calling in saying things like maybe is is is Lindsey Graham going to become attorney general is she going to get some position words that we could I things around ...\nDown and find a way I\nDon't know you're you're getting your your getting to be like the the the crazy in the mainstream you know and now it's better to do that for that sort of back that's a big insult Dr ... and ... when when the less goes the chaos in the white you know the\nGuys in the last twenty months there's been payoff I Will say oh yeah\nNo kidding me looked calling me you know it can you look at the border you look at unemployment is this I mean you do have to understand the president there isn't your average bureaucrats and he's not even a politician right he's the man who has been round ... successful in the private sector well\nYou talk about chaos Dr ... you're talking about chaos to bring me the kind of chaos that results and judge Brett Kavanaugh now\nIn the hill who oh in the here\nIn the history of book shop too has there ever been a more perfectly Times Book than your book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies because let's be very blunt here sometimes America's enemies are from within and what we all witnessed over the last few weeks I\nI Know you had to be as disgusted as the rest of us\nTotally because I Lived in I've been through it all the accusations made against me in the White House and you know we we had a saying in the west wing ... when all this stuff was going on you only say slack when you're oh the tile games but but this\nWas disgusting and the interesting thing about my book why we find which of course I wrote long before\n... was was you know dominated Ryan is\nThe shock during the by the great American here so the book is about ... threaten America faces and what the president's going to do about those but then I have these personal stories about four amazing American heroes and the last one is a guy called ... that could change the most\nAmericans probably Ninety five percent of millennials ... never heard of but we didn't get a shame because most of the tunnel before capital was gone so just just a little sound but\nThis is a man who stood up for the shoes and the first televised congressional testimony ever in Nineteen forty eight right he stood up to say I was a former communist and I can tell you who the communist orange by the government and what happened\nTo him the left when crazy they accused him of having an affair they accused him of being a closing homosexual they used to being responsible for the problem is that all of mine was a lie that my sister lives on\nThe end of the day he won because he stood up for the truth so anybody who said that he was just going by the treatment jobs ... receives a guess what the Democrats have been doing it for about seven years\nMind and and it's gotten so bad that it's almost as a fever pitch and frankly I'm hoping and praying that Americans remember\nWhat has happened over the last month\nCome November the six because you know there and they are on record you know it and we've seen them

Sorry\nOkay well congratulations you're dead an amazing job\nWell ... thank you and I uh my part was to make sure we had a ... and that we had eleven votes to get it out of committee [noise] but I think a real turning point when Senator Collins speech an excellent speech\nAnd now you can see how the liberals are ganging up against her and they don't have any right to do that because she's written very much of a feminist rowdy time and they raise money and three million dollars to run against her and I think conservatives ought to get my saying thank you door and making sure that she\nDoesn't face the uh the onslaught of this a mob that was a a up against Kavanaugh\nI think the center left of center right will rallied to her greatly in twenty twenty if anyone has the dumb enough to run against Susan\nCollins of Maine like running against Chuck Grassley of Iowa where you just don't do some things center a I have Michael Yon last hour he explained to me that he and his family were talk to their private information put down on the Web did that happen to you as well\nA monster but not\nTo the point that it affected him in some other senators I got some midnight calls

phone calls on that particular night out I think it only happened one night to me so I was fairly lucky look at what happens to people like Rand\nPaul or Mrs Paul and ... and I don't know how many other senators or even Cruz being driven out of our western\nAnd what happened to a couple of months ago to the president's press secretary [noise] uh this is mob rule it's in your face and we have senators that are saying get in their face wherever and Congress women say a ... a confined to a cabinet members\n... if you see them in a restaurant [laughter] and um and it's a sort of thing that leads to more instability in our society and\nIf anybody thinks there's instability in Washington\nA Washington is kind of a reflection of the grassroots but on the other hand those of us that are public servants ought to set an example of civility so we can get this country calm down bring us together so a book or saying something like get in their face or I'm\nA congresswoman waters saying what she said it's just a it's not the the enemy of leadership Republicans and Democrats in Washington D. C. ought to be emphasizing\nNow secretary of State Clinton a poll Christiana pour yesterday that a civility only possible after the election that that you can't be civil the people who are trying to destroy you were you shocked by her ... her comments\nYeah of course I was shocked by it and I hope they're Republicans and I assume are common income because Kavanaugh was successful or we were successful in getting cabin on the courts so my rallying cry for the next twenty eight days of this election is remember cabin off and\nI Hope that we are Republicans and I hope\nPeople that want Republicans voted for Trump to realize that if there is a Republican majority in the house of representatives\nNot only will there be talk of impeachment of Kavanaugh or the president's but even if there is talk of impeachment\nEffectively the program of the president's going to come to all the all have a two year a Trump presidency the last two years we'll be status quo Tana let's say he's reelected\nThat she ended up so if you like the victory of twenty sixteen uh get behind Trump handful Republican congressman came from a Republican majority in Congress otherwise Trump is done\nNow a Senator Grassley I always ask you about pending nominees there are ten appeals court nominees before you three are out of committee will all tend to ... nominees get a vote before the end of the year\nWhile there's more than town there's forty one on the counter right now and I think there is Hannah Hannah and our committee and I think all fully Thursday I get the pan out of our committee above ... ah McConnell fought to keep the Senate and session until we get all forty one of those judges dot\nOrg I'm an ad ten can work through it and didn't want to do it\nThat's what I'm Talking about the appeals court nominees and I'm Wondering about the candidate a vacancy on the DC circuit is their time for me to come out of the White House and be confirmed by the end of the year for the DC circuit nomination vacancy created by Brett Kavanaugh's promotion\nIf we received it right now the answer is yes but just before Christmas so\nKind of depends on how how long will be in ...\nAnd by the way I'm not to denigrate in your effort to get ten a circuit court judges approve because I'm In favor of them as well and we're ... we're pushing them for instance we have to ... Ohio Supreme Court judges on the counter for today's hearing as one as another example\nWhat's all pointing to take care of Ohio center I'm from Ohio so I I'm all in favor that let me go back and ask you about a an interesting thing Lindsey Graham said you become chairman and I immediately looked over Chuck Grassley where Chuck Grassley going in is there another committee that interest you more than judiciary\nA well don't forget the first four years I was chairman of the Finance Committee there's two more years I can certainly the chairman of the Finance Committee but I won't be making a decision on that and my decision if I were to go someplace else would affect Lindsey Graham ah but I'm not going to make that decision until November the seven\nThat right now can you tell me if you think I'm a member of the D.C bar I'm also remember the California bar a I'm not actively practicing law now that they might easy bart is do you believe the district of Columbia Bar ought to investigate Dr ... lawyers because she said she was not aware of your committees repeated offers\nTo come to her in California\nWell it's a it surely isn't representing her client right and and I'll leave it up to the bar association discipline action\nThat they ought to take I won't be invoked myself in that but we do have some members of my community that are raising a lot of questions that went on and it went on and regarding the shenanigans of Democrats here within the last ... months particularly the Ford letter being exposed to [noise] uh\nAnd uh and some of my Republican colleagues think that we ought to do some investigating along that line that is within my prerogative I have not made a decision to do that yet but I'm going to consult with my colleagues on the committee and make it the a collegial determination on that\nNow you do have jurisdiction your committee over um the FBI and the department of justice I Am curious if you were interested in using the jurisdiction to investigate the disappearance\nOf Mr shockey in Turkey because I think the FBI could be of help if Saudi Arabia invited our I talked to the vice president about those invited our people to come to their embassy what what is your reaction to what appears to be a state sponsored execution of a dissident journalist\nWell it would it would be true of whether uh the terrorists were a killing somebody or\nA state knowing it it's still a as far as I'm concerned something that violates a not only a human rights but uh international treaties and we and icy journalists as protections for not only for people\nBut at least in our country there the policemen of our democratic system if there are biased\nAnd so do you think there is a role for Congress in pressuring the Saudis to come clean with what has happened here\nI think they ought to us because we're so protective of them and so supportive of them and particularly against their Iran's ah and we're very much in battle with Iran through sanctions and\nPulling out of the uh you know nuclear agreement and that's very much and Saudis interest they ought to do it just because of our close working relationship\n[laughter] alright last question senator I always ask you this because it is interesting to me is the History Channel by myself you and I are probably the most consumer the History Channel out there is it getting any better\nThe world over the last two years few\nUm and uh I'll be headed to the Asia Pacific here and in about a month\nOr as a as I met with world leaders is I have witnessed a response to President Trump's leadership uh on on the world stage there's no doubt that America is respected again and that is a credit to the president of the entire team and and uh\nAnd we are so grateful for the contribution to Nikki Haley made to that causes well\nIt does take some spark on some charisma like ambassador Haley that's why I bring up Grinnell Robert O'Brian and and James ... we got to have some sparkle there\nWell look it's a it's the United nations is a big stage\nAnd are having having the right talent they're all of those people are are outstanding people or other people are actually the ... there's a great number of people that have already expressed an interest in that position but I\n...
