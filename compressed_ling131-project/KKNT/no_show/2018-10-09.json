we can stay home that's the last thing you can do\nAnd I I it's really weird I've been thinking a lot about Roseanne Barr over the last couple of days\nBecause it says if for the first time there was a push back to the left ... demand that somebody's head would be on a platter\nOver something but in this case wasn't corroborate first time this has happened I mean normally careers are gone lives were destroyed people's sliver away into the darkness never to be heard from again this time Brett Kavanaugh fought back\nThis time Republicans were unified on the political front we witnessed a unification within the Republican Party that we haven't seen it a couple of years or more\nAnd I was thinking about how somebody can be destroyed over something like a tweet\nAnd you know at the end of the day maybe maybe\nThey'll push back on behalf of judge Kavanaugh and the Republicans deciding no we're not going to destroy this man\nOver this one accusation\nI Know there were a couple but the the first one is the one that was deemed credible you notice the you hear the Republicans who read the FBI report the word incredible is used for Dr Ford she seem credible is what all of them said\nIt just wasn't corroborated so you couldn't\nEver ever take him down over her testimony alone\n\nA couple of times I've seen some references to Roseanne Barr evidently that show that she created and return to is going to be back\nI don't think it's returned yet to the air isn't it next week or this week we're going to call it the Connors and they apparently killed off Roseanne all because of her tweet about Valerie Jarrett and it was make no mistake it was a terrible tweet\nBut it was a tweet one tweet and her lifetime of work was suddenly consumed by the fire of the rage machine\nPS she's a Trump supporter\nI saw over the weekend there was a a an NBC reporter I Believe a young NBC reporter who a few years ago\nWrote a bunch of homophobic tweets that can happen to her no she's a liberal NBC report your Roseanne and you re tweet or\nTweet out a racist comment about Valerie Jarrett you're done\nAnd maybe after Kavanaugh\nWas pulled over the finish line by a unified Republican Party in a fight or if a president had a fighting spirit on his part\nMaybe just maybe\nMob rule\nWill be brought down a few a few notches maybe the mob won't continue to win\n\nBecause the mob didn't win this time the mob lost there were so many videos I was watching over the weekend I traveled to Florida that's a long story but kind of looking at properties around the country and maybe I'm\nLooking to relocate and uh just the to the tax situation they're going to chase me out of New York I mean there's just it's insane I just refuse to keep paying whatever it is fifty three percent taxes and I'm looking and I don't know anybody in Florida but\nI Know some people in Florida but there's a beautiful parts of the uh Florida Texas I don't know yet so anyway I went down to Fort Lauderdale over the weekend was checking out some things there\nSo I'm watching everything in the hotel and I'm In the car and I've got satellite radio so I'm listening to to Fox News and\nAnd I was just I was just stunned by the way this is all playing out I'm listening to it I'm listening and I'm watching this thing progress\nAnd I'm thinking by guy she's going to get this and I was really negative\nBecause we're in a culture now the mindset is the the meat to activists many of them say accusation made accusation believe if you believe the accusation that means you have to condemn the accused\nThats the formula although I Will say and I'd like to find lamps or the audio clip from Tijuana Burke\nWho's the founder of the me too movement from years ago so this is not this was a woman an activist who started this a long time ago it's just gotten kind of a resurgence with Harvey Weinstein stuff she set on on meet the press yesterday\nBelieves the woman doesn't mean don't have an investigation\nShe said it never meant you believe the woman he stopped there and you're on the person's life she said believe the woman means you listen to the woman you believe that nobody is probably going to come forward and make it an accusation but you have to get an investigation you have to corroborate that was I was really relieved to hear her say that\nShe after all was the woman who founded this whole me too movement\nAnd that's what happened with Brett Kavanaugh there was an investigation seventh one actually I saw senator on TV over the weekend forget which one who said yeah there have been a hundred and fifty witnesses\n\nOver the course of the investigations into Brett Kavanaugh's past not one of those people said there was a problem with drinking so there was a problem with sexual inappropriate is\nAnything other than ... and then there was nothing other than an exemplary life over seven FBI invested investigations\nI Wonder who could survive that kind of scrutiny\nPresident

officers when he was shot\nDead the jurors found\nOfficer Van Dyke guilty\nAnd the jurors said they just didn't by the defense of the officer that it was his they wanted him to trust his memory not really the dashboard camera video to know what really happened\n[noise] um you know one of the things that strikes me about this would guilty verdict when there is cooperation\nVia a dash cam video or body cam video\nOften a police officer who was guilty of a terrible terrible crime and this was this was a bad shooting this was not he was not defending his life and you can see from the video the kid was walking he was high on apparently PCP he was walking away from the officers he had a knife in his hand but they shot him\nBut they are officer Van Dyke shot him sixteen times\nUm when it happens and there's cooperation officer police officers are always held accountable their ears accountability and there are consequences for a police officer\nMaking a mistake guess what\nHappens all the time the officer in South Carolina who shot the guy in the back remember that the the gentleman who was fleeing because of a traffic stop and the guy just stood there and brace just shot him a bunch of times in the back and killed him a kitten caught that on tape\nIt was corroborated and now that guys riding in jail officer Jason Van Dyke is going to go to jail for a long time was convicted of second degree murder this happens all the time in America when there is proof an officer\nIs held accountable showed the narrative of the black dubbed the of the protesters and the the football the

do immoral and the illegal things to try to save their own Fannie\nBut frankly\nThe nation I think breathed a sigh of relief an officer Van Dyke was convicted on friday um this kid and I don't know how it would have\nPlayed out in his I shared with your the video for a week ago when a guy with a knife was lunging at a manager or a security guard rather in a Burger King in midtown Manhattan right
