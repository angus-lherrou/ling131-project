Trump says stuff that no one ever says like when Reagan said Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall people lost their mind you can't say that\nI really believe as you do as a Christian that these are prophetic words they shake the demons tremble when you speak truth to power and when when this president says something like a cabinet you are an innocent man in front of the world in front of the whole world\nPeople lose their mind because you have just spoken\nA powerful truth that everyone says you must not take sides you must not\nAnd so he is a ... I mean most people who like him understand that but I think a lot of people on the fence trying to figure them out and I really thought first of all with all this hour in this in our time the bitter sour left you know a ... banging on the Supreme Court door and shrieking or like dabbles and and behaving like chilling this madness\nFirst of all we need to\nHave some humor and to celebrate what is

talk to him because the swamp people up protect him he will only talk to people who live in the swamp what do we do so they go to Donald Donald is a kind of a famous caveman he's a builder of caves everybody wants to have built by Donald\nUh and so they go to Donald Donald can you help us are they telling us that the situation he says well tomorrow you know I've got some time I'll go down to the swamp and see what's going on so he takes a walk down to the swamp encounters a first swamp creature\nA lobbyist tourists and the lobbyists or a says you don't understand you can't talk to the king the king doesn't talk to people who live outside the swamp he only has been living inside and so I'm so if you want to live in this one maybe work something out dumped has not interested I'll see you later so he goes back and tells\nThe cave people he said listen it's worse than we thought wouldn't have to get drastic and he said they said what do you mean drastically use as we are going to have to drain the swamp and they kind of get scared like you can't say that don't that don't say that\nHe says I don't know if the only way and if you will how you gonna do you're gonna get a swamp people angry because when you're angry aren't you and they say yes\nAnd he says well maybe it's their turn so\nThe next day he decides I'm going to dig a trench either builder he knows how to do this kind of the world is not a war with China and Mexico is not going to pay for it but he says we are going to build the biggest and the ... trench we've ever dug and so he goes by himself with a shovel down to the swamp now the swamp creatures come out one of them looks\nA little bit like Chuck Schumer one of them might look like Hillary Clinton I'm not being specific about that office all you yeah the artist that when you when you look at it you can figure out who these people are but but they get angry they said we live here you are sitting there and and he says well what do you live where we live\nYou either live or where we live and they say we don't wanna live outside the swamp the people who live outside the swamp\nAre uneducated they're on cultured they're deplorable\nAnd he understands that you know what bowling needs to do is dig the trench and ignore these creatures so he starts dig the trench and as he's taking the trench he sees that the swamp green color the swamp is actually the color of money why because the whole swamp is money\nThat's why the swamp creatures will not leave the swamp so he starts digging and then the biggest battle swamp creature ball shows up and he's angry the biggest better swamp region of all is called\nThe George Soros and the Georgia sources really angry has bags under his other than the he looks Hungarian and he looks like a

Marco Rubio sounds distraught and everything I see from Panama City and I hear from Kendall Airforce bases homestead after Andrew is that what your ear and yeah\nYeah and you know you had to remember this part of the state you know it's interesting [noise] it just doesn't get hit\nWith with the mild hurricane the that this is for some reason the way that things turn they either make a you\nKnow go slightly south of that area and will you know across the state essentially just north of the uh for\nUh interstate or they fear a little farther to the west and hit where I have family in Pensacola I mean this was so odd perhaps the panhandle in Pensacola basically all I got to understand um it's so this part of Florida see it's it's a double\nWhammy here it's the most you know one of the\nMost powerful storms in the history to stay\nIn an area that hasn't been hit very often so it just adds to the devastation because you haven't had the clearing out of trees with smaller storms in the same but you do in other parts of the state to just doubled the impact and then just think it was just the only good news is that it moves fast the only good now\nI remember after a homestead the Indians were going to move spring training them set up that was gone that air force base in gun I Wonder if ... done what I'm hearing is true luckily they got all the people out with a thousand military families and then the left\nAnd here's here's the thing you and I\nBoth know we do get\nThe Pentagon think there are too many base within the country but there's no political will to close them but if any of them don't work they get close to what happened the homestead your look I remember homestead was going to be our new airport you know that was that was another idea to try to you know instead of trying to ... you know\nTry to expand my international airport which is some argue too close to downtown as it is\nRight for flight paths and things like that and and you know what it just didn't happen unfortunately home states to to to sort of not\nWasn't was which is too far south for the rest of the population and that's my fear of what's going to happen to them and they're not my fear of what's going to happen with the beach communities will rebuild\nUm because you know those people are pirates man and I say that I Know that\nYou saw it I mean I I you know they're not nine to five are some of the man for the call for some of the people that I Want to be in my next nine to five and a resilient\nTheir resilience they'll rebuild but it it is going to have a big devastating impact on the economy\nWill follow that let let's switch to a story I Do not know Jamal ... D I read and stuff in the post for a long time I ever suing the story with the vice president yesterday and will continue to do so a senior administration officials today\nIt comes in the context of a very delicate relationship last night run termer Yousef our typing actually had dinner together that a a event honoring Mike Pompeo said this context is an incredibly sensitive relationship but an outrageous extrajudicial apparently murder\nGive you this is going to be look I think this was going to be a long term\nFight inside this country and says this government about what to do in this country really inside the government I think you may see I think that I as you know the Trump Administration is very close ties with the Gulf states and all the Gulf leaders led by NBS\nUm all of it has been about trying to create a coalition essentially against Iran you know we know what the strategic reason is behind it it's all about Iran\nUm but you know how much how much can you look the other way on that I mean this is and I can tell you you can't\nAnd I don't think the diplomatic humidity is going to allow\nYou know this idea you know the president is already pushing back on the ideas of sanctions hey we've got too many other things going on with the country the relationship is too big\nI have to tell you I think when you see I think there's going to be this is going to be just like with Russia where there's going to be a bipartisan groundswell\nTo punish Saudi Arabia here including from corporate America look I think at the end of the day the most effective tool against the Saudis on this affect the punishment is going to be inflicted by corporate America more than it is by the United states of America or in the government because\nIt you know and be scares a lot about it about Saudi Arabia's reputation around there are and I I\nI I think you're already saw a company's there's gets a tech conference we get the times pulled out the whole bunch of tech leaders say well I didn't know I was on that press release so I think they went to sing on that yeah fine tune\nThat desert is over I think it is likely that the Henry the second defense comes up you know he says well no one written me a ... metal some pre stern for crusader run over and kill back at you think we'll get the the offering up to\nA someone just read this the wrong way and met NBS didn't want to kill the wanted and brought back\nOh well I've already look or Richard Engel reported on my show two days ago that there's already shatter that this was rendition gone bad it was supposed to die\nUm and that that was an accident um that'd be a better a mission that make that that one thing to say um but right now they're still just denying anything ever happened show ... there is\nI find it fascinating at how comfortable ... how aggressive Turkey's been on this I I have to have to admit I was skeptical that they would be the ... to ... ah I I'm I'm Still waiting for him to get there to want on this one all that said\nWe should live in the real world on on this when it comes to Saudi Arabia NBS is trying to essentially eliminate all his enemy\nWhether their family members are not right he's trying to consolidate power people that try to consolidate power also become um become potential target I didn't give me yes I just think that that that the Saudi Arabia power struggle\nIs something that it's going to become the foreign policy challenge for this country for some time I have a feeling that it may get uglier inside the kingdom for NBS\nInteresting interesting let's switch to the cabinet of fact I think Eric Holder's videotape Secretary Clinton's comments\nHave armed the Republicans to take what was a big story and turned into a category five story I think it's going to drive like the ... numbers this morning are terrible for him a Martha McSally is gaining I think Jon Tester's in a fight now how long does it last Chuck Todd and why do you think it lasts that long if at all\nI here's the IRS mood here's the good news we're going in the field Sunday\nFor national um in fact I just did an event last night with um a Wall Street journal and ... and all that stuff we didn't have that with our two pollsters film actor from prison gang asked them this very question when are you going to feel comfortable to know a if there's\nHow long the cat and the fact is going to be there and and and how and how real is it and you know uh\nBasically asked you know the the magic ... says ask me again in a week you know you got to see is it how to stay in a ... is it it's pretty clear that red got redder\nOkay that's clear what's not clear and both of our pollster for saying that last night in the places that were bad for Republicans they're still bad for Republicans right in suburban America so it\nIt's very possible that we are on this bizarre trajectory where we could have a forty feet ... and ... for the Democrats and the two seats on again for the Republican I just I don't know if you visit this map is that\nIs our erratically bizarre I I I don't\nKnow if you saw Jacob sober off CIA that's not very far from where I live where I'm In California walk it all on talking to UCI students none of whom care a lick about that [laughter]\nSo disappointing to people I Believe it either so are we again over estimating the people out there versus the people living inside the beltway who just beat on this\nYou know it's funny you we we had this we had\nWe had a debate in my that many yesterday actually or two days ago about this\nIs
