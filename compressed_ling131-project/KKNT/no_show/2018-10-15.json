everything else to the extent possible remains the same\nStability is a key factor and the happiness of the trial\n\nBut there is a bigger there that's the overwhelming that's the ... the heading but there was some things the single most important thing you can do is not bad about the other parent of a child\n\nThe number of parents who do bad mouth some cases poison children against the other because they're so angry is very large\n\nUm in most cases I Would consider that evil\nYour anger at the\n... the other parents for divorcing\n\nIs between you and that person the children should not be part of it\n\n[noise] that's a very painful topic ... if there's not a lot because I ... I endured it is a painful topic because I Know how many people have endured it\nWhere kids were act it's coal parental alienation uh syndrome PAAS I Believe\nWhere the anger of the parents so great that they will deprive their child of the other parents because they're so certain about how evil the other parent is going to the fact that the other parent divorced them\n\nAnd so it's a form of selfishness and self centered this that boggles the mind\n\nThat's a very bad thing the children don't want to take sides\n\nI have known parents who have every legitimate reason to be ticked off at the other who were aware of tremendous\nDefects in the character and parenting of the other parent I've kept their mouths shut\n\nThey've been say one bad word about that other parents these people all of a special place in heaven I'm tempted to say that The Poisoner's have children of a special place in hell\n\nThat's a very big guideline there's another big guideline\n\nDon't spoil your child because you're guilty but you divorced\n\nThose are my two big guidelines its own poison the child against the other parent\n\nAnd don't spoil the child because you're so guilty I see I see or you could see this actually could see the way in which a parent who doesn't see the children\nMuch the entire time that there with them so why would you like to do well would you like what can I buy for you they wouldn't have done that if they were still an intact family\n\nSo here's the overriding guidelines in this part you are still the children's father the worst spilled the children's mother that's your all your enough there buddy children can have a hundred buddies but they only get two parents\nOkay well I'm a ... seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThose are my guidelines very big topic because of the millions and millions tens of billions are you assume of divorces have money in the actual number\n\nSince I don't know my team Seventy\n\nYou are still the child's parent that that it will go as close to ensuring the child's happiness and healthy development as anything\n\nThe child wants you to stay his or her father or his or her mother\n\nIf Iraq were the guilt over the divorce him spoil the child then you have spoil the child I'm spoiled people are not happy\nPeople entitled people are not happy people people whose parents isn't the parents are not happy people every guard rail has to remain up\n... you still make demands on your child in terms of behavior this is how you act and you you don't have a competition between the two parents about who can buy them more goodies\nThat gets through to\nDo well good I'm Glad you're reinforcing my my I had to guide lives don't bad male the other parent and don't spoil the child I'm sure you've

door open for a moment of clarity communicating\nWell You're welcome\n[laughter] oh my one question I guess I got tons of 'em but I guess the one on top of my mind is\nThat\nIt would be your advice for honoring a parent who's withdrawn or not really interested in being involved with me and my family we kind of moved back to divorce issues and what you're talking in the\nPast our hum button or\nI guess for the effect from a divorced childhood [noise] um but I guess in starting a new family started over what's my mom has done the fame and she has a totally different experience but I'm with him I don't know if it's more\nWhere I got me I mean you need to understand something so he that your parents divorced and then he withdrew from you\nI guess not not not to or not I I'm not intentional outside but\nLike over ... years\nHaven't started new families both of them my father is more than of involved with new you know and his wife\nRight so I've been so why why summarized you accurately you're saying that he withdrew from you because he became preoccupied with and you know it seems that way so you're asking how old are you honor him 'cause I'm a big one on honoring parents in almost every case so I don't know so\nMy my biggest one apple about um okay well that's my biggest example of honoring parents staying in communication if they don't if they are a ambivalent or if they are recalcitrant are hesitant\nYou have to do what you have to do\nSo uh you you you make you make periodic calls or you send an email just checking in if they don't want to respond they didn't you we have to do the right thing and again this is this is my single biggest example of why I Believe people need religion\nPeople for me to be told on or your father and your mother because of God wasn't behind that a lot of people would not honor their parents\nSo since God told me the honor my parents are unless it is an extraordinary situation of pure evil on their part I have to do that how they respond is their business whether I honor them is my business\nWhere I heard a a one sided relations\nYou're right so what do you know what they said you send email and that's it\nYou you won't be able to uh have a peaceful life\nAfter your parent is gone you did your best you will have no guilt feelings I don't know what it costs you to periodically you get in touch it's not a big deal or if there's no positive reinforcement than there is no positive reinforcement my father called his mother every night\nShe yelled at him every night he put the phone on the kitchen table I'd hear her

the juicy it you know ... on on matters of face\nOr you know I always say if I don't I don't expect agreement and it's not even a significant to me so so so there's different ... but the ... it's the values that's why we speak of Judeo Christian values not Judeo Christian theology\nI I agree but I guess it is a book if I say for example divinely inspired\nNo where God Speaks to why you say it is just as much guard as God Speaking in the Toro\nBut but where you have other statements that it doesn't say and God's set so then it's as I said like proverbs or ecclesiastical ... that is not from

Blume attorney Daniel columns and Kenneth Lay\nA Dianne Feinstein erupted in anger Don McGahn the departing White House counsel abrupt at an anger I'm happy as a clam because this was the death of the blue slip a bring us up to speed with your reporting on this\nSo I mean I don't know this is interesting to watch the progression or not the progression of the killing of the Ninth Circuit vacancies which we know is the fact that a circuit court out in the west particularly in California and all those western states on and it's been fascinating to watch because\nThe fact that I Am at the White House had rapidly filled vacancies and all the other circuit courts and obviously the district court the attitudes Supreme Court vacancies but they really struggled in the Ninth Circuit and a part of the reason is several the vacancies we're out in California\nUh the White House has tried to you and has had a larger to shut up working with senators that their home states decide appropriate educational nominees or vacancies in their home states it obviously with California\nHaving two senators who are Democrats and two senators particularly who has the leaders of kind of the resistance and it turns out these judicial bias we're talking about Dianne Feinstein who of course if that had Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee and come on hand to the new member of the Judiciary Committee but also because it is a\nLeader among the left and the and the president and potential presidential contender and twenty twenty the White House has held off I'm feeling to concede much to the frustration of conservative such as yourself and I'm finally what happened and you know the\nThe Kavanaugh up I was over and last week we saw those three vacancies up with nominate put forward and we heard very clear from Democrats on the phone call I Harris as senator at that I find that you are not the nominees that\nThey had consulted with the White House thought what was that I like I like you got all the names of one was Lucy code someone someone that the Democratic senators and the judge said who heads up during the Obama administration on that day and the two senators thought these were consensus tax\nAt the White House disagreed and they put the nominees forward and how far they advance I can say there's not a lot of crime less and less than a year um will be interesting to watch as well because I you know the candidates out until after the election\nAs a lame duck I'm not quite sure you can push through all those nominees in a matter of six weeks so we'll have to see\nThere are twenty nine confirmed federal circuit judges already under Trump Trump and there are twelve or Thirteen more pending and I believe at least a half dozen of them will get through I bet you Mitch wants to get the forty but up to your point\nI had been told that Andy guilt bird was going to be a Ninth Circuit judge ... has a friend of mine in my age would be a little bit older than the normal and sixty one or maybe ...\nHe would've been older than the normal in a court judge but everybody loves to go for he's a great judge and I understand he was going to be nominated I Am wondering if they\nIn response to Feinstein's attempts to take out of college and all that that basically burnt there is no British accountable Harris but there was a bridge the Feinstein do you think have you heard if that's what happened that they just said screw this you're going to pull this stuff on camera and we're not\nPlaying chess with you on the Ninth Circuit\nI don't have definitive reporting in that sense I think you can be the you know the timeline of events and that the fair conclusion to draw because I got her party earlier and the year I Believe back in April about the struggles of the White House distilling those nice if they could be the sources at the time told me that while\nThe widely ministry and have ignored the blue slip boost the tradition I'm Out at several other circuit vacancies obviously David ... circuit being one of the more prominent example that up in Minnesota\nThey there was a different situation when it came to find time because she was nine will be a democratic senator but she was the leader of the Judiciary Committee and you know there is a certain deference there still\nAnd the fact that you know you know Grassley has to Senator Chuck Grassley have to push the economy through it but he does very good working relationship like that and find fat\nBut there are a lot of these dynamics that play that even the fact that he thought that the White House you know kind of defiantly relief the greed out and he said that I work at his house on yet just days after the bruising fight with a with judge Kavanaugh and that\nI think that the sign of that but you know we try to you know you know they're they're thinking that look we try to work with the two Democratic senators we were clearly not going to land on nominees we agreed with and the White House and I thought like dominate people who they the facts and they just look for a while but\nI also think that the improving prospects of a not only retaining but increasing the Republican majority in the Senate\nOr in bold and the White House I'm Talking with Sean men Kim you ought to be falling or on Twitter as you and G. M. I. N. Kim some income is the brilliant reporter for the Washington Post on courts in the White House and other matters\nLet me turn to reporting not speculation I'm speculating about what happened with the anti overdone and Forrest Gump but it was she co\nI'm reporting now that senior members of the department of justice are planning on a transition\nThat Jeff Sessions is not going to make it to the new year I don't know what they're that they're just planning on it and that means I got to find a new attorney general I'm writing for the post about it this week I think it should be included and but I'm reporting that they're planning on the transition I Do not have reporting that the White House as a preferred candidate do you\nAh have reporting segment on\nOn who will replace your obsessions\nI'd tell but I think this is a transaction that we've actually thinking for a long time because of that one of the most bizarre carpet strange that that the president's relationship with his attorney general a former Senator Jeff sessions to what are the\nKind of doors Donald Trump when it was a presidential candidate he took it turns out that they have probably the most toxic relationship\nWithin the administration because again will have to wait and see what the results are November elections at the Republican for tank control of the ... or pick up the side and attorneys general after I got that shows with all the dynamic surrounding nomination\nNot only the fact that the attorney general is generally a contentious and high profile nomination but obviously you have the Russia element a silver platter as the ... bill continues\nSuccessor is going to be pretty hard to come out and I think that it's hard to see at this point and um we've talked about that say we're not quite sure who can get confirmed and this device that environment and we actually have one senator\nSenator Ben Sasse who's on the district Republicans have your ... when the last ... the you know the fray between President Trump and Jeff Sessions blew up and the public has made it clear that he has not confirmed any\nUm any replaced emphasizes that would be that comes from\nFact that sessions

is not an abnormal attorney general though we'll just have to wait and see 'em but I think everybody has pretty much expecting him to a you know we go out the door of the month\nAnd I think people

sessions where they got all it'll now every three days they're they're functionally agrees that but they're not technically not voice resent the fact that\nThey can't avoid it at the end of Congress
