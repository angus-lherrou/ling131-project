sound\nA little peculiar but I always look for signs for there's something as important as a midterm election coming along powers looked for some sign and I went\nThrough this twenty sixteen and I remember very distinctly what happened I was looking for a sign that\nTrump was going to win\nAnd it was a if you remember no one gave him a chance I mean it was really silly how what was it Ninety two percent was the likelihood that Hillary was gonna win according to New York times and I kept looking for a sign\nI kept saying something's going to come along right before the election that is going to give me hope but he's got a chance of winning the other words if somebody's going to know something that we don't know and if you listen to my show in twenty six gene you remember what it was\nThere was a little blurb and the New York post reported that Hillary Clinton who was going to have her big victory celebration at the jet average convention center because of the big glass ceiling you know a woman breaking through the glass ceiling to be elected president of the United states and all of that\nShe had a fireworks display planned they were going to shoot off fireworks along the Hudson River after she claimed her inevitable victory and a couple of days before the election there was a little blurb for the New York post\nThat\n\nExplains that the Hillary campaign had quietly pulled the permits\nFor the fireworks display and cancelled the fireworks display and I read that you you are there I remember saying to you I think this is a sign I'm telling you this is a good sign\nThey know something they know how silly it is to order hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe millions of dollars worth of fireworks\nAs she could lose\nThe Hillary campaign know knew she could lose and of course we all know she did here's my little fireworks story two weeks before the midterm election President Trump's approval rating according to a brand new NBC Wall Street Journal poll is out\nIf the highest level that he's ever had in this poll\nIt's forty seven percent\nAnd there was a very intriguing aspect to that number\nPresident Trump's approval rating before the midterm elections\nIs now officially at a higher level then former President Obama's was ahead of used twenty ten midterm elections in other words\nPresident Trump is now more popular according to a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll that off the boat rock Obama was at the exact same time of both of their president Xi's\nLet that sink in let that sink in\nGoing to do something very similar to twenty six gene because frankly I there's a lot of objects that are the same there's a lot of the same things at stake this is a crucial election we must hold the house we must hold\nThe Senate and as we see this onslaught of thousands and thousands of migrants crashing through border fences and entering Mexico and threatening to invade the United states as we see this happening unfolding before our very eyes I like our chances\nAs we somehow saw Brett Kavanaugh get confirmed\nI like our chances as we see people yelling at a leader McConnell in a restaurant in lieu of all a guy screaming at him and disrupting his meal I like our chances as the media goes all in for the Democrats\nBut when they always do big raised in Texas Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz you got to hear this ABC reporter\nHere's an

they talk about the fact that this is a higher approval the Brock Obama had the Trump is more popular than I sing for just a moment if you believe and NBC Wall Street Journal poll\nYou wouldn't believe it from the media coverage but let that sink in that we are now we're witnessing a president more popular at this stage of his presidency than Iraq Obama you'd never get that\nFrom ABC NBC CBS

impressed with this partnership that we are proud to roll out with you know that's all coming up I promise a and you'll find out\nA as we do this or that a great call to action for you as well he has some concerns about this NBC\nWall Street journal poll which I think is very encouraging joined President Trump in a forty seven\nPercent rating higher than Obama was\nDuring this stage of his presidency and twenty ten Haiti's what's up\n[noise] hey thanks are called sure I'll just just occurred to me when you were talking about that that\nAre fully believe that Trump's poll numbers are all ordered bother Grammar Girl was over report it\nStarts in two thousand you're dealing with the Obamacare failure dealing with Ben Garvey and the Democrats got slaughtered in\nTerms of that concern you at all\nOh my gosh Ben guys who was a blip on the radar for the mainstream media are you kidding me\nThe only people that were covered Ben God's ... were were conservative media outlets that are that bothered or dared to go up against the Hillary narrative on that the media gave that big pass it was a giant yawn\nAn Obamacare for the mainstream media was a you know like a curing cancer\nGood thought that was the greatest thing in the world no not even not even a little bit no comparison\nNo comparison whatsoever here you'll get the polling numbers though and I I Want to go back to the story about this is really interesting analysis from that of all places CNN [noise] this is an analyst or analysis rather from a CNN reporter\nThe house forecast is that the Democrats win two hundred and twenty six seats\nAnd the house majority Republicans will only when two hundred nine seats the forecast percentage and this is a CNN talking now although we haven't generally presented a percent probability the model that we have\nShowing that Democrats hold the house I mean not take over the house\nIs about Seventy two percent chance\nSo Harry and to know Regina and says\nIt's not as if all hope his last Republicans indeed I Would point out that it's important to watch the margin of error it's still gives Republicans a decent chance of maintaining control again remembering that the model gives Democrats about Seventy two percent chance of winning control the house that's among the lower chances than most models give\nBut it's in the general ballpark he asks do you know who else had about Seventy two percent chance of winning\nYou guessed it Hillary in twenty sixteen\nHe says it's not too difficult to paint a scenario in which the Republicans maintain control of the house maintain control the house rather let's say Republicans with all those seats where they are favored as well as the streets were democratic candidates lead by about a point or less in the CNN forecast\nThat would leave Republicans with two hundred and twenty seats\nTo Democrats with two hundred and Fifteen seats\nSo to ... to rule out to say that\nThere is no no chance in hell that Republicans can control the house so it's not really accurate what even CNN says there's a scenario here\nMap suddenly tell our sponsors that you appreciate their support\nHis radio station militants on nine sixty patriot\nYou have questions let us be the answer nine sixty the patriots [noise]\nMorning or a America ... I'm not there is a dog that's what happens when you go to Pittsburgh I'm sure Bob friends will understand that he's sitting in for me today and beautiful Cleveland area that I go to Cleveland\nAnd Bob is doing damage because if he got in mind better Mayfield um early he hadn't been such a Sam Darnell family wouldn't be too for him on right now\nBlaming Bob for that but if he can turn around and getting the Senate back into your hands of the house things under control Kevin McCarthy all will be forgiven die from off your job thank you\nMy pleasure you do have a job for you well soon and Mr Hewitt a favor revise your fictional story way please about maker made me ill and Sam Ronald welcome our number\nThree by brand sitting in for you as he mentioned from the beautiful city of Cleveland, Ohio and the pain free willy factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer coming up in just a few minutes we are\nGoing to be chatting with Peter personnel who is a texting me right now and saying hey how are we still on I guess we're having a hard time getting in touch with him were having a bit of my phone number ... a issue perhaps\nUh but yeah we are um we're going to be the person I Want and it just a few moments he's a member of the United states commission on civil rights and uh he should be joining us shortly but apparently again we're having a phone number issue here so hopefully we can get that connected or sooner rather than later [noise]\nUm so are also coming up at the bottom of the hours we talk more about this caravan that is a steam rolling he is there okay good will get him in the second era but just to point out RJ home in a fair federation for American immigration reform\nIs going to be joining us at the bottom of this third and final hour the Hugh Hewitt programmed Peter Carson out my friend also in Cleveland, Ohio but by way of Washington D. C. much of the time where he serves\nAs the United states commissioner on civil rights being a good morning how are you sir\nI'm doing great\nGlad we're able to make this connection and a\n... I Want to play something for you very quickly and this was a part of a Fox News reports I'm from Mexico or just on the northern side of a ... with a Guatemala and I'm a reporter is talking to one of the ... one of the migrants are one of the invaders depending on your point of view\nAnd saying you can't claim asylum in the United states unless you are claiming persecution by your home countries government on the basis of one of of several things and those would be race religion nationality political opinion or social group\nSo if you can't credibly claim one of those things what is it that you're going to say when you get there and he was the response\nFriday all said man\nI don't know they're going to rally asked in a in a in in something so they can say I mean I Can't say we can go to school so they can apartment and they weren't as\nSo ... it's ... it's it's as plain as as the nose on your face they're saying essentially we don't have a claim to asylum we just want to go there and go to work we want to go there and take American Jobs\nAway from American citizens or from illegal immigrants legal residents in the United states and then we're going to repatriate the money back to our own country that we can't stand because we're leaving but were flying the flag 'cause we march northward anyway\nThey ... this is not about asylum there is no persecution and outdoors these people are just trying to circumvent immigration laws and come to the United states illegally\nIf that curve and consisted of journalists lawyers you know potential politicians or TV talk show host you can bet that wall would go up you know hurt the\nFact of the matter is that the vast majority of the legal immigrants are coming here for jobs or simply to take advantage of the system that is a track record will support the journalists tried to spin let's play identity politics for just a moment okay the progressives long\nLet's act like I Am a crafts\nYeah well you know kind of like that that has to do that okay [noise] um the fact of the matter is you and I've talked about this or the ... commission has conducted hearings who studies on this issue [noise] those\nMigrants as they're called who are coming up here which is truly an invading force on moss\nThe vast majority of them are military age males in Ninety percent of them I was looking very closely for the alleged families I didn't see I don't need to be harsh about the schools are just affects the journalist seemed to gloss over [noise]\nBut as we've shown on civil rights commission\nOf these individuals are going to be displacing low skilled American workers and what we found that the commission they use that one group most harshly affected by that displacement are black males blacks in general a black males and it's profound\nThat forty percent of the decline in the labor force participation rate among blacks over the last couple of decades is attributable to competition\nLow wage competition from illegal immigrants who tend to congregate in compete with lax in many of the industries that blacks have been historically concentrated switches construction service agriculture so on and so forth when you do the math on it and we have we're\nTalking about nearly one million jobs\nThat blacks have lost due to competition from blue waged\nIllegal immigrants not just to rest but illegal immigrants [noise] now\nIf that were to happen in any other circumstance you can just imagine what the outcry would be American citizens who are being harmed and if we play the game ... on identity politics it is one of the most vulnerable cohorts in America in terms of\nTheir status in society but we don't hear anything about that from the politicians will currently running for office the upcoming election and if you take a look at the Democratic party and their dependence on the black vote\nWe know that Ninety percent of the black vote traditionally goes to the Democratic candidate for president in the same was true with respect to other offices but ... percent\nAnd if you only peel away a couple of percentage points of view that a group from the Democratic\nParty then they effectively become as competitive as the weak part just a couple of points that's all it takes it doesn't require ten percent or Fifteen Percent and that's why the whole county West Germany brown who have a [noise] a cause so much consternation on the left because it was a boy\nIn the solid wall that the Democrats are progressive ... so that's simply you know if they want to do your identity politics this is a this is damaging to all of America\nBut particularly those favorite groups of the Democratic party and I would suggest that those favorite groups take a hard look at whether their interests are being protected by progressive\nPeter ... is our guest he is the is a a commission on the United states commission on civil rights Pete um you mentioned the wall and your first remark I'm about how fast it would go up if it were those other individuals coming to this country\nAt the wall is is a very interesting point here because correct me if I'm wrong even if we were to build this wall it would not stop what we're seeing right now now it would would stop those we're branching off from the caravan when it gets to our border\nAnd rather than going to our point of entry and it's just crossing the river or jumping over a a lame little barbed wire fence you know that we used to consider a barrier for a to stop immigration\nBut if they come that way yeah so what would stop that but all people would have to do is continue to go to the actual important point of entry which would be gaps in the wall and say asylum I'm claiming asylum you gotta let me and then you've got to let them let me lose 'cause you're not allowed to detain me or my family or my children\nWe found that out with the last caravan that came through or else is going to be a political price to pay a judge to tell you can't do that you gotta let me listen to the continental us and ah yeah I promise I'll come back from my uh for my asylum hearing which we know they don't do what wouldn't stop that would it be\n[noise] well it would I think present a a a symbolic barrier\nOr it would make things a little bit more difficult I think that it would no you're right they're presenting yourself at a\nQuarter century making asylum claim you seen that happened and again we started this with the civil rights commission that happens is you know where the three to four percent of people would turn for their hearing slips guns\nAnd disappear into the jury or the United states so President Trump is exactly right the blogs we'd be reformed they have to be more tells you a wall\nWill have a I Believe to be a significant impact let's just take a look at current events [noise] we had a migration similar to what we're\nWitnessing right now in Europe from Northern Africa in the middle east we had those huge chains of\n... migrants coming across southern Europe in Germany in other places and\nHungary said no we're not going to do this we're not going to accept this and they built eastern slope for lack of better term something more than ... percent something more akin to a wall and every wonder why it said it was going to be an effective well\nAssistance to free up the border patrol in others to engage in the border enforcement activities and I think that uh you know look he's got plenty resorted to do that that's without question\nAre there was a real question as to whether or not you know someone said well the goose a so called caravan that's coming in who knows how large will be by the time it reaches the border\nIs not really an invading force crusade or it doesn't have weapons but at what point does it become a threat to national security\nYou know many of us would argue it's really a threat to national security go to several thousand is that a a threat to national security is Fifteen thousand what about if it was just too low level what we saw in Europe where it's tens of thousands maybe a hundred thousand\nIf it's on the way it it's on the way by the way new Mexican news agencies now say that caravan is at fourteen thousand and it only started a short while ago when from two thousand uh fourteen thousand by the time it gets here you know several days from now 'cause they're still a thousand miles away Pete where we are going to be in the tens of thousands\nRight and do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered invading force official to which could uh uh justify the use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray area there but I think that\nIn the first instance the president added states commander in chief needs to do it's necessary to secure the poor to order\nA not a clue what was going to try and that it is indeed that Peter thank you so much Peter personnel us commission on civil rights for joining us twenty seven minutes after the hour by
