problem [noise]\nListening to it yet going\nI'm Dennis Springer and this is the male female our every Wednesday\nThe second hour of my show was devoted to what I Believe it's the most of us talking about men and women in the media at this time [noise]\nAs I often point out if it is not the most honest then I salute\nThose who are more of\nA time totally prepared to be in second place on this\nBut I I don't know where that might be found at this time and the reason is I don't have a male gender agenda or female agenda another man fan or a fan I'm a good people fan\nAnd there are just as many good manager good women and just as many awful medical ... that's just the way it is it's almost perfectly apportioned\nFor every foolish man there is a foolish woman and vice versa for every good man there was a good woman by and large by and large in some societies you will find more of one type than the other I think\nBut any in any event good people do grow on trees whether they're male or female my topic today\nIs the column that I Britain this week and it is largely about young men and the question of ambition\nOne of the things that renders men mass killing in the eyes of women or at least that was the case for all of history and I am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that perhaps for young women today it is not the case I Would love to get your input on that particular issue incidentally but\nBy and large one of the most appealing traits if I may say ... renders a man sexy if it's one of the things to a woman is ambition knocked\nCrazed ambitious miss narcissism no ambition I Want to get ahead I Want to be successful\nAnd ambition for all of western recorded history\nWas largely I Wish to succeed at work and I wish to provide for a wife and children and I wish to provide for a family this is one male ambition this is when I was certainly when I was a kid this was what was assumed it was so so much\nOf a given it wasn't even articulate it because it was just assumed will you grow up and be able to take care of her family that was male ambition\nAnd uh my sense is that that has been a killed for many young men because it has been killed\nIn the society the notion of raising men boys to be men first of all is it it believe it or not is almost considered\nArchaic today a be a man that is so sexist be a man or data show patriarchal or some others unbelievably destructive adjective useful\nThing for a boy to aspire to be a man what is a man a man takes care of the family\nThat is the primaries up the only thing that constitutes a man obviously but it is for most males that has been the defining element camp will I take care in all senses of the word we'll like take care of a family\nSo my assumption today is that this ambition has been shot first of all a lot of men from my generation to today even more so today\nWe talk that hey you don't have to take care of a family in fact you don't even have to have a family there's no real compelling reason for you to get married and if you do the female will pull her weight as they say she will\nWill hurt or just as much as you will roll your or you work all a boat\nWith two ... and so the notion that I as a male will need to take care of a family is is considered began patriarchal an archaic do you agree that's my question do you think that the the man of ambition\nI wished to get ahead I Wish to succeed uh I Wish to take care of a family that this is an endangered species I obviously acknowledge that they exist may exist even in significant numbers but I'm the question is proportion\nSo if you especially if you are a woman or if you have a daughter who is dating\nOr do you have a sense that this is taking place\nThat what I have described is in fact what is taking place or a this is an alarm that is not worthy of being sounded because it's not a big deal one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThese are the numbers to talk to me if you are dating if you have a son you might have a son for example who was not particularly ambitious who was a more than happy to stay at home and uh you know make a living but not not not really aspire to more I had the census I told you\nHours I mentioned I didn't tell you I mean let me let me lanes but it's my column this week is about\nMy wife and my experiences test driving vehicles last week at five different dealers in the Los Angeles area\nAnd my sense and they were all wonderful people there was this news no knock on them but my sense was that\nThese were not guys who were particularly ambitious particularly passionate about their work and you could say well maybe they're not passionate about selling cars here but it doesn't matter you still have to be passionate about\nYour work even if you don't care about the particulars because the more that you're passionate about your work the more successful you'll be and the more you will rise in life\nMy father wanted to be a doctor\nHe couldn't afford medical school so became an accountant he became extremely passionate about accounting which is about as far from being a doctor is you can get but he just decided to his great credit I'm going to become passionate about my work of all it's all too well at\nSome of the question on the table is ... young males and ambition now overly ambitious is not good overly anything if it's good to exercise it's not good to be addicted to marathons I mean there there's no end in life to the to the\nFact that any good thing can be over done\nSo I understand you can have too much ambition because then it's not ambition to take care of a family in an ambition to do good it's ambition to be to be super rich or to be super famous or to be super powerful and that's not\nThat it's not admirable that someone on talking about but the absence of ambition in men is in a mask you leading characteristic\nThey major part of masculinity is indeed ambition I Want to succeed I Want to take care of I Want to take care of and I want to take care of\nThat's a good thing and it and\nAnd in the past it has rendered men desirable to a woman\nBut I I Believe that society has played a terrible trick on both young men and young women hit us told them that they are at the same is told young women that they are sexually the same as men\nThey could enjoy any number of hookups just as much as ... there were most shuttle price paid and now what do you think why do you think that the idiocy of rape culture charge at colleges exists why do you think could exist it exists because so many young women have had sex that they later regretted\nSo rather than saying you know why did I get into it they prefer to use the term rape culture\nThat's that's the genesis of the a phony charges of rape culture and it's by the way this proves that it's a phony the proof is that parents and their daughters to college\nNo no parent in the world what's in the door to door rape culture I mean what are we do we joking do we ... what ... what are we living in the New York times\n\nWrites or we got that she wanted the teacher said\nOkay so he's so I gave her the examples\nOf the oh it was a female teacher it was a female teacher that was it was a female team okay go on go I Want to say\nSo I gave her the right I gave her the samples and she she stopped for a minute and she said oh my God you know why he said my heart than\nFeel this way when the certain shows any changes that channel and she took that poster down on and on and you\nKnow well that is that as an exceptional teacher and part of the reason I Am convinced is it South Carolina and it is not LA New York Chicago et cetera [noise]\nThat's a powerful story I wrote it down and I think you and Michelle San Diego California Dennis Prager Hi\nHi how are you\nWell thanks\nYeah alliance Alexa here and great\nFor taking my call so I think that kids today are really ...\nI think a lot for work and raising children I study in college that men and women are very excited and then I got married at ... at so and you know it's not true\nAnd I think that health care because you have a baby so stay on the campaign garlic and why didn't make her isn't really motivated to which it harder now than it used to be a\n... everything is now we have in common than love children are being raised by I'm not sure who are boys and girls after school programs and I think everybody listen\n[noise] well I think that that to a large extent except when you know obviously quite wealthy homes could afford a on a few ... or at least one and you know it can work but for the great majority of people I don't think it has worked particularly well\nI thank you for that and

America will be made America Again by having by having Democrats are in power to have a more of a a far more socialized economy as an example really All right so let's take some of the things he says in some of the things you\nDoesn't talk about\nThe begins what is left to say about the terrible murder of moderates Saudi journalist ... and its aftermath by the way I don't know if he was moderate or not and I don't know if it's relevant\nIf if the guy was moderate or not moderate\nOr what was done to him is disgusting we all agree on that one of the few things left there I couldn't agree with only one thing and I said it before but I feel it even more strongly now in the mid term elections vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to a voting station to vote for Democrats\n[noise] why does this have to do a well we'll we'll find out what this has to do with your Marcus jokey then he writes I don't say that because I'm particularly liberal\nOh really you're not particularly liberal\nThat's fascinating said why would you you're not even particularly liberal you you're not let alone leftist you're not even particularly liberal Tom Friedman but you want people to vote for Democrats campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for Democrats\nSo you want the left wing party to win but you're not particularly liberal\nOkay I just want you all to follow the logic here I'd want to shift the whole country the liberal agenda I say that because I'm particularly American I Want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy and politics\nReally the best of American values and and uh was was that it was that for example on display or when the when the rock Obama pulled out of Iraq\nWas that the best of American values and international policy was the shipping of billions of dollars to the Iranian regime\nWhich is worse W. O. R. S.

Democrats being behind this mail bomb story because now authorities say they have intercepted a device that was intended for the White House\nA suspicious package containing a pipe bomb that was addressed to the White House\nWas intercepted that joint joint base bowling in Washington DC law enforcement officials have told authorities a total ... told reporters\nAdding that this pipe bomb intended for the White House was similar to the ones to send to the homes of Obama Clinton and billionaire investor and major Democrat donor George Soros which was discovered earlier this week the devices appear to be rudimentary but functional\nThe White House addressed device also contained projectiles also moments ago the New York city police department are confirming that\nThe time Warner center in New York City where CNN has a bureau has been evacuated was not immediately clear who the package there was addressed to what CNN evacuated the newsroom as a precaution I'm also again the\nUnited States Secret Service edited intercepted too suspicious packages addressed to Obama and Clinton\nOr earlier this week so this is again this is why speculation as you're responsible it's not a just sit around and say now I mean what what does this do to your narrative that you think the Democrats are behind it\nUh I guess the if it's a Democrat who's behind this\nDo you think sending a package a pipe bomb to the White House um\nChanges that that that theory we have to be responsible\nLet the Democrats with their stupid wild speculation about Trump being behind the murder of ...\nA ... in the in the turkey constantly let them run their mouths and do all that kind of crap we we shouldn't we shouldn't do that and I don't believe we should speculate but obviously many people disagree with that's okay that's what we're here for eight hundred six five five Mike\nHere's Darrow on this breaking news story hey Darryl welcome to the Mike out of your show how are you\nAt your watch like pre shake stance on on the situation because it's very important that we don't get these people it's kind of credit because it's just\nA prominent party to a Democrat because the ex president former president and secretary\nIn the United States Senate crime against any former president all our highest ... from the United states crime against the people you know so and then and then we have to realize that one day out President Trump is one of the former president do we want things like that it happened it had\nYou know so we said we cannot allow them to be credited any party when they caught because at that point in a committed a crime and they should just be punished for that crime that they committed\nAnd it doesn't matter what your political affiliation is male one and I know how to write it does it does not matter of fact you're Daryl I appreciate very much it's kind of you I\nAgain I but I get the speculation I understand cynicism I understand I'm deeply skeptical way we're we're treating the ... the the the arena right now we're in the arena we're fighting the top of a tough battle\nAnd there's some nasty ugly vile stuff happening out there for crying out loud somebody through Boulder through a house majority leader Kevin McCarthy his office\nIn Bakersfield, California\nUm we've seen that the angry mobs and the and the the viciousness of people\nChasing people out of rooms but again this is this is not limited to Democrats Nancy Pelosi was harassed at some of them together day by a bunch of a loud mouth or angry people who were cursing at her and calling her name's may assure her out so\nAgain we got to just take a breath we got to take a step back\nAnd we need to be calm we need to be adults we need to be responsible\nAnd it's not responsible for the moment there is a a breaking news story like this of reports of pipe bombs being sent to the homes of the Clintons the Obamas but White House CNN shore Roche\nI've got a caller here Ron suggesting that these bombs are are are being sent to try to make the Democrats sympathetic\nWell then why would why would the evildoers why would the monster sending these send it to the White House\nChanges that narrative you just can't do that you you you just got to have a responsible reaction to this but listen we need to be about trying to understand what's happening we need to stay focused we need to know what the stakes are nobody is is going to vote or not vote because of her report a pipe bombs being sent\nAnd if Democrats win the midterms we could get more shocks like we saw in early October polarized politics of our day the mob tactics and the attacks on the president and his party have dominated the news\nI fear we've lost sight of the economic reasons to vote in November\nThe tax cuts passed last year and boosted every sector of economy Republicans want to pass another one which could extend those games for years\nDemocrats want to repeal the last one Republicans want to unleash business Democrats want to tighten the leash this election is on us if you're interested in a strong economy and a strong stock market you need to vote for growth policies

Missouri I it it is [noise] you know the loser he raised as slipped there is no other race it I think outside of North Dakota as has drawn a dramatic more dramatic effect\nA post on the Missouri which was one of my other stops I got out of there um and then I Would say of places are led Nevada but the place that it has I think the second biggest impact\nI take less so than in Arizona and Texas actually she was a whole as a whole separate ball game when I was talking about the time when I Would say Missouri and Nevada is where you could see steel here cow\nShed cruises actually coming up right after I think he's listening to you right now what did you find in Texas\n[noise] you know it's interesting and it's it's it's um there's clearly increased turnout is clearly ... increasing gauge Mitch ... and you see 'em\nBut that's a race to stabilize they don't want I I Would I Can't really put my head around is that what I what I compare I'm watching Beto O'Rourke running a red state as a Democrat and compared to here soon sit on my own Arizona\nCompanionship frankly Claire McCaskill of Missouri Bill Nelson of Florida journal mansion pile up what she'll read is that all of those other Senate Democrats I pointed out [noise]\nOut are making some play for the center [noise]\nUm what I find fascinating and this is the great experiment of this election\nIs is that a lot of work is it you know he's on a shit about is is is positions just progressive ideal uh on one hand it's made sure I think very clear choice between core listeners but it's probably the type of course a choice the cruise cruise a lot\nI was getting ready to say because it it is you know I think you could make a case that it's possible he could have been bought him a different way I'm just going at a while or kids excited the Democratic base of the taxes that I think it's a little bit bigger than I think any of us anticipated\nI I Can't you know part of me thinks Bush he ran a little more like Phil Bredesen my guest is Ted Cruz would would be would be look he's acting like he's nervous or you know a lot of money that's been raised ... planning it'd be more numbers\nI we're going to leave with their Chuck Todd and we'll see you tomorrow night on meet the press daily and of course but Sunday as ... I Hope I Hope we both get our boys so\nWe're just going to stay wherever you're going to\nTalk to the jak now we're to Ted Cruz senator from Texas you just heard what a Chuck said I think he's thinking betas runway ... do you think\nWe got ... with us Sen Cruz\nYeah I'm a I'm hearing you\nYour check what do you think\nI I think that's right I'm also glad to join the horse sports club like a two week that from election day and and anyone who spend their time doing politics at a little bit worse this right now\nThey are um he was saying they do is run hard left how can anyone run are left in Texas you get to that\n... you know that that has been a campaign from the beginning that typically in Texas Democrats at least at least pretend to go to the middle and from the very beginning\nA Beto O'Rourke made the decision to go far left he's running like Elizabeth Warren and he's running like\nBernie Sanders not what it results in here is meant the money he is the number one democratic fundraiser in the country ah last quarter a bed or walk raised thirty eight million dollars that is the most money ever raised in a single quarter by any candidate for US Senate in history\nUm that's a lot of money and and then what happens is every time walking braces a left wing position every time he comes out and calls for impeaching President Trump which he has\nMillions of dollars ... flood into the state every time they talked to a college she liked what she has\nMillions of dollars flooded to the state and I think in many ways he is playing\nThe shuttle liberal donors national liberal activists and and the people that he doesn't play to our our our actual\nVoters in Texas to care about jobs and care about securing the border and care about the constitution a heat IEDs responding to the interest of the people\nWithout Sen Cruz talked me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages at least one of them was a real bomb the president's condemned the vice presidents condemned that Rod Rosenstein I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either something not in the basement where it's a hospital power messing with our election but what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI look at it the media dealing with the media does which which any any narrative that they can twist against Trump will do so with the terrorists I mean ... this is terrorism and whoever the terrorists those needs to be caught you need to be prosecuted needs to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd a non profit it that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember some months ago\nUh we we had the bomber in Austin\nA that was setting up bombs throughout Austin and and I met with uh the ATF boats the FBI folks that were leading the passports and\nAt the federal law enforcement has for men to resources to put a to bear it to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I Know there I'm sure they're analyzing all of those now\nWhere cats just got to put it behind bars but but it is wrong violence is always role or wherever it occurs on the political spectrum light you know we saw tragically a year ago\nA craze gunman\nComing to Washington DC with the objective of shooting Republican Congress and and and ultimately go into the congressional baseball practice and\nAnd and shooting it nearly killing states beliefs and and as it should not be part of our political discourse disagreement is fine with even healthy to disagree on policy issues ah but but violence has no place in it and and and we need to be able to disagree with each other\nOutlets civility and with respect\nWell Senator Cruz you are cruising and that's great
