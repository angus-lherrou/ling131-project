haven't recognized the extraordinary accomplishments of the first twenty months got the two great pieces I have in front of me one by Fred Barnes over Weekly Standard and the other one by John Dempsey\nAbout how Trump has freed the Republican Party from the media I Want to start with a few I Want to start with a Fred Barnes piece over some facts because I like to argue with knowledge I Want to make sure that as you vote as you encourage your neighbors to vote as you get ready to go to the\nPolls don't believe the lie that somehow but rocked Obama\nSets the groundwork for this tremendous economy we're enjoying right now Fred Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're gonna posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it read Barnes rights but rock Obama is a proud men\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he ... to ... to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punched no surprise there either if the Democrats that won the election twenty sixteen Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted\nHe's referring before point two percent he's referring to the growth rate for the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation in tax cuts are system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct\nAbout the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening the shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of gross from down to up\nThat's what tax cuts deliver\nAnd tax hikes do not use the Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this lie that Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's proud man\nIt's kind of been during that he had such a head makes such a silly claim here are some facts ... Obama's successor Trump and the Republican Congress reverse Obama's policies\nThe fact is Obama had to struggle so hard to spur the economy and allow it to grow more than two percent a year that was the high watermark with Iraq Obama in the last quarter of Obama's presidency growth has slipped to one point five percent\nIt's obvious what Obama's problem was he had the wrong policies watch of wrong policies from the day Trump was elected\nWe've had a more real best robust economy\nNearly four million jobs have been added four million jobs unemployment is up to the lowest point in nearly a half century ... Barnes says let's compare what Obama did with Trump\nWhat he's doing Obama raised taxes Trump cut them Obama was where did you look tore zealots Trump is passionate about deregulation Obama's clean Power Plan killed the coal industry Trump is reviving it\nObama downgraded the role of entrepreneurs and free markets in boosting the economy and a lot of the wonderful things government does Obama's biggest biggest breakthrough as we know was\nThe Affordable CARE Act a big step toward a single payer government run health care system Trump got rid of the individual mandate that forced everyone to buy expensive insurance or be fined a big step toward a return to free markets in health care\nBill the entire Obama economic agenda was systematically reversed says economics writer Stephen Moore\nWhose new book Trump ... we've got to get even more and Arthur Laffer Lance on the show one of these days presidents loved to tell their achievements in Trump's case\nA White House report issued recently said is a bit of stretching had produced two hundred and eighty nine accomplishments in twenty months we all know Trump exaggerates and brags Fred Barnes rights but many of the economic gains more impressive\nEspecially the fact that job openings out number job seekers but the first time on record being liberal himself Obama relied on liberal economists they let him astray\nAs they did president John Kennedy in the Nineteen sixties they favored higher taxes to bay favored increase spending\nThose policies created an economic downturn but Kennedy was smarter than Obama\nGallagher I always hate it when the caller I Want to go to the most hangs up or get disconnected or whatever I had a caller who said you can't degrade what\nObama did for our country when he was president [noise]\nHe didn't say that I said that this economy that we're in joined in twenty eight team is not as a result of any of the rock Obama's policy just the opposite very important distinction sorry you didn't hang on should we do have had that exchanged who do you think\nThough that this migrant what party do you think benefits from this migrant care of in the Republican Party for the Democrats Laura things this will be good for the Democrats and bad for the Republicans like to find out what her thinking is on this how you doing Laura welcome to the Mike Gallagher show\nAnd gray how are ya\nI'm good thanks why do you think this will benefit the Democrats are not the Republicans\nWell I'm worried I don't think I'm getting worried because they're going to be a lot it killed there and and families and yeah I'm afraid it right the whole cannon ran out saying with the military there and [noise] ...\nYeah\nIt will be going out all this thing yeah yeah I I don't I think we're in a different time though Laura I really do guy who's just a different time where people are fed up I\nI don't under I don't hear a lot of people having a great amount of sympathy for thousands of people marching towards the United states it feels like an invasion even if there are children along with men and women where do we want to hear what the president had to say about it last night at his rockers rally\nIn Montana we've got the video and the audio we want to join us in my online dot com and joined us on air one eight hundred six five five my thanks for more coming up\n\nThe other problem with these fancy ... a tooth brushes that are electric they are they cost an arm and a leg they're very expensive and it's a pain in the neck to replace the the brush head which my doctor my doctor tells me all the time you got to replace them once a month sensitive sonic vibrations are available from the new quipped toothbrush\nQuip is amazing I Love quip I've I've read that quip but I found out and doing my due diligence they're backed up by over ... backed by over twenty thousand dental\nProfessionals equipped starts at just twenty five dollars and if you go to get ... dot com slash my G. you'll get your first rebuilt pack for free with a quip electric toothbrush now there's just quit Q.
