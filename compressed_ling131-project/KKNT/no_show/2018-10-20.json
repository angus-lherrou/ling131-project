Will try to get to your calls a quake worried about tobacco roared he's running behind and all the polls he's not going to be Ted Cruz in Texas and that's a good thing\nHowever he clearly right now is not running to win the Senate he's running for president and he assumes that if Iraq Obama can start presidential speculation when he's still only a state senator in Illinois before he's even been elected to the U.S Senate\nOr ... who's a member of the house of representatives forty six years old he he could just dodge the whole thing even if you lose\nAnd the Senate he's not giving away he's collected so much money it's over sixty million total just thirty eight million in the last quarter\nHe's broken all kinds of records for fundraising because people are very very inspired by his rhetoric last night he had a tough night very good at answering some questions but there was one question he was asked were the answer's gonna come back and bite him here's the question\nMy question would be a what would you say to Republicans and independents who are watching tonight and are contemplating about voting for you but are worried that\nShould you when your main objective as senator would be the trend impeach President Trump\nOK tough question\nRight because well let's listen to the way that uh the young Mr O'Rourke a Dodgers and waves and refuses to face it here's this direct answer\nI Want to tell everyone in this state regardless of your party affiliation or any other small difference that does not have to define us\nAt this moment that we can come together I Want to represent all of a it's why I'm here in the Rio Grande valley one of those for a lively democratic places\nIn the state if not the country um we can bank on your boat taken for granted but I keep coming back to communities like mecca on because I Want to hear your story and one incorporated into our campaign it's the same reason that I go\nHit us out west should amount and ... by the way he ramble on and on like this for literally about five minutes which out even touching the subject of impeachment and Dana Bash who's moderating for CNN which loves Beto\nSays wait a minute listen\nAnd he said in July ... you would as a member of the house right now though to impeach heavy changed your mind\nHaving 'em let let me let me put it this way I'm there may be an open question as to whether the president then the candidates sought to ... with the Russian government in two thousand and sixteen but to quote George Will very conservative\nColumnist when we saw him on that stage in Helsinki defending ... head of the country that attacked our democracy in twenty sixteen instead of this country and its citizens and it's amazing democracy was collusion inaction\nThere may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator and what happened in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation I Would say that's obstruction inaction\nOkay goes on and basically what he's saying is yes he would go back to the house of representatives if he if he does go back to the house of representatives a I'd be not planning on it he's planning to be elected Senate that won't happen up\nAs easing favors impeachment and I think that's political poison I I think it it means that any moderate who was thinking of voting for better or because Ted Cruz is very conservative\nOr forget it I ... honestly it at people out there things that do better or cause answering this question effectively look people who love the idea of impeachment they're gonna vote for him anyway\nBut why what is wrong congressman O'Rourke from getting an honest answer and saying look\nWe just want to find out the facts let the investigation work right now there is no evidence and there is none that should lead to charges of high crimes and misdemeanors and impeachment but let the investigation work next question\nInstead he goes out and lays out a case for impeachment now it's foolish let's go quickly to Ned Augusta, Georgia you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Trump's praise Greg Gianforte body slam was far more than unfortunate it was outrageous disgusting and once again confirmed his wretched character congressman Eric Swalwell summed it up perfectly vibes Irving that Trump\nBikes guys who harm reporters at home and abroad\nOkay here's my only point I think it is an appalling on it\nIt's it was stupid it was ... however\nIt was a passing thing he obviously and my problem with it is not that it was so outrageous it was that it was politically adapt in other words anybody who likes the idea of body slapping reporters are going to vote for Trump anyway\nYou don't need to win those votes he's got them collared I mean well to focus on the stuff that he did say it could lead some people to come over to the Republican side and that's exactly what we've got

about the ongoing politics of the moment of polling from around the\nCountry is very encouraging now I'd really is a they're a bunch of Senate races with really terrific people like over in Nevada a Dean Heller is just an outstanding guy he's one of the best US Senators he\nIs is solid and and all of a sudden Dean Heller is winning as race in Nevada now there is no way that the Democrats take the U.S Senate\nIf Dean Heller wins in Nevada if if you live anywhere near Nevada where they seem to have early voting this is such a clear fight and the advantages so clearly has gone to dean the most recent poll the Emerson poll\nOr in fact the only really reasonable shows how her up by seven points that's very good uh cruises up by more than that Arizona's a dead die\nAnd another great day and the greatest nation on God's green earth\nA great day to look at the most precious of all liberties [noise]\nThat is religious liberty\nAnd there's a case not here in the United states thank God but in hockey stunned\nDeserves some attention it seems to me [noise]\nWe were talking before because of Nikki Haley made a very profound point in fact maybe that's worth playing again [noise]\nA a Greg if we can because Nikki Haley's spoken the Al Smith dinner and her humor has gotten a lot of attention\nBut she also sent a serious message\nAnd the message was that one of the things that has\nTo happen in American politics is stopping the idea that if you disagree with somebody over a political issue that person with whom you disagree is necessarily evil\nThat is not true I Do not believe that the Democrats are in general evil and maybe some\nBut I Can't even think of any off hand who who's an evil Democrat don't call me on your nominations for an evil that rather ... deserves to lose actually I Hope that all of them lose this time they want all lose because we have a two party system in this country but the point about this is it there's a difference between evil\nAnd foolishness or even corruption and here's what a Nikki Haley had to say about this with the Al Smith dinner and she said it so well that well let's just have her say it herself\nWe've had some last and I can find at ourselves and our political rival\nSat really they want to share something I Believe is in Florida\nI say at a lot when I speak to high school students\nAnd the college kids\nAnd our toxic political environment\nAt her to some people in both parties describe their opponents\nAs enemies are evil\nAnd South Sudan or rape is routinely use as a weapon\nIn Syria where the dictator uses chemical weapons to murder innocent children\nIn North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier was tortured to death\nWe have\nIn the last two years I've seen truly evil\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\nOpponents are not even\nWe're left with the political system that allows us to resolve\nOur differences peacefully\nWe must recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that and particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb she's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what is her crime well\nHere is the other way it's described in the wall Street Journal [noise] um it it it turns out that are troubles began and again this is eight years ago with a squabble over a cup of water on a sweltering summer day in Punjab\nTo Muslim women accused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother a mother of five in fact they accused her of polluting the top that they were all drinking from on this hot day because she drank from it and she's not a Muslim\nSo in the midst of this argument allegedly ms ... told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your profit Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani law\nTo talk about blasphemy is blasphemy\nSo all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to cross examine the witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten she lives in a windowless cell there have been international efforts to free her\nAnd um [noise]\nIf it's just unbelievable they're already people who have died in her case a shortly after the span villagers accused ms Bebe of blasphemy and they had or imprison\nThe following year court sentenced or a death she lives in a windowless L. where she cooks for herself for fear of poisoning by prison staff or a fellow inmates against is bankrupt a standing up for his baby requires courage in Pakistan and two thousand eleven as a year after she was condemned\nThe governor of Punjab governor Solomon to fear\nOf visited her in prison to try to show some sympathy for her and right after that visit and his expression of support for us yeah bb his bodyguard killed him\nTwo months later a gunman killed Shabaab bought see that's another a Christian politician\nWho also opposed Pakistan's blasphemy law it's an unbelievable thing this is a nuclear power now why am I talking about this right now not only\nBecause there was attention to her case and there's a new president a puppy just on the among ... who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star\nAnd maybe just maybe he will show some mercy on this poor woman the problem is that President con\nSupports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed for saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um does your mom because she'll be incidents\n[noise] um what what happens next\nTier ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education\nThat has since been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously looking into whether the\nSchool district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay and so a ... in the\nBest case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother in Decatur, Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school it violated federal law and hold them accountable for that\nAnd to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working and it's causing harm like what happened to ... the daughter there are better solutions but the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa those are supposed to be private\nIntimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the the skated dictate Decatur school district it here\nOkay I'm speaking to match they matched sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who\nUm I give heart and soul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skill to this cause but everybody's in a position to give a donation and it's really important because right now\nEven with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington DC\nOr religious liberty is still under assault and it's under assault or by bureaucrats by local officials by school boards in many many different areas and right now you're on something of a winning streak over at ATF orange you\nWe have we've had some incredible wins from the Baker jak Philips to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently cheap Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one point two million dollar settlement after he was fired by the city of Atlanta for writing a book about his Christian beliefs okay\nBe part of this take part in it um maybe there is not that much we can do right now to save this poor Christian Woman who's been condemned\nTo death for blasphemy\nOr for talking about Jesus um but we certainly can defend people here right in the United states go to the alliance defending freedom a pen and you'll find that go to Michael med dot com\nClick on the banner at the top and right now we have a matching fund if you can find a hundred dollars to give to this cause it becomes two hundred dollars\nWe need to raise about thirty thousand more dollars and we're

seriously\nIt's hideous\nAnd and no Americans should even sing chest for a moment that it can be excuse let's go to your calls to a Alicia in Los Angeles Alicia you're on the Michael ...\nHigh then like the ... have really changed my life Oh thank you um [noise] we have a little situation here in Los Angeles where our daughter just went from competitive gymnastics the diving and the club is about I Would say ... around age twelve is\nHill about Seventeen or Eighteen upheld pre college they do the diving at UCLA on campus and they use their facilities and the lock around UCLA has a a a gender policy that is very open to everyone\nThere is a transgender boy and on the dive teams that uses the girls walk around and it was very startling when she came out of this hour one day when they were changing bathing suit\nAnd which she's twelve and I assume he's Nineteen\nYou know some of my daughters actually sixteen but at the age range is that the kids are about twelve to about Seventeen or Eighteen I think the boy and I think the boys sixteen the girl that change before getting into the pool and sour after\nSo so your your daughter was uncomfortable if that's what happened next\nWhen they finish diving and and that got out of the water is our heat within their showering girls and so instead of them calling debating sits down everyone kept bear baiting is that's an uncomfortable situation spoke with a UCLA title nine department and\nI assume he did not job he did not keep his bathing suit on\nI think the fed I she did not I think he ... his\nName okay and I still the stupidity here it's just so unnecessary so she spoke to the uh people at the diving program and what they say back to her\nWell we did actually as parents because they're free online ours are down they were very very shocked they have never experienced before she before and um anyway when they wound up addressing it with the rules for UCLA\nUCLA than than their guidelines that title like guidelines which says that they um they allow transgender to go where they identify\nWhich is the girl back around and\nOne of the girls as uncomfortable they will find out about holidays and all the girls\nHad any that very backwards and I don't know\nIf you would have said that that's exactly what when you say it's backwards is this is not to say that we should have no compassion are no support for people who have gender identity issues people who are transgender\nGot it and there should be a place for them but that should be a special place for them for people who have gender confusion or gender identity issues or our transgendered or however you want to say it\nBut the idea that that small number of people should be made completely comfortable at the expense of everybody else\nIs backwards and and again there is a possibility if if this is gonna be a serious issue then you have a separate time to shower or separate time to dress up if if you if your gender identity does not conform to um you are at the moment physiological identity and the entire thing\nIs madness I'm Sorry you've had to go through this with your daughter I Hope it works out and I hope she continues to

[noise]\nOkay um [noise] we that gets us back into this whole transgendered issue and we're not going to go there right now I'm another bit of political correctness I Can't believe it I you know dear Abby has continued despite the fact that Abigail Van Buren\nA desire to the column anymore the original dear Abby now and the call has been taken over by genes Philips who is the daughter of the original dear Abby but she was asked a question about a very complicated elaborate foreign sounding name\nThat someone was considering giving a child and dear Abby said this\nNot only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but they can also call a child calls a child to be teased on mercifully\nSometimes the name can be a problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful in a foreign language can be grating English by the way when I read that I immediately thought of of a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew name Israeli name is more on and a ... or more on I mean but seriously you don't want to name your daughter\nOr your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture they probably better named to choose now the point about this dear Abby thing is all hell has broken lose for dear Abby people have claimed that she is affirming white\nPrivilege that there is a racial thing and there's no racial and what she said\nBut of course the New York times is ready to make it racial\nThey have a column that says um [noise] the heated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American households for decades\nAnd was started by Mr Philips mother use the pen name Abigail Van Buren this heated reaction has inspired a fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism\nAbby's column was deeply infuriating and also revel Atari said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower Abby is clean to an old America were white\nIs considered the norm and everything else deviant and inferior Musk our added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and to connect them to that heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay that's fine and he was not suggesting that anyone is she's giving advice\nDo I think it's reasonable advice sure do we have very very dear friends who have given or their children very difficult names we do absolutely and you get used to it uh and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the name\nIf your children okay they named their kids after inanimate objects penny\nA river and Jonas but none of those names or that hard to spell or they'll I don't know may be probably people there are probably the blue smell penny wrong but not many uh okay that's the point about the point about this it it just seems to me\nIs why is everything about race well because people make it about race they a quote someone named a non\n... he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism he says is the reality that a lot of this has to do\nWith names but more with white miss\nThere are a lot of complicated names from polish in Russian and Italian and German background there will become second nature to Americans\nThe unusual names referred to in the dear Abby column aren't unique in their complexity he said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't white\nThat as nonsense\nI I mean I I think it's very difficult if ah if somebody and they are all kinds of names which could understand would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name is difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle ... ah ah his his name was ... and he changed his name to\n... more stuff and that was the way he did business because it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for bear is dogs and the Russian word for bears ms it yet so okay\nThis seems to me inane but then we have we have this and this is a piece in the Washington Post\nAs sexual assault survivors continue to share their stories marking worldwide have to ask me to reckoning actress Kristen Bell\nWho was one of the voices in frozen of course is publicly expressing concern about Snow White and the prince who kissed Snow White without consent\n[noise] a bell who provided voice of Princess Diana and Disney's animated film frozen\nTold parents magazine that when she reads Snow White two her two young daughters she poses the question [noise] don't you think that is weird with the press prince kisses Snow White\nWithout her permission [noise] because you cannot just someone if they're sleeping well she's not just leaving she supposedly\nOkay well you know as as Tim you're totally distorting things obviously the shooting at the at the baseball field was evil Maxine Waters made that comment about getting in people's faces months after that happened and after the shootout or\nAdd that lots of all along anyway I don't I don't have a liberal for years okay avenue admitted it kind of like okay\nAnd it caught me off on this I have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think about what happened that little girl that comes from politicians politicians are currently eagle gods now you don't have the gods now\nYou know guys now as evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look or Tim the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's the life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults but for people convicted of murder\nAs adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this that I think is profoundly wrong\nBut see we we lose the battle to him if we lose the language and evil loses all of its meaning if you were talking about silly stupid are irresponsible\nMaxine Waters and equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that uh Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you could argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different manner\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people hadn't and there were people of this nature\nOr Stalin was evil Hitler was evil so why is it that we sent millions of dollars billions of dollars worth of equipment and support and supplies to stall and so that he could beat Hitler answer because it was necessary for saving the world\nAnd uh there was one danger that was more immediate at the time that that happened

don't know anything about the guy that counts as a major so why would they send me your name\nIs ... I'm a journalist I Know how to fight it off and you can't have one foot and the eternal flames me to believe what you do you recognize there's nothing greater worse here from grand design connecting us all\nOkay is there a grand design connecting us all well you got to have to producer or there was a grand design behind this a series Stephen ...\nIs a veteran ... worked frequently with Will Smith in the past ah and I'm a and together with his partner Brian when Brent they're the co executive producers on God's friended me Stephen thanks very much for joining us\nYeah absolutely happened to be here thanks for having me\nI'm at the uh I I we don't want to spoil or I'm certainly not the ultimate spoiler but the the interesting premise here is that um that God has friended the main character who was an atheist\nAtheist son of a pastor that happens all the time uh and uh the uh the\nAtheist is commanded too by God to contact people who he helps at key moments in their lives do you um do you pay off what is really going on here\nFright tension psychological tension there some\nEvil evil psycho\nGet out of prison he wears a mask and implant cuddly and inexplicably he's going after people one of those people is played by a Jamie Lee Curtis she's playing Laurie Strode\nBut now she's a grandmother but determined not to let Michael Meyers newly escaped finishes job\nMichael my actually scraped who returned to his own I Need to protect my family is real and preparing for this problem with it is not safe to be on the street tonight\nIs a killer but he will be killed tonight happy Halloween like cool\nOkay happy Halloween to everybody by the way there's no ... or ... there is an implication in this film that Michael could be the Boogie Man but basically he uh he is a psycho with a back story in the back stories alluded to here also which is that he murdered his sister in the first film\nWhen he was six years old so it was a troubled guy um look if you like this kind of movie at all this is a terrifically well done\nWhat's interesting is John ... is one of the producers but the real guiding force is a younger director named David Gordon Green has directed a bunch of independent films and he'd pineapple express with Seth Rogen but nothing preparing you for the expertise of this one one of the things that is really astonishing about the film when you think about it\nIs it's incredibly creepy is very disturbing is the kind of film my wife would hate every minute of\nBut it does what the best horror films do is it gets you to forget about your own troubles whatever they may be I mean if you could think about politics from Albany are annoyed about uh the Senate race and the governor's race in California plenty of be annoyed about their\nUh and all of a sudden now you're thinking about wait a minute what's lurking behind that door that's been left the jar but the brilliance of the film is it is minimalist filmmaking this is not a body count movie there aren't that many people who get murdered and you don't see blood gushing forth with the big ...\nBlood it's subtle one of the most disturbing images in the film\nAt one point you don't know what's happened to a character and then you see someone\nDropping a bunch of removed bloody teeth on the floor\nAnd you can hear them wrestling on the floor\nIt's scary it's disturbing it's rated R A N Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding she plays a grandmother ... oh yeah Kyle Smith over a National Review\nSees this as of right wing movie because it's about certainly it's about gun rights I mean this part of what the film is about\nAnd it's about defending yourself and about how foolish it is to believe that the world is all full of sweetness and light and everyone is well intentioned there's also by the way of very surprising twist at the end involving one of the main characters and I won't even hint at it\nBecause the surprise when it comes to shocking to give away three stars for Halloween or by the way it it basically clears away all those other inferior sequels in the middle because it says in the film wait Michael Meyers has been in this\nInsane asylum for forty years said yup yup he has so all those other adventures in the other sequels forget about\nThis is the one\nThree stars for the R rated Halloween or let us go to element in Seattle Elmo you're on the Michael Mann that show\nMy garden yesterday I'm very well I Hope you are too and I hope you have a great weekend\nHere\nMichael I heard something today that really blew my mind and beyond you get a call ...

evil yeah yeah and I don't think Maxine as evil I've I've met her and by the way I Know I don't agree with her about\nAnything but she is one of those members of Congress that people say very nice

to\nDo so from these feminist columns in the Washington Post\nWhere ah in the first one that I read through from she is culture self middle age single heterosexual a feminist\nAnd she's never been so lonely in her life and that relations between men and women are or the worst that they've ever been which is right\nThe left has poisoned relations between blacks and whites between Hispanics and Anglos between men and women\nThe left is a destructive force in the human condition if this is not obvious to you it is because you are unwilling to see the obvious she doesn't see the biggest she doesn't make any connection between feminism and the fact that she is disgusted at the fact that the men I'll I'll I'll read it to you\nHere and\nThis is a A R situation I have it in my studio the Republican candidate for governor of California\nI Am not in my studio\nThat is the irony so he he is manning if that word is allowable for these days he's moving the uh\nThe home studio I Wish I were there with him in person but it doesn't matter what matters is that we're having a mom\nTo use again that the Republican candidate for governor of one of the most left wing states in the United states of America California and you would think\nThat it is a pretty quixotic task to to do that and you have to tell me John Cox soup up to the polls\nShow right now while they're showing them surging and by the way you have a very nice chair here ah Dennis I really appreciate that you know it's a very ... I Love your per se [laughter] [laughter]\nBut hurry back uh you know listen uh the the polls are surging uh we've cut the lead that he has and you know California is typically are people that make up their mind in the last couple of weeks or so\nYou go back to eighty two was du ... coming from behind a Pete Wilson and Nineteen Ninety four came from behind against Kathleen Brown\nA you know our message is getting out to the state is unaffordable for people of the housing crisis the gasoline prices\nThe water crisis uh schools that are forty seventh and the nation roads full of potholes and congestion yet we still have money to spend all your and your even mentioned the homeless and the homeless the tragedy that's going on in our cities they\nThey are but we have plenty of money for a train that that is going to serve three people that is hopelessly over budget and behind schedule a [noise] you know this state you just run down the list is hard to believe that Gavin Newsom is even competitive given the results in this state\nBut because the interest groups have spent a a literal fortune on him giving them all kinds of money for wall to wall TV ad that's what's ah putting you know Aaron under his wings but I think that's going to come down to earth and the last couple of weeks people gonna realize they really want some change here\nThe fact is that this is what's disconcerting you can't really get to the more to the left of Gavin Newsom his wife and I never I never picked on wives but she went public with this\nShe picks up her dog droppings we've a Trump poop bag and she had she put that on on Twitter she's proud of the fact\nThat she she uses the president of the United states image for dark fecal matter this this is the this is the new ... that is running but all the the wife of the new ... but this is all\nPolitical theater down as you know and of course you know that gets attention meanwhile our kids you know a half of our public school children are reading the grade level okay\nUh with you as you say we've got homeless on the street I talked to business people in Los Angeles and they tell me they are afraid to walk the sidewalks\nYou go to San Francisco and you need an app to figure out where the human waste is and uh you know you've got people that are just lying there on the ground that of course their answer only is free needles an injection of center [noise]\nYou've got all these real endemic problems on top of this they're telling us you know we live next to the largest body of water in in the world the Pacific ocean but they're telling us in three years weren't going to be limited the half the water that we've been used to or we're not going to take a bath in the state\nThese are huge huge issues and I get I get the the the ... bag with the president's picture on it but it's all fear we've got to get back to really giving all these people I only\nMentioned that because I think that that's indicative yeah ... ... of the moral state of the left and the uh the I agree with that yeah so let me talk to you about the water issue so are you advocating a de ... process in in California\nOf it there's a book called there shall be water by ... go which uh I'll Try and I it outlines how Israel turned a desert into a wonderful agricultural\nAnd by the way they Israel neither do it it was a national security issue for them that they could get their imports cut off any moment and they had to grow their own food what got tell ya we need to be able to grow our own food in California as well I mean obviously we have imports their Kimble now but\nIf we get into a war or\nYou know California is ah the producer of most of the nuts and fruits and vegetables for the entire country and in many parts of the world to and you know that that's a function of having water and we also need water to live in\nThe bathroom and you have to you didn't have to add fruits and vegetables you just could have said it's the producer of\nMost of the mill [laughter] that's a little bit of a double entendre I understand\nYes exactly by the way I I this is going to sound a little off to you but I my listeners no I'm Serious the very fact that you would advocate ... would be reason enough to vote for you\nWhen when I think of what is being spent on the train to know where you have met we could be the salad leaving water we have as you pointed out the biggest body of water on earth the entire length of this gigantic state called California and and we're told that we're that we're gonna have to\nA curb our bathing showering\nAnd people were male transforming their lawns into rock garden is it's a it's a disgrace\nAnd it's also created almost a third world in the Central Valley I mean there are so many people in the Central Valley that depend upon agriculture and water for their very livelihoods in living you know I mean\nThe other people in Silicon valley God love them uh uh doing wonderfully but you look in the Central Valley in Victor Davis Hanson is written about this very well uh yeah it's almost a third world has some of those spots and uh they're being starved of water and I tell them I\nI've been with so many farmers in this race so far who are just scared\nTo death of Gavin Newsom as governor or because they think they're going to their days will be number I I think that's true actually I'm I'm ...

S. because of a of Hitler\nAnd what they did was they said this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you set up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted a cash\nA and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the the organization had a rat line what Martin garden I call a rat line from Germany to Italy gentle way Italy where they got these ss guys down there and put 'em on boats and then they went where they went most of them to Argentina where the ... government was bribed\nTo allow them in and to keep them they're protected so the red cross out of Switzerland to help the ss so to the beginning CIA\nAnd soda elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic so all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in the book and then the track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat and they had to be badgered\nInto tracking down Eichmann in manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's no surprises all across the book individual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil which has been me much three since I was in high school so I I asked the Holocaust survivor men went through outfits\nThe rabbi Leon ... passed away and I I was with him for many many years and I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does he how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their sadism\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the the one thing that I truly remember from my interview and he said they were monsters which human faces do you subscribe to that theory\n[noise] capsule literally means is people didn't go to hell university and they and they warn people who were uh in prison for violent crimes they were

they do the most heinous evil things at any one could imagine [noise]\nAnd then after the war they go back to the towns and they take up their farming again\nIt's unbelievable and that's why I wanted to tell everyone and reads the book and every one that I Do these interviews with that evil exists in every person\nAnd you have to fight it you have to actively fight it or it can envelop you and if there's anything from killing the ss that's it\nQuiet because I'm I'm thinking in because I Want my audience to think about that [noise]\nAh so let me tell you something that I still audiences and I

[laughter]\nUh so they they raise ... ignorant kids\nAnd then they feel their minds with the belief that the Nazis or Republican so that's one of the reasons this book is so important you were talking about the Kavanaugh hearings go ahead\nAs an airline pilot and previous to being an airline pilot I was a flight instructor so I Would train\nStudent pilots on getting licenses I Would train private pilots on getting their instrument ratings or commercial licenses and so one of the things I've been coaching people whether it was on flying or\nPiloting an airplane and getting used safely from point a to point B or whether it's coaching now investors on how to build a proper financial plan I was astounded as a young advisor\nLearning from some great mentors at a real lack of true financial planning that went into your retirement I went in with his assumption especially as an airline pilot saying well the planet self and building the plant and pre flooding the airplane\nAnd looking at all of our way points and figuring out our course than what we're gonna do checking the weather the destination and along the route triple checking fuel levels looking at all of our tires walking around and doing a pre flight inspection like\nAll of these things you follow all these check with some flows as a pilot or have you know that but as an airline pilot when you get in the cockpit you have an entire flow and checklist you're working off of I don't care if you're a captain\nWho sixty three years old and it's been on that airplane for twenty five years with southwest on a seven thirty seven you are still going through the same checklist you have run for twenty five years now you could argue doesn't that person know already what the flow is they've done it thousands and thousands of times yes but we have to make sure that it's that thorough\nAnd there's checks and balances that's how important your flight plan is when you're going to safely take two hundred passengers or a hundred and fifty passengers from O'Hare to Phoenix it's that important and\nHow important are our financial lives of what you've worked for and safe for for your entire life well it's really important but unfortunately most of these advisors out there are not really financial planners or financial advisors their sales people and I couldn't believe the fact that most people had no roadmap\nThey were getting in the airplane at the gate with no check list just kind of saying well\nI think today it sounds good to go to Santa Fe I'm not really sure what the active runway as you get that sounds good to hop on the runway eleven it's bizarre and so I was adamant when I started Keystone we have to give people road maps we have to let them know where they sit today where they're headed and how they get there\nAnd we need to be able to evaluate along the course where we go identify where we're at\nAnd so today on the show I'm going to break down some of the things that need to be on your rode ... some of the things that you need to be considering most you already working with a financial advisor I Want to make sure that you can evaluate while I'm Talking to double check that you have\nThese things in place and that's my first question to you today it's real simple do you have a road map\nDo you have somewhere right now that's a written documented measurable to show you where you are to show you exactly how much money you'll have a different intervals of your life at their current course when you should take Social Security what are your expenses what's your risk or how much deviation from year to year\nCan you expect your account to go up and down by the week like\nTwo weeks ago where there was massive volatility were you prepared for that right that's just a thunderstorm rolling in above Houston at thirty five thousand feet you better be ready for that if it's July\nWe find a lot of people weren't a lot of people haven't even been taught about what happens when the thunder storm comes it they're just flying with the autopilot on\nEating ... cookies dipping them in their coffee up in the cockpit and then they're surprised when they run right through a cumulus cloud and everybody in the back goes flying up and down and their drinks are hitting the ceiling okay I get it I probably taking this analogy way too far from heaven way too much fun with this by the way I Wish you could see me here in the studio I'm\nI'm laughing and I've I've got a huge smile because I'm able to tie and some of my airline passion for this myth busting show it's way too much fun I Know I'm kind of rambling here but I Want to make sure that with your entire life savings you have a map in place and you know what you're doing it sounds trite it sounds simple\nAs I said earlier I think it's profound and its simplicity it seems pretty obvious that really with anything in life we need a roadmap not just with our money so why wouldn't you won a second opinion get this road map put together tailored for you\nCustomized for you we've done it for hundreds of people just like you hear a Keystone while partners we have offices in Chandler as well Scott still\nThis retirement map review is our one page road map that overviews your entire retirement situation and sometimes people are saying well John it's one page it sounds too simple\nThis is not too simple in fact for most of you it'll be the first time you've ever sat down with an independent\nFee based objective fiduciary or the financial advisor who is putting your needs about selling a product to get an understandable and a clear break down at like ... where you stand with your money ... let me go over again the value you get when you come in to meet with us it keeps them we will list your concerns and objectives right on the map\nAnd then put our recommendations on there as well to tell you what we think you should be doing to improve your situation\nAnd obviously you'd be the judge on whether you want to act upon those things additionally will provide your retirement income protection are you going to be OK in retirement we'll your income hold up and also\nAre you taking those income distribution in the most tax efficient manner possible maybe more importantly will help you answer the question what rate of return you need in retirement to accomplish their goals\nSomeone who needs a three percent right of return\nCan invest differently than someone who need seven and without having that knowledge\nIt's a very difficult for you to figure out\nHow much risk you should have will look at that you have too much risk not enough risk if an overweight scenario occurred what would that do to your retirement what did the rail it if a two thousand Seventeen happened where the market does phenomenal are capturing some of that growth\nWhat are your fees and expenses you recognize that most of what your pain is internal and hidden and unless someone shows you have no idea

seekers who are fed up with outdated financial advice on John ... or a foreign broker and it's my goal to reaffirm what you know to be true and to challenge the advice you may have been told is true and today we're talking about\nSomething that seems quite simple but so few people actually have\nAnd that is do you have a retirement roadmap do you have a written documented measurable financial plan that helps get from point a to point B and can be monitored and tracked\nAnd evaluated along the way if you don't visit us a key still well partners dot com and do what hundreds of others have done schedule your retirement map review and get a one page tailored customized personalize roadmap at one of our offices here Chandler or up in Scottsdale again at the Keystone wealth partners dot com\nRequest your retirement map review and it all starts with a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our advisors\nThat's what you're committing to when you go to our website a Fifteen minute chat with a credential produce you're related to your situation being talked about this a little bit earlier but when I transitioned from an airline pilots to a financial planner and I know you're sitting there thinking you went from an airline pilot to a financial planner that\nThat is an odd transition but that's what I did\nAnd I went in very naive into our industry I had these grand ideas of how it was going to help clients accomplish their goals and the planes that I was going to build for people and as I went in to the industry and I talked about this a little bit earlier on the show I was really quite amazed\nAt the lack of planning that was done the lack of advising was done you see right now there's three hundred and ten thousand financial advisors up\nLess than five percent of them are true for ... years not operating within the context of a broker dealer not selling products on behalf of their broker dealer\nBut truly acting as a fiduciary in the best interests of their clients that's a very small percentage you know like most of you when I started in the industry I sort of thought as a financial advisor I went in with this idea that\nWell all these financial advisors out there are obviously operating in their client's best interest have removed conflicts of interest build really good plans for their clients\nYou know kind of operate more like a CPA would from an advice standpoint for their clients and run a lot of numbers and build up a plan to talk to him about their progress\nAnd unfortunately that's the rarity in our industry\nUnfortunately most of you listening right now are working with financial sales people what is your credentialing do you have a masters green financial planning are you a CF P like do you have a PHD in economics or like like what's your area of expertise and they say well no I mean I Am an associate's degree in education and you're like oh wow but you throw it really awesome Christmas Party\nAnd you're a member of the country club and that's where you pick up all your clients you see most of our industry are just great gregarious dynamics sales people\nWho convince people to buy investments for them to make commissions and sometimes those investments are good I'm not saying\nEveryone out there is trying to do the wrong thing I mean a lot of these people their intentions are great\nBut they're not experts in financial planning they don't have any degrees or background and financial planning\nThey don't do any planning other than the bare minimum to induce a sale of something of some products it's going to pay them a bit commission and then there's very little monitoring of that along the way so since leaving my broker dealer I have dedicated my practice your Keystone\nAn oldie advisors that have joined me here a Keystone\nWe've all left banks broker dealers insurance companies\nMy whole goal was to pull back the curtain for main street Americans for you hard working people trying to save and do the best job\nWith your finances I just want to pull back the curtain on the industry and say\nThis is why the average American has made\nBarely over inflation I mean do you realize this the average American has barely outpaced inflation for the last Thirty years but according to ...\nThe average American Made about three point seven percent per year on their money for the last Thirty years while the S. and P. five hundred has made over eleven percent per year and why\nVery few of us had any sort of road map guiding what we're doing Bobbie and weaving and Swain with what ever or broker slash financial advisor comes up with this month\nWhat is your person been telling you the last couple of years has it been rooted in academics and discipline or has it been\nHey we kinda think this is going to happen with the market we like us stocks we kinda think small capital be good international doesn't seem to be doing well values really been lagging behind so we're going to is there a strategy in place or is it what they think is good today\nIs there a map in place is there an altitude put in is it being monitored and if you're even slightly unsure about the answer to that question\nDo the Keystone while partners dot com and request to retire map are you a member of my team will call you Monday morning and schedule a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our advisors if at the end of that phone call makes cents mutually for us to do retire ... preview for you we will build outta customize a one page roadmap that's completely complimentary comes with no obligation\nAnd will meet with you and sit down at one of our officers either in Chandler Scottsdale to go through that what you just as we've done for hundreds of others\nWe address all the major components of your financial plan on that understandable one page break down\nAnd you can request that again by going to Keystone well partners dot com now what are the important things that you need
