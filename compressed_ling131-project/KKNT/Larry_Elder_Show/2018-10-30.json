murders on Saturday and I said and when it comes to religion and God I'll leave them more to Dennis but I Do know politics and government\nAnd I do know that we keep jumping over our guard rails which swept the left and the Democrats and the media do when you find someone guilty without corroborating witnesses or you go back\nTo high school to examine teenage brain have your or you don't allow people you disagree with their free speech or when our press leaves their objectivity behind and adopts the agenda of one of the parties they agree with so I Want to follow up with what I began with when I filled in on the Larry Elder show on friday\nWe started with comments about the would be bomber's arrest I don't want to use his name to give them any publicity but how the media how to use that to pile on President Trump held a along with the Democrats and the left all all the same thing these days to claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse\nAnd I have to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer me except for what I'm kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial can you imagine the outcry and the further device on this if that's even possible mature that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that the ... legitimate discussion to have about whether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption of the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for actions and the cries to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people wanted him to go you know he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so black corrupt is not by any means and incitement to violence\nThe other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people there'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they're beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nPress not infrequently comes out with stores that are not true the latest example here this one NBC was hiding expose Qatari evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's one it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that you didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engaging gain gray right you didn't hear that John\nI think I got something on Johnny didn't hear that better news yeah this so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters\nTo media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so if they're no longer objective reporters and a ... of the left which they have to come\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nTo the to the detriment of the truth so for example well talk about on the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if a mother's didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime catch this that children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father [noise]\nHow come that hardly ever porn or by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener\nSo the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she lives on Fox folks use even though he more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lacked the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank account they just don't have the right documents so of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports and so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own\nDecisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right he's not even let me know what you're saying what a ... mark guys for Dennis [noise]\nI Can't believe the holidays are almost here again well\nThat's not all
