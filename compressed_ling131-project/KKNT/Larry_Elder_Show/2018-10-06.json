time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point given that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nTo conform Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin demographic West Virginia\nWho is a Republican and waiting at this point in the midst of all it seems like it's inevitable at

were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on promote point up optimism throughout this process\nIs the positives that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew

of the more interesting moments during the course of her fifty fifty five minutes speech earlier today which I guess it was\nI Believe the best be finest\nI have ever witnessed the United states senator delivered I just incredible incredible definitely something worth your while if you did not catch it early early early earlier today easy for me to say by the way I buy in for the gray one more call to your friend here in South Florida\nI Do a morning show on WGN out west Palm Beach a mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and always an honor and a pleasure to be here with you know one of the things about Susan Collins during the course of her dissertation\nYou might have found some moments where you're wondering huh\nBecause Brett Kavanaugh really the conservative I thought he was he really the constitutional aside I thought he was not so sure I mean that was held good her depiction of Brett Kavanaugh was how thorough investigation was\nOlder folks she interviewed I mean she laid it all out there just remarkable and uh you know it might have some some questions about how he would end up rolling on things like\nSay for life matters and there is an important point within the pro life conversation here as well\nBrett Kavanaugh pretty evident being the good Catholic Boy that he is he's pro life right but does that necessarily mean that he brings that philosophy\nTo the bench and doesn't doesn't necessarily it hasn't as she pointed out based upon or some of what he has ruled on and faded previously\nAnd we were travelling down this process you're learning things that you never would have otherwise known about Brett ... about\nThe level of the investigation that took place with Susan but also what obviously was not done by so many other senators and this is where it's instructive\nFor you with the folks that are in your neck of the woods you are senators hounded ... vote I'm here in Florida Marco Rubio you voted in favor of in the debate today will vote for Brett Kavanaugh out tomorrow Bill Nelson he voted no\nBy all accounts will vote no again tomorrow night he happens to be up for reelection this year he's up against our term limited governor Rick Scott who has been no less than the third best governor\nDuring his seven plus years as governor and the state of Florida just remarkable what he's done\nA but he's in a real horse race against Bill Nelson who's already served three terms in the United States Senate in Florida it's going to be fascinating to see how this Kavanaugh thing plays out here\nWhat I'm looking at not had a bunch of people asked me this during the course of the way could I don't know the answer yet I'm Still trying to figure this out is this an inflection point in American history everything we're going through right now\nSo I Do these weekly series for my local shows and it's all about where we are politically based upon historical analysis\nAnd for the midterm elections I'll give you the Reader's Digest version we tend to be incredibly incredibly predictable in terms of political swings in this country the issues change the politician strange times change\nBut we have been incredibly incredibly consistent in our decision making a walk you back real quick to the president's election twenty six team\nI've done this for years for years are going back to the two thousand cycle but it was most notable in twenty sixteen when I was able to effectively and accurately depict Donald Trump winning the presidency\nBased upon the electoral college and then when I was able to do it just based upon historical trends\nSimply put you take a look at history back in ah twenty six team we had a full term Democrat who was president\nThere has still to this point in American history never been a full term Democrat who was succeeded by an elected Democrat not ever\nAfter eight years we tend to have enough the only time it has ever happened many Democrats to see today full term Democrat was Truman after FDR he inherited the office ESE later ran as the incumbent and one\nBut because of that we tend to be incredibly consistent and all during the primary process\nEspecially here in Florida folks were asking me with Rubio running you know is that Rubio more electable Trump's winning this can't be good\nAnd that ... vote for the person you believe in because the odds are the Republican candidate will win and sure enough there\nYou go now in the context of mid term elections you're probably aware that the incumbent president's party loses generally in fact there was only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifty is\nThat the incumbent president party has actually gained seats only three times and they each happened with an inflection point in American history the first time was Nineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had the bill Clinton botched impeachment effort by Republicans\nBush employ American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush in the wake of nine eleven so it took the great depression nine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in mid term cycles that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happen this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats and Republicans\nAre almost certainly at this point going to\nYou retain control the Senate map favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was like oh there'd be a no vote\nAbout ten points about ten point to what the what the difference in her race North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted yes Joe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be reelected I'm back at this\nAgain when I've been taking a look at for ... how much this boat meant and those particular states\nAn average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump\nBroke Kavanaugh states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to say but still the house you take all again if you check any of the polls he checked decide to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are pacing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty lawsuits which will be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nAnd my question is and this is what I'm working out because the un I base everything off of information\nAre we had an inflection point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being being disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this cabinet situation is that now I guess to what we went through and any of those other examples\nNot the great depression\nNot after nine eleven but if you're looking for a cop you absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight ... there are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president and well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton but then again he actually\nIsn't specifically the issue here except that they made him the issue right we've had the ... investigation we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house that could be analogous you throw Kevin on the mix maybe that is too\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen if there were a red wave that came out of this right now if you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump\nBecause of the economy because of the progress or maybe because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh eagle wind seven percent in the first hour\nI mentioned that in this entire Kavanaugh brought this entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and when you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into butter enthusiasm bison that\nBut it absolutely has the potential and this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote but you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all they are and the point in the in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you are in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike does\nAngry people that were paid and and showing that Joe mansion it's going to win the hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to win hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd uh by the way I Want to give me a

presumption of guilt being the new way but we do things here in this country and\nCould you imagine could you imagine how embolden people would be not just towards politicians but again if somebody got sideways with you at work somebody got sideways with your kids to school I mean that's what's at stake here so much more\n... than I Am your friend here in South Florida by a morning show in a West Palm beach W.

R. you'll be in Miami and it is always an honor and a pleasure to be able to a pinch it and and fill in for the great one more call them\nBy the way the audio there that you just heard that was Ron dissent is Republican gubernatorial candidate and now my buddy from Fox News radio Evan brown on the best in the business caught up with a Ron earlier today and and sent me that clip\nIt is a bell so much more as Ron correctly pointed out there's something else involving ... Santos and this is something that he played out around the state yesterday but it's something that is a bigger issue for every body for every body\nMarched ad Jacqueline got a new book our police beautiful book\nAnd it's a illustrate it's perfect for your kids grandkids our please go ahead and and do the pre ordering do it on Amazon and if you don't do it by the end of the show I Am bound to activate Alexa in and make elect to do it for you so our police by Jack London\nWhat's going on with the police in this country and and yeah I Know what happened in Illinois today and and my my dad always said that there\nAre few people worse than the backup but few people you'll ever find that are better than good cops and we have hundreds of thousands of good cops every day but go to work and make it happen and that have to deal\nWith the crap that is thrown their way by our media and by so many that want to use them for political purposes you think about it we go to work every day we're talking about oh we got to deal with the ball so we got this meeting those are our big problems\nWhen you're a cop and you put on that bad she can go to work out of their biggest problems we have\nThe luxury of being a man I really don't want to go this meeting today because they put on their badge and they put their lives on the line that is what's on the line here in this country and look at all the attention that bad cup\nBest convicted gifts\nBut what you don't hear about\nFolks that sacrifice everything and there was something that happened here yesterday\nThat criminalizes fits perfectly for the entire country now the sun sentinel to give me an idea of just in the grand scheme of awful where they stand\nOne of their a major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday\nPolice shooting in endorses Republican Rwanda Santa's for governor forty years after endorsing Democrat right\nLikes or from the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago before\nThe PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor\nCharlie Crist anyways they\nLump people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently as a Democrat but as a serving now the saint Pete area but\nAh anyway what's the last time my he actually was a Republican governor and the in Florida Rubio ran him out of the party what happened anyway I'm\nContinuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement of dissent is the PBA president said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies quote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell Floridians that Iran does say that this\nHas our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back to the for the PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years some of the quote from the president of the border police benevolent association\nAs we've seen in the past few years police had been scrutinized for doing their jobs have kicked to the curb by special interest groups media and politicians whichever resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said\nAnd the my blood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to this pose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalists that wrote this garbage for the sun ... he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down by morning show yesterday\nI think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mothers to their children in the car\nYou know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over and part of what made me so upset I noticed what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look and and I was tracking\nViolence towards police officers remember before the whole Kaepernick thing even you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country and I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida\nThat tracks the violence against police officers\nAnd here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he did not for example ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance\nBut here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here\nSince twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three\nTo say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed pretty forty\nKilled and until this week\nWe had in business the audacity of this person writing this article and forward about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers died line of duty in Florida than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes it is it specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in the police being killed or assaulted\nAccording to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand or dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad\nThing right and then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the implications\nVehicle occasions when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we tried to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay to bring the refugees into the United states average cost tends to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies the typical immigrant guess what happened to or they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five year cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks now you're ready\nTo hear how much it cost to relocate a refugee into a safe zone if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate but only sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed does that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that orange skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\n[noise] something that's never discussed back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire we said no but it absolutely is part of the reason\nPeople automatically suggest that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost to import people in sick competed against the most vulnerable in our society\nReally cared about the most vulnerable in society\nYou give them the opportunity\nFor Donald Trump is doing\nHis policy\nWhole mission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media [noise]\nTwo sides to stories on one side of the fact I'm Ryan ... for the right one go the\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect the optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them optimal got the Irish to designate Nathaniel ... case as the and the status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here optimal kept finding on Nathaniel spy happen till the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands to resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings and paychecks that need protection they resolved over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back\nTaxes to the Irish call my friends that optimal tax relief\nEight hundred for nine Ninety
