later on but as toward Thursday's hearing Senator Graham said this\nQuarter they don't want to talk what's the latest on a kind of do she Asians over having just hearing what issues have been settled what those are still outstanding and how close are you getting fed up with a witness dictating to the committee the terms of her testimony\nOr a chairman Grassley has been bent over backwards to make this happened they offer is Thursday at ten o'clock\nShe may ten condition store lawyer wakes up at six we're not going to turn over to the other side uh how many witnesses scholar to it and it says

... because you can't tell the court or what time it happened and where it happened and if they tried to get award based on this she couldn't get a warrant because that three people named by Dr Ford as having been at the party outsider cabin I'll say they don't know what she's talking about\nSo you couldn't go to criminal trial you could ensue civil\nLate you could name get a war but I Will listen to what she has to say\nHow about uh how about the race card\nSince Senate wants to smear Dr Ford they just don't want to get their hands dirty doing it right this is not a search for the truth

of him being the use of conspiracy theories all last week what the Senate Republicans desperately want to do is to find some way to say that well Christine\nFord is a ... because they know that makes them look bad but we still believe Brett Kavanaugh when the reality for them as they just ... capital no matter what they're not interested in finding any reason not to believe that right\nSo this is

radio\nBar called her\nThem inside these armed American radio frost free pollster studios wow what a week\nHuh [laughter] food water a week\nSo much to talk about today and we're going to get into a whole bunch of it with my guest by up today I'll go over that and just a second\nBut we're going to cover everything you are thinking ... stuff you're not thinking about and we're going to buy a whole bunch of stuff up for you that you didn't even know need\nTied up both time together but we're going to do it for you because that's what we do here on armed American radio but first I think it's important that we cover a little bit of ground here okay because as gun owners you meet\nWe're steps ahead of you had a whole lot smarter than the average bear right blue\nExplain what I'm Talking about here\nHave you ever seen anything like what you saw last week\nOf course I'm Talking about the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court judiciary hearing over the past couple of weeks in particular Thursday and friday right have you ever seen anything like that look sadly I'm all of a three member board being ...\nAnd the sordid Anita Hill Clarence Thomas fiasco I'm old enough to remember that like it was yesterday and it seems like it\nWhile they were both both of those incidents were disgusting and their own right nothing in my book in my estimation anyway comes close to the charade that we saw with Kavanaugh but just my opinion\nWhich when you looked at everything to any intellectually honest human being was clearly and obviously an orchestrated and well executed charade by the Democrats on the committee working in lock step together\nAnd more than likely not just them on the committee behind the scenes they were working with some help from New York's finest Chuck Schumer and others thanks again for that to New York by the way you still can't find anybody better\nThan Chuck Schumer after all these years it just amazes me I amazes me\nSo to sidetracked or just a second before I go back to that while there are a number of things that I think are wrong with what we witnessed this past week\nI Believe it was a Democrat Patrick Leahy I'm pretty sure it was lady who highlighted a huge part of this problem with the committee in the process that we're witnessing in what really is wrong with Washington in general when he said and I'm going to quote here I remember him saying I've been sitting on this committee\nFor forty four years yeah I mean he's a huge part of the problem you shouldn't even\nBe in Washington for forty four years let alone on that committee I was twelve years old when that clown\nElected and I'm fifty six remind you can't find anybody else to do this job and well he's not alone there are other Republicans Democrats every one of them from either party and there are the posters for term limits but I digress\nForty four athlete radio moment word years on that committee that there I you know that makes you it puts things in perspective for you when we get back to Capitol\nWhat we witnessed this week has to be a wake up call to all conservatives and in particular you gun owner and here's why\nYou gotta ask yourself some questions you I'm gonna do it for you and make you think that you put your thinking caps on today what does this mean process we witnessed over the past couple of weeks and worst Thursday and friday have to do with guns\nIt has repeat after me everything to do with guns and many other things but for the purpose of this program will stick to our guns right pun intended\nIt has everything to do with our guns see this this debacle was one hundred percent predictable in my estimation you combine and unhinged hateful left something we're very familiar with his gun owners right\nYou combine that unhinged hateful left with the loss of a Supreme Court seat that will will will not may let me rephrase that\nThat will not may but will destroy their house of cards progressive politically correct dream for the destruction of America as we've known her for the last two and a half centuries yeah this was absolutely predictable\nAbsolutely predictable what does this have to do with your guns every part of it what you've seen is just the taste of what the unhinged lunatic left will do to you\nWhen it comes to your gun rights you personally given the opportunity how do we know this so walk with me here\nOf course these people think you're stupid Feinstein prime example let's go to the Feinstein right how many I could pick as a ... billion examples over the last few weeks but for example five cent she thinks you're stupid enough to believe that she didn't leak the information she had from Kavanaugh's accuser boss a Ford\nAfter sitting on it for weeks minds you she thinks you're stupid enough to believe that she didn't leak it because she turned to her staff in front of cameras and ask did you did you get and when they said no\nShe actually with a straight face turn to the cameras didn't do it to the chairman instead so so I asked my staff in and they didn't leak it no we didn't make it look this of course is the very same person who would tell you she doesn't want your firearms taken from you owe she has done that hasn't she after saying\nIf I could Mr if I could have done it Mr and Mrs America\nTurn them all in fifty one vote I Would have done it\nShe plays you for a fool but let's give let's\nHave some fun let's give the gum prohibition is the benefit of the doubt here just for a second\nIn order for me to be right with what I just told you we would have to believe that someone like Feinstein would be willing to um I don't know say demonize say semi auto rifle and make up a name for it like\nGee I don't know maybe call it an assault rifle and then apply that made up term to a whole class of weapons that she doesn't know anything about or\nThen she would have to be capable of spending every waking moment in her way too many years in office in her career attempting to ban those guns all while telling you she doesn't want to ban guns\nJust assault rifles because they have no place on our street see no I Know that is true [laughter] right\n[laughter] I can do a straight face but something like that would actually have to happen for me to be right you're following beer\nMaybe maybe she would be capable of or the folks out there on the prohibition would have to be capable of oh I don't know referring to their gun control schemes as I don't know what can we caught a gun safety reform right maybe ally like that or maybe they would I don't know um\n[noise] maybe demonized the national Rifle Association and millions of members by creating a narrative that the n._r._a. and its members are a murders\nAnd standing in the way\nOf their noble attempt at gun safety reform all of us murder you know they would have to be capable of crazy stuff like that I Know it's hard to believe they would do that but I'm just saying so besides the obvious here that Kavanaugh is a strong supporter of gun rights\nThat they hate so much\nAnd would likely they know would likely rule in favor of expanding gun rights based on his previous history and some of his own words and some of his older than in his own writing it easy to understand why the left is doing what they're doing and\nThen why it represents such a threat threat that they are determined the one that they determine is worthy of complete and utter destruction of a human being and his family and everything else they don't care\nOut of destruction in their last ditch effort to stop any threat to their agenda Kevin I was just in their way\nThat's all owing you the gun owner\nYou are just as much of a threat\nAnd I'm going to go on a limb and say you're even more of a threat than Kavanaugh they believe Kavanaugh would protect you that makes you more dangerous than Kavanaugh in their estimation\nAllen is their light at the end of this tunnel I mean I'd ask you this before but\nIs scary stuff because what you've said is absolutely one hundred percent true when you cannot compromise with somebody that ... that says to who believes that compromise means agree with me or\nSatellite radio moment where you you cannot sit down and talk to people like that rationally they will not work with you they will do anything\nThey can tell you anything you want to hear to get through to it I think Lindsey Graham had an epiphany I think Lindsey Graham finally realize I think those friends over there then I called friends would do that to me too if they had an opportunity I think he saw that we've seen it for years is there any light at the end of this tunnel can we get out of this\n[noise] so I think the lightning and the tunnel is a temporary like none of them get judged capital out for\nA I'm I'm Still can be as he's going to get confirmed to the Supreme Court ah what is this going to make ... is the other side going to start dealing like statesmen instead of like political ...\nNo way Jose it's like it happened and when it comes to gun rights and we ... they ... they should kick into the streets you know when they want your bank something a bit so that you don't have insurance companies right policies for you\nThey want your products off the shelf or the demonization it it's going to get worse it's not going to get better I'm just hoping that our site can can be temperate criticism and have a good temperament and and not adopted tactics all the other side\nI think there can be productive in the long run I ... I think all of us have much to have a debate facts and and some critics rather emotional barricades and and eating garbage uh\nBut but I don't think you get to see the other side change I think using it can it get worse especially as they lose\nHow can we debate anything though I I got to ask this question how can we debate anything because to me you know me very well to me to the debate ended in Seventeen Ninety One\nOn December nineteenth but having said that I'm Talking ... the the debate over the second amendment of course and it's ratification but the fact of the matter is we can't compromise we don't want to compromise we can we wouldn't anyway but we can't debate with somebody who is willing to who's going to use the media to destroy us\nSo what options do we have left\nWalking I Can't say we can't compromise I mean I wanted to get right off half the gun laws on the books today right up next year there you go [laughter] I'll take that [laughter]\n[laughter] I mean is it all depends on how you define compromise said goodbye or give up our rights I defined as getting back you know a little at a time maybe but getting him back\nSo\nWhen the fight and and unfortunately we just witnessed what we're up against and the death of depressed if people will go to ... I mean there is no so these people will step on and destroy anybody it's just simply a means to an end\nTo these folks absolutely incredible how and when we come back some of the things I Want to I Want to get with you on you got a great piece out called don't criminal I self defense that was wonderful I Want you to tell us about it because you were one of three people selected\nTo right there

California but at the same time he vetoed a couple of measures that I Would have put money on in Vegas that he would have side and when he was asked why he veto he sounded said with his response which made me question why he signed the other ones\nTo begin with you know Jerry Brown and I think you'll be able\nTo shed some light on it for us and we've got a couple of other things I Want to talk with

G. and I'll forward some of the best ones over to Alan and we'll get some response on them because I I don't I I really do I think you I think he might have sparked a really really fun conversation there\nHere's what I can say about this I Know who you're talking about in California looks just assume for the sake of argument it's Gavin Newsom that wins the election Gavin Newsom is going to not only signed everything that comes across his desk is going to propose them as you said that he's going to actively work to see to it that the legislature passes that he's going to be an activist\nIn addition would never have vetoed the two recent pieces of legislation that Jerry Brown adjusted dead and I'll tell you what I think Alan if I Want to get your comment here\nI think the most telling part of the LA Times piece that I saw was and I quote the Democratic governor followed the lead of Republican Florida governor Rick Scott who in March signed into law a bill raising the minimum age for buying long guns because that was one of the bill each side\nThat gave me pause I predicted it when it happened that you're gonna see Democrats use it and the LA Times just did we have more to fear from that don't we\n[noise] well yeah part of the initiative sixteen thirty nine and Washington state also razor you age uh from you know to Twenty one to buy a rifle and not just a an assault weapon but any semi automatic rifle period\n[noise] yeah well he was supposed to talk about the two things that Governor brown\nIn California vetoed that I don't think he's going to see the light of day in Washington unfortunately I'm In that is the one I think it was one gun a month he vetoed that and he vetoed a second one I forget which one it was but he said that was\nWhat on as an extremist potentially a order that start to take people guns away to expand it further than it already is in California\nUm that that would that would that would lead to a yeah chaos and it and and also to accusations and felt that it was a real problem in the ... you didn't need a new\nYeah he said and I quote in all of the person's name talking about gun violence prevention of restraining orders whatever they call\nA extreme risk protection orders or post here's a quote governor ... all of the person's named in this bill can seek a gun violence restraining order today\nUnder existing law by simply working through law enforcement or the immediate family of the concerning individual I think law enforcement professionals in those closest to a family member or best situated to make these especially consequential decision you're correct what that was was expanding who can seek the ... to include teachers\nCounts [noise]\n\nFamily understands long before graduation speech in a classroom ... might be you know and then can I can learn Kim ... maybe not living on it or not he made a maintenance\nMan I'm I'm\nA\nFormer marine officers studio [laughter]\nOn American or even you know the way in the army because the last woman to get here and we're making the second amendment guy and a very strong supporter of the second amendment informing\nAnd entertaining responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast theories your host farms American radio\nBars walls or\nThe right along the studio with\nYou have a ... hour one was without godly wasn't a whole bunch of information from that man he\nIs absolutely incredible again let me take this opportunity ask a half dot org and we're going to talk with a W are ...

Second Amendment and you actually get their G. R. P. C. get exposed to some groups that otherwise you may never know of groups that are fighting for Second Amendment so it's a great lady\nYou're right behind the scenes to a lot of lot of stuff we got a lot of new information information from representatives of the pink pistols for example\nAnd a couple of their local chapters in what they're doing nationally now all kinds of really fun stuff popped up at G. R. P. C. this year and of course Curt shilling was they're pushing for gun rights that was an awful lot of fun and I\nI got to sit down with Kurt ... beautiful wife Shonda at about ten o'clock on Friday after he arrived and boy I'll tell you just a personal conversation with him I don't get starstruck often but I have watched Kurt pitch for ... percent throughout his career\nAnd I it was just really cool to hear the behind the scenes story of the bloody sock for example that you know his wife ... washing it now I mean it was just I was hearing that stuff in it which is really neat though the whole conference ... like that it was an awful lot of fun [noise] alright AWOL Hawkins how about we start out\nLet's start out with a happy ending story of sorts because I Love your headline\nHas been dealing with assault charges and gunshot wounds after alleged attack on wife what happened here what is it ...\nIt was all good and not pay yeah yeah the guy on a target county North Carolina\nAnd his wife or a ... and he decided to co workers or house about two twenty this morning with a handgun that didn't work out too good for and that's how it works out well I don't think I Know the sheriff's department\nIs charged with assaulting her and assaulting a little girl who was in the hole\nAnd or after the assaults occurred or maybe during the second one of the wife shot in the you know shouting my number of times that's how it goes so you can't just bully your wife Congress like that's what the gun teacher that's why I Love the gun\nThat's a great that's a great point you can't boil your way through this life that's what the gun teaches you let me break it down a little bit because this happened today and I got to tell you I've been funny I was I fell asleep on the couch which I Want to do from time to time\nLast night and when I woke up this morning early which I Am also want to do from time to time\nI'm flipping through some TV channels I remember the clock striking to twenty\nI remember looking don't manage to twenty in the morning when we watch a couple of two and a Half Men reruns or something stupid in the middle of the night I remember it being two twenty well exactly to twenty this woman was defending her why at that exact moment in time from a ... year old who you'd think better\nBut a six year old with a handgun and you know I tried to think about it always and I think it's fair to say maybe ... her home thinking he might lead to another layer of sleep all they're hanging on you know trying to think of a different way I can but the problem is in the whole law for seeing the home\nWithout authorization and so whether he broke the gun\nFor this reason or that I don't care or the ... the wife took the right steps\nAnd that's how it works so it's another to our founders intended this horrible work you know we have a property property our property maybe big or small whatever it is when you come on to my property and you intend to harm me guess what\nYour number's up and that's how it works and that's when the second amendment is all about\nYou know what's really interesting about this too\nIs this is a husband wife deal right now this guy was no spring chicken he's sixty years old and has been around the block he's lived long enough to understand certain things he knows a lot more than David hog does now David hog might not think that but the sixty year old man just by virtue of the fact the sixty\nAnd been around long enough knows more than David hog but I digress here the point that I'm making is you would assume let me let me put it in personal 'cause I Know your wife and she's a W. R. Hawkins wife I'll assume she knows how to shoot\nMy wife is a great shot she's a she's\nKind of it's kind of embarrassing take um she's a great shot on the rank she really she has a natural shooting ability she's very good at it now I Know that about my wife so what makes me think you know from my wife who I talked to shoot a long time ago and I know how it up she's with a handgun\nThinking that she's not going to defend yourself I Know she'll defend yourself don't you think this cloud would have thought that himself\nYeah but you know how hard it is most show it better Moshe ... drives here and uh you know and the same way about Heidi Heidi with a handgun on his own believable especially when I got to throw it out with a camper micro non\nOr Gabriel micro three eighty I hate to say it if she has either one of those guns and you plan on cross you've probably make your last call let's all I'm saying but that being said this guy\nWhen I realized that they were estranged you know the emotion that goes into this I'm not making excuses for him I mean he's outta control in that way but the wife was right and not what I Love about her ears apparently like that's all I can say is apparently\nNot want a judge and who's going to guarantee those right and that's probably a ...\nYou know it's interesting watching some of the hearings and we've discussed just before I Know you're a big fan of the federalist papers as I Am there was discussion about whether or not the second amendment included\nIn the in the bill of rights because it was like brushing their teeth every ... it's just something they did they didn't feel they had to put it in the constitution it was discussed\nIn those terms and it was interesting when Kavanaugh said you went to his calendars okay but he was looking at his calendars and he said you know he said I also brush my teeth I don't put brushing my teeth\nOn my calendar or going to church because they're automatic I just do it and it was the same thing with the second amendment when it was being debated before it was ratified in December of Seventeen Ninety One so I I think there's I mean the parallels do go back\nFar when you're talking about what's happening here so I ask you the same question I asked\nI asked Alan Gottlieb the\n... you would never believe if you just parachuted in and looked at Diane Feinstein I knew nothing about her oh look at that nice old lady you would never know that the nice old lady singlehandedly\nDestroyed and she had help but she was the one that started she had the information destroyed this man's life did it intentionally because of political ideology couched that writes when I say that right\nYou did it like you to write and anybody who doesn't believe you order founder Saul rate fabulous eighty four federal aid for is their argument for why the second amendment was needed\nBecause it was a give and it was so well known that Americans would have liked to keep our guys getting rights\nCurious like people don't understand that reads federal or eighty four beyond that as you say yeah well Feinstein is a he's in first class and she has destroyed this man's life but the thing is is\nIs rarely grant the fact that politics towel and if you have politics and by that I mean if you have an office he power the public hears ... rarely grass that Democrats understand it fully\nUnderstands that Donald Trump very few other people are very few people have called on some catchy going summer catching on but very few and so that's\nThat's why it's hard even for Republicans to understand\nWhy I don't think she could be that lane what your me speculate been operating for thirty or forty ... that's right\nAnd they understand politics is power so until we wake up and understand that and are willing to play that way we'll keep all the oil at least loose a fight every now and we have to at some point understand folks a Supreme Court justice is our\nGet that through your head it's power at Trump past the gall to push this man is stand behind it you have that goal to supporting\nI Can't say it any better than you're absolutely correct his gun owners we've been watching this for Thirty years as you've said we've seen how they play pool we're getting ready to go to a break the music starts in about Fifteen seconds let me ask you this question has Lindsey Graham woke\nLindsey Graham you're still pay ...

R. Hawkins more people killed with fish feet than with rifles shotguns combined second FBI more people killed with hammers and clubs then with rifles of every kind headline\nFrom eight W. R. Hawkins at Breitbart FBI nearly four times as many people stabbed to death than killed with rifles in twenty Seventeen W. R. hocking boy that goes against everything I hear about those terrible awful salt weapons\nRight it does and and much told me about these numbers you know it's like a our second president John Adams said facts are stubborn things through Horton lie facts are stubborn things these are his fat\nAnd and when you take well nearly four times as many people stabbed to death is killed his wife will go on Cadillac all kinds of rocks every Canada right\nWell what percentage of that would be assault rifle but I don't know but guess what if\nIt's just a percentage so what if we banned assault rifle well big\nDeal if we ban assault rifles what we're going to do is they're gonna eliminate a percentage of our actual deaths yeah four times as many people will be killed the stabbing than if we look at gun do like\nThe majority of the roughly thirty thousand deaths in America from guns and that so that that's roughly twenty thousand suicide ten thousand homicides are going to be carried out with paint shows we always want to look at homicides which is a normal thing to do tend to eleven thousand homicides here\nThe past majority by bad so I don't mean twenty percent I mean Ninety eight percent ... vast majority are carried out with a young so\nYou have to ask yourself why are Democrats pursuing a ban on assault weapons it's it's the same reason that pursuing a block on Kavanaugh because it enables them to continue their agenda there's no rational reason for it I ...\nWell I think it's quite possible you could be lying because you are a white conservative\nMale\nSpy swap could be [laughter] that except that in the last two years had ... Obama John lives crime prevention Research Center shows but not last two years excuse me last four years his second term\nLimits acquired to ... minutes at a rate twice the level of men and we also know that Asians Oak Park your hair hurt me at certain times that are white higher than men so being a man and even a white man\nIt doesn't matter that didn't matter\nWomen and Asians were leaning pack during Obama's second term to all be it the less the less smoke screen is all be and what we know now if we just had you know what we don't have I must say dislike we'd only have\nTo Kurt ... to have the courage to know we have to have the courage to admitted right program with what we what we know\nWomen and minorities and we know black women in Chicago\nBlack woman and for the black woman they were all are firing permits and learning self defense was ...\nAt a rate that is unbelievable it's this is not a white man's world anymore as far as gun ownership goes this gun ownership has finally broken down ... sailing every last fall\nAnd people of all walks of life understand if I have a gun I can defend my life and one time or anyone else says something contrary or that their lives\nYou know it's interesting I just thought it just dawned on me last\nWeek at the G R PC in Chicago I interviewed three black individuals\nFor three quarters of one hour one right after the other markets welding the Santa shooter from Michigan Detroit who beat seven felonies that he was charged with simply for defending his life he was eventually acquitted and was able to show us the paperwork and held it in my hand is actual ones expungement finally\nAfter these last four years Mr Kevin Dixie spoke with me for two segments he was so good I kept and produce and of course they see on the right\nAnd I when when you see this stuff from the left this crazy politics of destruction and it everything's about race I don't know what world they're living in man I just don't know I guess it's just the bubble that they live in the you know how dare\nThese white conservative men it's just insane I saw lots of people at the G R PC that we're not quite conservative meant W.

pledged previously eighty million and now he's pledging a hundred million say raised about twenty here's the deal that Bloomberg I say he's a paper tiger expand all they want to have learned and and and if anyone doubt that Trump's election was preached\nThe people's passion outweighs money indeed day Hillary it all the ... all the money chit Hollywood shared the left New York the left on the northeast she hit everything she should have won it she looked at it on paper she should have warned but guess what\nTrump pet the people's passion and the people are passionate about the second amendment that passionate about gun rights so out of this love seeing Bloomberg wasteful more money and I mean that\nIt's true he does he wasted tournament let's keep in mind too I referred to this call them on my Daily Show last week as well and I'm Glad you put this up there because we were able to break some of this down\nIn addition to the additional twenty million that he's added in here for the total of a hundred that's not including what he's dumping in Washington that just to get a pro gun control Congress elected that's not the battles with every town for gun safety in various states the ballot initiatives and everything else this cat he's\nLet's just hope Steve twenty thirty seven doesn't get his hands on a cold time machine because he is going to come back here and not

my original like I had a ritual position which was attack three articles in which he was attacked in the Atlantic it was attacked in three pieces in the Washington Post\nAnd I am I stopped counting was this should not have ever played out it wouldn't be able to assert you'll say well of\nCourse of course if you come from past generations\nWhen they ignored women like that's my reasoning but that's my reasoning or a or\nA politically motivated because it's a Republican nominee\nSo I can only tell you\nAbout it give you my word about her but I Would have said the same thing if it had been a bit of the same moral caliber like Merrick Garland Merrick Garland ... with the majority\nSenate of Democrats Democratic president I Would have been very I'm happy to have the court go back to what slough toward\nLeftist inclinations but I never would have said\nWhat's have this is an open hearing that and there are there are so many reasons\nYou see you could say you believe her you can say that but it's not based on anything other than you believe her you have no evidence to believe her that's what's scary to me about the I Believe her\n\nYou have no reason to believe her other than that she's a female and they're saying it that's not a good reason I don't believe him because he's a mail saying\n\nI Believe in because there isn't a shred of evidence that every time she points for somebody to corroborate what happened they say I don't know what she's talking about including one of her closest friends who now says of course she says I Believe or she wants to stay or for him I don't blame her\nBut you said I I I have no recollection of such an evening okay so if for close friend who believes her because she's a close friend and I totally understand that\nShe's not going to say we'll furlough don't believe you know I don't want her to wonder why this woman to keep her friends but you believe with no evidence\nThat's very unhealthy it's not moral\nAt a certain point in society society has the right to say\nI'm Sorry you can't come now she didn't by the way that is true she didn't come the last minute she came a month before or what was the timing two months before but she said don't let anybody know about the show it's it's irrelevant what are they going to do investigate something that you are willing to talk about\nBut that was naive on her part I Want the country to know that the the man who you who many will vote on for the Supreme Court attempted to rape me in high school but I don't want anybody\nKnow about it\nI just wanted to investigate but I don't I don't want I don't want to begin to investigate if there's especially in this case there's nothing to investigate it's like the the FBI let's get the FBI or what is the FBI doesn't reach conclusions the exact same thing would have happened\nThey would have repeatedly evidence that they do have which is nonexistent it's only her word\nAnd but they would have said you know but nevertheless ah we found out\nThat the that I'm Mr judge and you know got drunk ... great the all you see it's like it's sort of like the Russian collusion investigation there is no Russian collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia\nBut we have all look Manafort so Manafort's going to jail which has nothing to do with what he did is done with collusion\nOr what is it Papadopoulos is that the guy's name the same thing\n\nSo it was it was a phony thing let the FBI investigate any way they have the right to investigate\nThey have their own funds and the Senate Judiciary committee they could all investigation as well\n[noise]\nBut when they asked the ... well then why don't you just say I'd like an FBI investigation and I don't blame him for not thinking even I didn't have an immediate answer I think this through\nThe sea simply ... he could have said nothing nothing would be resolved they don't resolve there was no evidence for that make it and we would be right back here in the exact same chamber with the exact same you believe her they believe me\nBut my friends you can't you can't favor someone because of their sex you have to favor someone because of evidence\nThere is none none zero everything she pointed to no one no one corroborate and and it is not feasible that she would remember such details but not how she got there and now how she got home\nOr that the house even exists we don't even know what House it is\nNo other whose house anything nothing ... there was literally nothing to to offer evidence for not an eye witness not a spoken to witness not a person who who drove them there\nYou're ... you're driven to a place where a fellow student tries to rape you when you don't remember how you got there then then either she was so drunk that we that\nThe recollection is invalid or it didn't happen\nNow why why now it's now it's hard for me to believe it didn't happen too because I saw her like you saw her it's hard for me to imagine she's making it all up so it did it happen and another time\nWith another person it's eminently possible since it's so difficult to to believe\nThat she would just sitting there making up a play in her mind I admit that\n\nI'm not saying she's unbelievable I'm saying there's no evidence to believe her there's a there's a big difference you can even say I believe her but but that's my instinct but we can't go on the basis of instinct in the United states of America before we ruin people's lives\nMy instinct is you did something ... totally contrary to the type of human being that you are that was my original point\nDoes it matter\nDoes a lifetime of integrity matter the answer on the left is no that's a very very big statement\nYou are who you were in high school no matter how good you are now or have been since high school that is why they're they are largely\nNon Bible based Bible based people understand repentance\nPeople on the left to know you did something awful\nYou remain awful you are tainted forever\nWell\nThen really I think that from now on the ... any appointee should immediately have his or her high school years resurrected by investigators ... let me ask you a question\nAnd by the way you go to pray for Hillsdale says another thing we hear you on the Prager show thank you for your support All right but it's part of my belief that we have to help each other we help pills Dale Hillsdale helps us and you and the country [noise] Prager for Hillsdale\nDot com peas and ammonia or is it ruined his amazing his thing which is ... ... and got out he isn't emphysema or\nAs in the room it to them for Hillsdale dot com\n[noise] people\nDon't like to see the upshot support they believe so high school is a male but\nTell me and I I'm asking you win this car ways possible do you not see that from now all we have to investigate how a person acted in high school and why why draw the line there\n\nOkay Carol in Cleveland hello Carol Dennis Prager from Dana but normally on a speaker phone got to talking to the phone please\nI'm Sorry I just hear her when I can I'm proud of that and and being a woman I'm having a lot of women friends I'm the comments that have been happening all along that well I Want to laugh at night and less it and I was the last I was harassed so\nYou know everybody including me too and liars you then you know I Would say I'm the owner of the art business I worked for the only sixteen years old and they try to protect me\nOn the back door I work yet and though it wasn't a fun experience I don't want everything in the that way\nAnd I think what we come home now and what I think that's where younger one of them don't understand and they're creating Annette ... victims that are happening now\nIs that it's wind has been crossed and as you said that we have to investigate everybody background and anybody can be a kid at any point ... any time without any kind of evidence\nAnd I happened to you mark ... a lot on what people don't really see that as a baby step across the line and it will continue\nTo Iraq that is correct thank you so ... says serious in silver state when does want to make that is exactly right by the way there were some good fallout from this the national review editor\nThey're rich Lowery sort of I Know I I I have great much more sympathy for Trump supporters though\nA lot of my fellow writers bashing review above the amount of agreed with me being overly respect for was to make that clear\nSplits beside the point but they they have been very reluctant to ... to be on the Trump bandwagon as they would put it but now as Larry ... he said\nI think I understand Republicans have understood you can put up a choir boy we did Mitt Romney and they the famed him as much as they could to\nIn high school by the way from high school to remember believe they're gay kid right with the high school yeah and John McCain he said John McCain who mailed they loved it when he was running they called him a racist\n\nSaid I understand I I get it I get it it doesn't matter who Republicans put up they will smear you no matter what\n\nWas that that are very few people in public life for coal life with
