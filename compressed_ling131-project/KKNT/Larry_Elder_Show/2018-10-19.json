also a year in your pocket\nYou get six thousand dollars a year extra I'm from uh California senator planned six thousand dollars\nWell let me say first off I Am always in favor of lowering tax one of about tell you about is not lowering taxes I'm always in favor giving back\nThe hard working Americans more of their money and this is not about giving back the money to hard working Americans Mrs about Democrats who were desperate\nFigure out a way to get people to vote for that\nAnd they see their books and to government aid by the people that they represent deteriorating in a very rapid pace\nWhen you have unemployment numbers that are all time low for African Americans that is the worst news for for for any democratic candidate they need people to not be able to make it on their own to stay alive\nThe Democrats business model is half people dependent on us so they cannot survive without us\nTherefore they vote for us it's a very simple business structure of the Democratic party if you're a Democrat it is bad for business to have\nPeople that are succeeding\n\nIf you're a Democrat it's bad for business if someone is trying to make their own money it's bad for your business and the Democrat if that person feels like they can actually take care of themselves their families and are moving forward you wonder why Democrats don't fix failing schools I said this before on the show\nThey crashed don't fix failing schools because without failing schools\nHave voters Democrats are highly intelligent people traditionally if people were killed by the public school system who\nHave skills that they can make it on their own without the government hoping that\n\nI Would say the Democrats purposely set up a public school education system not even to undocumented anymore it's just about making sure they're dumb enough to Egypt\n\nIs the Democratic party fixing schools in the inner city if they fix the schools and high crime areas of high poverty or is the schools with minorities were they were getting an education preparing them for a life after high school whether that's true okay seal training and going straight in the workforce are going to college they lose out on too many voters\nThey cannot survive without highly intelligent voting bloc in this country\nSo they have done everything they possibly can to make sure that they are consistently graduating people cannot succeed on the wrong\nAnswer Donald Trump Donald Trump said I'm going to get jobs back in this country and he's done it and to get better trade deals she's done it I'm going to get rid of regulations are destroying American job\nHe's done it I'm going to give incentives for companies to work in America and not keep their money offshore and build factories that Americans are building them overseas and I'm going to fight back on tariffs which is God I'm going to get back to the American people their own money which is down with the ... when the Trump tax cuts\nAre going to have a country that has aggressively growing\n\nIt was better for everybody where the water is shipped\nHardcore leftist Democrat who has I Would argue virtually no show and the reason why I say that is based on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts\nWhere she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because of in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out\nWith an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\n\nShe was an American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for eight months the tax credit a five hundred dollars that six thousand a year\nOn her new legislation they announced today by the Democratic party this democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California she just said individuals making less than Fifteen thousand dollars a year\nShe'll be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\n\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages I mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is why\nAmericans are working harder than ever before right now because the jobs are good and the and the economy's good and what many people want from Kevin climate to fill time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything is nothing about why and checking every Republican Donald Trump sad fact checking her on that because statement in our own or is it why\nI'm not going to focus on that for for like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you\nThis office she wrote about this plan today they treat the seven teams survey\nFrom the bank right now I'm more than half of Americans cannot afford eight five hundred dollar unexpected extent such as you increase a medical bill for child care\n\nNow survey came out there had a lot of his own survey we found the article says just getting Americans have savings savings they rely on in an emergency\n\nThat you\nAre saying okay a bomber phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to look for me because people can actually play for them on phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps and we're seeing record numbers do fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in the great economy and they're providing for themselves\nGovernment aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I got to do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank rate dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford to pay five hundred dollar unexpected effects pets\nLet me just explain to you how worked this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first Barbara proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year and the reason why she wants to give me that money every month is because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with a rent increase of medical bill or childcare so she wants to give you a government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand dollars a year\nHave an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your expected expects\nNow my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody who's making nine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make sure I said it's number correctly 'cause I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the level of freak out and said I said it wrong so I'll correct it right now calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand\nNine or nine dollars a year\nAnd you can't say for five hundred dollar unexpected expense hearing idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money is going to take your government money and then go\nAll thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to save that money because at the same dumb a hasn't say five hundred dollars up is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nMinimum when we had the tax code that came out Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they would they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people

princess had no problem with the prince kissing or that's the whole point of the whole dead gum stupid story and the first place\nWe now need do because we're social justice warriors in here me as a feminist activists actress\nYou need a war in your head about prince kissing a princess without her previous consent and we're going to stop this living from terrorizing the nation that was made in Nineteen thirty seven the animated by golly\n[noise]\nHow are you supposed to deal with this with your kids or your grandkids well speaking about it she says she raises new stories to her own children and she gets offended and then she correct that every time we close you know why I look at my girls and ask do you think that it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old way it's wise to eat the apple\nCart when she got the apple from\n\nPresident Bill added that she tells her kids not to take food from strangers are so why doesn't the story okay well I'll let that wouldn't go okay fine hey this is a story it's not real life you're not a print says he's not a prince\nLet's just ruin everything for kids whatsoever with imagination let's let's just immediately when they come out of the room start indoctrinate them to be paranoid of every person everything and everything should have a consent involved including the damn apple\n\nMisspell also slammed Snow White this movie from Nineteen thirty seven\nFor the scene where the prince kisses the sleeping princes without asking permission and this is me two and two thousand Eighteen folks if you don't think they're trying to ... I mean\nThe ... the fact that we went from ... arguments I Would ... cases where I I used to protect and defend an advocate for the me too movement Bill Cosby Hollywood\nProducer what was that guy's

me at scenes from Nineteen thirty seven that are animated or the prince kids in the sleeping princess without asking permission\n\nNow if you want to be really annoying\nI'll go there\nLet's talk about Kristin Bell's movies\nTalk about what she's been good I I Am the and I am deeply and that was called something like that yeah\n[noise]\nWell it's just talk about what she's been in\n\nForgetting Sarah Marshall there was some consent issues there ... there was some consent issues there there's a lot of making out and stuff they went on those\n\nYou're going to critique you're on movies\n\nFamily Guy you're the voice of Martha you want to critique Family Guy\nI was talking about a bad moms Christmas I think there was some women in there the kids to other women without consent asking permission I'm pretty sure in a bad moms Christmas there were some moms who sexual ... men and slapped them on the edge double ass\n\nIn bad mom's the original movie watched the movie and look at how many different things happening in that movie without consent\nIncluding what you could argue with sexual harassment I wanted to do which by the way had no problem with it because he was getting the attention of some hot\nMoms but consent matters by golly\nAnd if we're going to go all the way back\n\nTo Nineteen thirty seven and make a big deal out of Snow White then we share a better apply that to your own movie reel Mrs bell\n\nShe was also one she in a TV series and I'm quoting when it called played against Dick\n\nI'll let you guys do that research\n\nShe was in parks and she was in parks and recreation after she was in play it again Dick\n\nShe was also in a movie where the lifeguards I think there were some sex seven their superheroes speed dating she was in that she was this fake super girl and movie forty three go see if there's any issues in that movie with lack of consent before someone kisses somebody\nKnow gossip girls a TV series for most Seventy thousand trucks have anybody to kiss anybody in the gossip girls without their consent asking may I kiss you before I kiss you because you can't even read things now\n\nWhat else so she and besides how she was in scream for has clearly I was there any consent issues in that movie before someone gets somebody grab something party down she was in that one\n\nWent in Rome I Wonder if there was an consent issues there assassins creed I think she was on how to get a video game once just throwing that out there couples retreat I Know there was some sexual stuff in capitals retreat without consent\nSo you got to let your kids watch your own movies forgetting Sarah Marshall I'm pretty sure there was some consent issues were holding hands kissing or grabbing of sexual parts of the body then you're going to you're going to critique that\n\nI'm not defending Disney I'm defending sanity on this one\n\nIf you're going to go out there and you're going to attack Disney and you're going to say that Disney is putting your kid's life in danger\n\nAnd your daughters need to know that that prince says some sort of I mean you're in you're you're telling your kids at extremely young age\n\nThat man is a predator\n\nThey kiss a princess that's what you're doing that is what you're saying\n\n\n[laughter] lord have mercy Mrs ... this is liberalism we now are going to attack Disney

princes are the only way you're going to get out of college kids which we all know is also not reality\n\nHeadline usa Chris melting Snow White tells kids the wrong message about strangers and consent\nCurse him elder boys princes and flows into parrots she loves hurting their daughters and who are three and five when they're cut up like Mir cats but bell says she's not a hundred percent counter or the classic Disney Princess tales\n\n\nI Would never take food women strangers or first issue of the whole apple thing All right I'll give you that when she also asked her daughters about the Snow White book when talking about consent when it comes to at best prince charming presumptuous behavior\nDon't you think she says there are kids that it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White
