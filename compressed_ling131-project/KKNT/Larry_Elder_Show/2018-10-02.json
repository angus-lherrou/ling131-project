about what they're doing standing in line\nThey are extreme that supposedly so much so that even the New York times wouldn't print that accusation but all of it is fair game any accurate position\nIs

know they can't get a lower than this they break new ground [noise]\nTell me that's my first question to you\nHow you were able to contain yourself I Won a prayer seven seven six these people's disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them in fact what I did was I was teaching part time and so every time a Democrat got on I knew I had to listen but I kind of work this out the little bit [noise]\nI I it's hard to take it's really hard to take Kavanaugh was not even my first choice by the way to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nIf the pope was Trump's nominee and he has left us make no mistake about it they wouldn't have been against him it doesn't matter if Trump appointed him by the way why didn't have to they need hearings or future FBI investigations when they know how they're going to vote they already know answer\nTo suffering people like Jeff Flake\nTalk about being name correctly [laughter] you know as soon as I heard his name I have some doubts he said if you remember he would vote for Kavanaugh and hysterical woman can funds him and he admits that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation can you believe that Jeff Flake is a fool\nVista lake will not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats\nIt will further divide us this is all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham hadn't just right\nThis is all about power and I I and all of us probably can take it more easily if they just said what they felt\nBut they're a bunch of phony hypocrite left us who disgust me tell me what you think of wanting prayers seven seven six but it's worse than that because we now have taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anybody with any crime you want\nAnd you don't even need to have corroborating evidence it doesn't matter if they are innocent you can still ruin their lives\nAnd there are no consequences for the accusers because it's very difficult you have to prove that they did it with mouse do you remember Ronald Reagan's secretary of labor I think his name was a secretary Donovan\nWhen asked after he was found innocent of some charters I don't remember the charges anymore after he was found innocent they said something about where we go next to what are you going to do now and he said something like where do I go to get my reputation back exactly where pray tell me\nDoes judge Kavanaugh will go to get his reputation back\nIt's gone now at least for a lot of people the Democrats and the left have ruined his reputation and some like Feinstein have the nerve to question his belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do Senator Feinstein after you helped destroy his life\nAct ever so serene as you ruined his life and his life of his family and his dentist has pointed out we're is his bank account for all the good work he's done for all these years\nHow did Bill Clinton by the way stay is president after what he did with the complicity view Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate\nThis was not a good week for American I Want to know what you think that one a prayer seven seven six and I can see the borders are already filled but you know I I go to calls pretty fast\nNow we're going to get close to break but as for Christine Ford do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard of all I read some by Dr Thomas old saying you don't confuse the motion with the facts so yeah she was emotional and believable but are you know hard maybe getting underway\nYou guys all have great calls are mostly yeah let's go to a sure in Minnesota sure you're on with mark\nMark Hi how are you well good I'm\nOut of a couple of things um that last caller was talking about her um her and her behavior [noise]\nUm I look at like two different types she would how confused when they actor and writer Arnold looked like she never heard of that because I don't do in New Hampshire\nAnd then she had those ... I don't know if anyone else but I was glad looked like they are either that or she never clean them and almost scary this little cat continues kind of look\nAbout a ... actually I Know one hand yeah I I\nI actually heard that you had including the glasses for thirty five years [laughter]\nGet on the\nHand she got two master's and I'm sure it and she teaches in two different colleges\nWait wait wait wait wait wait wait I Do oh you're telling me you respect the H. D. degrees master's degree you know I'm just\nSaying I'm just saying there is a huge debt that desperate maybe that's not the right one now but yeah I I I you know huge difference\nAnd the thing that I I wanted to mention is and I've not heard anyone say there um when they asked her about her friend Leland and she would cut from there\nUm she she talked about the president was she got some help on how to respect your health issue I'm thinking about this former fourteen year old girl even before cellphones and next we'll end what I call her and said you know\nWhat happened you know she I remembering eight mile come home\nWell I should get home and you know I didn't\nShe didn't she tell she was leading or at least give her a car and you know what happened after Iraq or any of that was kind of things that get it all by holding her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on it\nYet what are you disappointed in the prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you take like I did this ... reach a climax in\nMy head and I think yeah I mean you know when it came to the new drink and then she got my heart thing because I thought boy oh boy this is how they're going\nWe all were done for and I was\nSo proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in ... and and anybody that you know make fun of him crying Corker bringing up daughter I guess we're ... ... what would you not do it anywhere accused of something so horrific\nWell yeah and but you can't go negative well of course and you can't win because if you've been Tom they would have said well he was accused of all these sort of you to death but not find something and the other say lives to belligerent to be a justice I got if she can't win with him that that's the point you did it well I think she critical shirts\nYou you can't win with them how could you win was um it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what the truth is can't win with\nThese people's but people people thank you mark six that let's see some other great call let's go to um boy we're going to get that break Amy uh this is just this could be brief in Columbus ohio you run with mark\n... heart Hi Emmy knee high I just wanted to make the point really crack 'em I just thought the other day I'm not sure whether or not but one thing I think if I was in ...
