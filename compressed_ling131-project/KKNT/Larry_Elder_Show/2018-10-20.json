Salvadorans Guatemalans Hondurans all waving their flags demanding to march across Mexico and enter our country and our elected officials seemed completely feckless than and able to do anything about it\nBut you know if there's one thing that they're supposed to do is protect our nation protect our sovereignty protect our borders and they have no interest in doing so [noise] uh and that\nIs very much about this midterm election they should certainly be for front of your mind or we're going to talk about that coming up in a bitter white now want to talk to women specifically women [noise]\nAh because I see when I saw the Brett Kavanaugh story turned the way that it did when I talk to women\nAnd they told me that they were so angry at what was done to now justice Kevin when they told me that when they saw justice Kavanaugh when they bend judge Kavanaugh talking and having to defend himself they saw their husband they saw their father they saw their son who had lived the life that they would want them to live\nAchieve something at the highest level of something to be a dedicated his entire professional life too and then they saw Democrats defending him they saw Democrats are ... due process trying to destroy this man for their own selfish political purposes and then wrapping their attacks\nIn this this protective blanket of of women's rights of of trying to protect\nThe victims of sexual assault ... weaponized sing the me too movement you know the ... this whole me to say and I'm not a huge fan of the hashtags and the slogans and the movement and that step I don't think you are to we like to be free\nWe conservatives we don't like to follow the herd we don't like to follow a a a trend we don't like to be a part of a movement and must that movement is about individual liberty and freedom which ultimately is anti movement right\nThat the dichotomy of being a conservative and someone who wants to freedom is that uh you you you joined a movement\nTo push for independence and the whole idea of independence is that you don't have to be part of a movement [laughter] so am I but but that said\nI have great respect for women who do step forward and accuse horrible people doing horrible things and the me too movement inspired by the Harvey Weinstein situation was so completely and totally different than what we saw with Kevin ... are these were women\nWho were not acting politically\nWho we are not attacking a person for his politics probably agree with him on his politics in fact his politics is what probably protected Harvey Weinstein\nIn many ways because he gave to all the right causes and and donated all the right of feminist politicians so he could you could wear the mantle of feminists are Harvey wouldn't do that he loves women after all he donates to Planned Parenthood which is\nThe most despicable statement one could ever make if you really love and care about women the last thing you would do is give money to Planned Parenthood but that's how the left thinks that's how Hollywood sex\nAnd the me too movement as it came forward under heavy one soon and some of the other allegations of Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and they're all Democrats have you noticed there all liberals\nThey're all they're all in the media for that matter\nBut what they had in common that we didn't see it in the Kavanaugh proceedings was that there was immediately a floodgates opened of other valid corroborated\nCompletely credible allegations what we saw with Kavanaugh were a couple of other allegations you know led by the likes of Michael ...\nThey were completely and incredible ... locked any ... any consistency\nBut what you saw with the cab nothing was the politicization of the me too movement you saw me to use as a political weapon to destroy somebody because ultimately they didn't like their politics\nIt was just the last quiver in their ... wait the left arrow in their quiver you know what I mean\nIt was the last weapon at their disposal they tried everything else God Knows during those confirmation hearings and this one they secretly surreptitiously held back and then threw it out there as their final attack that's\nAll it was and it was despicable and it was dishonorable and it went against everything that we in America stand for innocent until proven guilty due process and when I talked to women they were outraged at the Democrats about that\nAnd then something happened first of all Democrats aren't talking about it anymore which tells me you know they get it and they think that this was a loser for them if they spend too much time money focusing on it\nBut then I had I mentioned that I'm from Michigan My brother and one of my brother's still live up to my brother's children Michigan one of them lives in the Detroit area listening a W J are my brother duck and I just spent a weekend with him and and he told me\nI've heard this from some other people in other areas where there are

C. W. M. A. L. is uh in the nation's capital it's the talk radio station of record in your capital\nAnd I do the uh the show right before mark ripe for three hours after new Dr Larry OConnor I sit in for him then goes mark within so on my way home I listen to my ... here's the thing I Can't listen to anyone else\nI I'm too afraid that I that they might plans an idea that I Will inadvertently take or or you know purposely take a bath and and also it's funny when you get into the business it's harder to listen to talk radio\nBecause you know you sort of know what goes on as I got filmmakers looking movies they don't look at movies the same way you when I look at movies because they're looking at how it's been put together sort of that way for me with talk radio now but the with mark\nFirst of all he's incredible I Love the show it's very different than my usual show actually um am to end in ... frankly because he's on immediately after my show\nI you know I I'm ... ... these days the news cycle mysteries what's important what's happening now\nBut he changes five times before I'm On the air again Twenty one hours later so I can listen to mark and I love listening to mark a and and I have no fear of you know but it did take in any of his his ideas are the lines are is takes because by the time I'm On the air it's all new it's all different\nYou may disagree but guess what he has the right to do that that doesn't make them a spy it doesn't make him a Russian agent now he could be some misunderstand my point here [noise]\nCarter Page could very well be an agent of the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on\nThe Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate the story that is presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and blood and reporting to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenty sixteen presidential election as they say that\n[noise] understand to facts number one to this day\nHas charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey\nNot Loretta Lynch\nNot Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein no one at the federal level now one of the local level when at the state level Carter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page\nAnd you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit new trees in the facts\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and let him repeating scrambling to alter\nOur presidential election and twenty sixteen if if that were true why would you file a lawsuit why would you file a defamation lawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect is that the DNC can defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy it's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is proof\nThat Carter Page\nIs in fact an agent of the Russian government and if your quarter page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a federal court well funded and you know there's going to be a lotta money funding their defense all well funded investigation into you\nIf you truly are\nAn agent of the Russian government\nWhy would you do that\nWould you do that\nAnd I again I I he could be an agent of the Russian government Carter Page and James Comey and Peter shark and Andrew McCabe and Loretta Lynch and and the whole team over there during the Obama administration\nWho ordered this investigation this unprecedented spying on an American citizen who was connected with the presidential campaign during a presidential election and then only so much of it got leaked to the press shocking how much of it got leaked to the press they could be true\nIn there with the angels right now and how pure they acted in behaved and they they were just defending our nation against the foreign attack how former of foreign cyber attack from Russia with their with their agent ... that that could all be trip\nBut I'm using my brain I'm thinking it through logically and I'm thinking if it were true I'm thinking the last thing that I Do if I were Carter Page is what he did this week\nRight that one less thing\nIf it were true think about it for a minute the last person who wants this to be discovered if not even Carter Page it's vitamin ...\nSo they so since you're still using that brain I Want you to think about something what has happened to people historically who had gone against the wishes of Vladimir Putin's\n... if you think if if he is a spy for ... and you think once it's out there\nSo either Carter Page as a spy and he's going to end up with a bomb in his head or he could very well be assisting in exposing the\nBiggest political scandal in American history\nJust food for thought I'm wary of counter it's the mark within ... a month\n\nHave you ever thought about the word education well it means to lead for the [noise]\nThe word fourth raises

Lewis equal\nWe're talking about the new movie Halloween we'll give you some background on it\nAnd tell you whether it really is worth seeing coming up on the Mad Men show will also talked about a new TV series that has gotten a number of people very upset\nIt's about God working through social media well why wouldn't God works through social media and\nTwo thousand Eighteenth I mean it's kind of the fish in a way of\nCommunicating and if the president United States does it through Twitter every day uh we'll be talking a little bit about the new TV series got friended me are coming up with one of the producers we will also be speaking about I'm a potential presidential match up\nThat a lot of people are excited about would be a Nikki Haley on the Republican side versus Beto O'Rourke on the Democratic side more Beto O'Rourke I mean the the media love affair with this guy is something to behold\nDoes he deserve all of the hype and then we're going to be speaking to Stephen Moore the author ... new book called Trump's ... about some of the lives about the economy and what happens next after the November\nElections to help Trump fulfill his America First vision of economic reform one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number but first up\nLast night the president gave a a a rally speech and he was an extraordinarily good spirits he seemed extremely jolly\nThe one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it and you know they've CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it\nAnd let me just acknowledge\nI think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president said that it was a praise worthy or a vet that basically congressman Gianforte Greg Gianforte of Montana he was in ... in Missoula\nAnd Congressman John forte and at the time I thought that John forte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed the reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter read assaulted and I've spoken to Congressman John forte this was one of the most embarrassing moments with his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a a good idea for President Trump to make light of it I don't think ours when John forte would think that however\nWhat struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually what Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way was laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican trying to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate race has become unexpectedly close\nBetween our candidate Rosendale and the incumbent Democrat Jon Tester who pretends because he wants lost a finger in a farming accident\nNo there's no solidarity there was to show me what I told him that he because he was lost a finger in a farming accident he's really a moderate Democrat he's a a good old boy and said he's not he's a big liberal\nAnd a Trump was speaking on behalf of Matt Rosendale another Montana Republican and he had this to say and defining what this election should be about\n[noise] [noise] oh Kavanaugh\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nIt's gotta be election of say\nOkay he's talking about the cabin on the caravan and common sense and I think he threw in off off script the idea of law and order but that that do fine I'll look in terms of Kavanaugh\nObviously because of the treatment of a justice Kavanaugh that has mobilized lots of Republicans and there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do polling and the betting and things like that say there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six so right now Republican prospects there surging even in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because yes with their response to justice Kavanaugh the Democrats show that they're not the party\nOf jobs they're the party of well we'll let the president delivers on line\nBut the choice to not be more clear Democrats ...\nRepublicans for new jobs [noise]\n\nShe [noise]\nTry and shot [noise] and the Democrats they want to raise your taxes they want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they get Venezuela 'cause that's what's going to have [noise] they want to take away your health care because you won't be able to have in our country will be able to afford it\nDestroys your Second Amendment and when you're doing drugs and vicious gangs because plenty of them are coming across a lot of drugs\nOkay and this is a problem for President Trump\nBecause guess what he's president United States Republicans control the Senate in the house they roll apartment homeland security they control lights\nAnd he is right that there are a lot of people coming across the border I just looked at the numbers and they're sad\nOr the number of people entering the country illegally is not going down and went down the first year of Trump's presidency or the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency [noise]\nSound like tripled where it was when Trump became president of the rates in September were staggering\nAnd that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan and by the way the evidence appears to be as of a half hour ago\nThat there was some progress getting Mexican authorities to move troops to try to block the advance of of what looks to me over four thousand people waiting Honduran flags by the way\nWe're marching their way through Guatemala and then through Mexico and they say they're headed to the United states what do Democrats say we know where Trump's stance\nTrump stands on a common sense principle which I honestly who who could disagree you cannot let this caravan in you can feel sorry for these people\nBut if we go ahead and say oh well you march told his way well coming up we'll process your your applications for asylum but then they will be no end to it\nIt will encourage more and more and more and more and look it's it's a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible maybe even more compassionate\nBut right now the question with this caravan is whether we have an immigration system at all\nOr whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction\nAnd uh I think frankly President Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as he is going to win victory in turn the caravan back where there's going to be some kind of awful disaster and\nI think the incoming president of Mexico Andres Lopez Manuel Obrador\nUm has a ... actually\nShown some willingness to work with the Trump Administration on something\nThis caravan which is crucial I've been a Trump ... said this about\nThe economy and related it of course to the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nBecause such an incredible autonomy money [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay [noise]\nUh probably the rhetoric I've created so much I have done this either and no and that's not ideal rhetoric but look the fact is the economy has done better that's what we're going to be talking about with Stephen Moore coming up and and just a moment\nThe point over here and I think it's very striking is everybody knows what Trump's as everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about that has anyone heard a any kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\nBecause I've heard nothing all they do is they attacked Trump and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night\nBeto O'Rourke the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two thousand Eighteen but for two thousand and twenty and beyond beta or who's a talented politician but he blew up\nHis his own campaign and frankly I think his own future with a one answer that was just calling we'll get to that and that to your calls coming up we'll also be speaking with Stephen Moore\nYou know I'm actually watching on the on the screen I'm watching CNN as we talk a and I'm I'm watching all these people you know I Know there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on and\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line is that\nYeah revenues are actually up this year so we passed the biggest tax cuts in three years and we actually have a slight increase Rutgers not look I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenue to put people in a work at ... businesses profitable businesses back from United States which has happening uh but yeah look the problem is spending and you know people say oh you're just a rival Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats were for bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast amount every department five percent yes\nI Love that and you know that's what businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business and you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and that's what businesses did during the recession they talked in their stomach\nThey tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable gap we never do that and government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and apartments and that is a structure and what we need pipelines we need a lot of Alan gee terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our porch\nA lot of that Michael I think can be could be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nAnd I think that's a great ... points for President Trump to borrow from other book Trump ... from my friend and guess Stephen Moore he is a a chief economist at the Heritage Foundation of the book is posted up at our website\nAnd Michael ... dot com or when we come back I Want to talk a little bit about the ah ... blow up and it is a blow up at major major major stumble by the golden boy of the Democratic left why we'll get to that coming up with amendments
