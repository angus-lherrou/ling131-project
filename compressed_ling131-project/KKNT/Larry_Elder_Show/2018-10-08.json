she specializes in personal wealth transfer and tax planning\nRe before the break I was asking you whether or not you would think that the JFK family I Would would hold up under the kind of scrutiny that the Trump family just underwent by these reporters at the New York times\nWell you know what not that familiar with the with the Kennedy family except that I Do know that they have a labyrinth of cross um in which\nFamily wealth is spread over I think it's fourteen or Fifteen family now but the\nMost important thing is those trusts were created because much of the tax laws the credit Mary trust to marry a Trump were\nSubject to a were passed so for example the Kennedys died before the\nUh Nineteen eighty six a\nGeneration skipping tax was introduced so they could pass wealth down to their grandchildren without a an extra level of the state tax at every generation but I'm sure that they had some dental Joe Kennedy was not exactly the cleanest a a living person alive and I'm sure that there are\nThere were problems or ways but he skirted the tax laws um I just don't know\nNow the article the New York times ... says that ah the statute of limitations has run on many of these transactions but there is no statute of limitations for science for civil fraud or is that is the president or in in jeopardy\nWell I mean the IRS has been scrutinizing the Trump family for many decades I I just I just can't imagine that suddenly they're going to say oh look what we found\nAnd now they're civil penalties there is one thing that you should know though and that's if if something if some gift was made and no gift tax return was filed to report it in any way there's no statute of limitations on the assessment of tax on bat gift [noise]\nAre you uh went to war and you got a degree in economics ... were you there around the same time you know who was there\n[noise] um no he uh I I started at the Wharton School and he in both he and I were actually at the undergraduate school but he I Believe I graduated in Nineteen sixty seven sixty eight and I didn't start there until the fall of sixty nine so we did we were not contemporaries ...\nWhen you read the New York times article did anything occur to you they gave you an idea of what to do or what not to do it did anything pop up when you said wow I never thought of that court boy that's a bad idea\nNo I mean the the article does talk about the most important part of their\nA movement of wealth downstream wants to do things to devalue the gifts because our gift in a state taxes are what we used to call in Latin class at the lower them they're based upon them value at the date of death or in the case would get that on a date of the gift\nAnd so there are techniques which are used to diminish the value of the of the gifts so for example if I were to give you a twenty percent uh ownership of my house just to be for me to Larry Elder over twenty percent interest\nBut instead I buy that that's one value twenty percent of whatever the value is because in California we have the ability to pursue to sell the property if you worry partial owner fractional interest on the other hand if I put it into a partnership or limited liability company the whole property\nAnd in that been here a organizing documented says nobody can partition this and read is the only person who can make decisions about the property\nThen you have in your twenty percent you cannot sell it\nAnd you cannot a manager so I have\nThe management control and I have the ownership control and\nThat diminishes your twenty percent so if you went out and tried to sell your twenty percent interest in our partnership it would be far less than twenty percent of the underlying real property\nSo I've just diminished the value that has been accepted by the IRS on the courts and the only thing that the IRS argues with practitioners like me is what is the discount that is allowed\nVery commonly it's twenty or thirty percent that's a kind of a safe harbor these days where\nWe have just one minute left of the Washington Post I'm Karen ... ah she's a reporter with them described the New York times report as depicting a quote criminal enterprise ... would you call what you read a criminal enterprise\nWell and if you want to call virtually every ... every closely held building us a criminal enterprise or that they are uh you know it's it's very common that a a an older business owner or takes no salary in order for more of the profits to go to his employee children\nJust are so many ways that people

went down to the seaside beach area you know just a little bit east of dust in West to Panama City the route thirty a area of the Florida Panhandle gorgeous beaches down there and what I had a house rented for about four days\nWhen I got down there I found out that there was some construction work going on in the house I said no no no not going to happen in the house I paid for not going to happen right\nSo a rather than make us think out of the deal you know what I decided to do I decided to play nice with everybody\nWith the with the real estate agent with the with the the the ... the managing company which I Believe was Wyndham I played nice with them and you know and and I had an opportunity\nTo me it just restore my space really in in these tough incredibly difficult trying political times in America today sometimes we we tend to look at things through that prism we don't know who we are talking to and sometimes we attack\nWe go on the attack because we're so edgy we just don't know when this this this world we live in today puts us in that terrible mood\nAnd you know I met some great people in one of them was a guy named Vance garrison who was the roof or doing the work at the house I had a conversation with him I said look we're on vacation he says no we don't want to mess with your vacation when are you leaving\nI sit on Wednesday he says will see on Wednesday do enjoy your time off and it was everything just worked out perfect amazing we're being nice can do you get it back is what I'm telling you you get it back and he's with\nRoyal roofing and restoration those guys were unbelievable\nAnd they're listening on W. while well right now one oh one FM news talk in the Panama City area was fun I got to listen to my own show\nBearing down there

love you guys you guys did a great job they give you restore people like you would just be store faith in humanity so nice to meet good people and their fans of the show what does that tell your right\nOkay so that's some fun stuff let me give you the guess wind up we're going to jump right into it\nAlan Gottlieb is going to join you know I have so much to go over with and we're going to keep him for a couple of segments I've got a surprise call coming in\nFrom Rob Pincus about a video you got to see I got to squeeze in men in the final segment so let's go right smack the Alan Gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation Alan how the heck are you lose faith in humanity out there isn't there and there are great people out there when you find the right\n[noise] yeah they're all gonna owners\nThey often do you know what I can attest to that I Know of ads and the rest of those guys are where we had some just fantastic conversation and you're right they absolutely are\nBoy but it was it was a it was kind of an eye opening thing you go in and you think bad attitude and then what do you do you draw bad things going with a great attitude and great things happen so just wanted to just kind of wanted to throw that let's start with this this is the gorilla elephant whatever you want to call it in the room cabin off like you've got to tell me how you feel this bruising thing\n[noise] well I feel really great I think that any community should be on cloud nine uh this is a very important battle to conserve lights\nOn it specially static because we have to search conditions from the second ... cutting us cream colored could this term and of course a cabinet wasn't that it would give us a lot of problems in in getting as a secretary has either hurt\nOr you know are getting a confirmation 'cause it's Supreme Court to correct the lawsuits\nSo I'm kind of excited on going to be on pins and needles the session\nOf the two important cases one man's coming out of the ... circuit what were you one of the trial court level and then lost by one vote ... panel in the ... circuit best suited knocked out for a while at least the interstate ban on sales handguns Ninety to ...\nYou know since when you're in the same lab a it's a background check all across the country there's no reason why you couldn't buy it shouldn't be able to buy and get anywhere it's the same background check and then our second suit his tenure at California in the Ninth Circuit\nWere overturned a you know again I'm In Bonn panel in the Ninth Circuit a and that's the one that deals with California so called Hank roster that strongly diminishing our handguns are a lot for sale in California every year\nA and virtually no new hangers get edited a list of old fall off or to there's less less choice for buying hanging in the state of California and also deals with the so called micro standard requirement or where any new new handgun ... reality show micro standing out on it when you know if I had a cartridge\nUm and and the technology it's unproven and all we had the single provider to it\nAh and it's a real problem so I'm kind of excited about both those cases and and now I have a lot of the culture this coming year\nOh my gosh you know our and I have to listen to your [noise] those are pages of notes of things that I Want to talk with you about and you kind of it's so easy for you to just make it easy for me to crumble is up from way okay let's go down some of the rabbit holes that you just opened up their let's talk briefly about the two cases now that Kavanaugh is on the court\nWhat I heard and I'm speaking on behalf of my listeners just make sure that they understand what I heard I Want to\nGet that get that information to them what I understand now is that with these two petitions now waiting that the court is getting ready to look at these in upcoming conferences or you're getting ready to file these where are we\nThere filed a we're waiting for the ... or even the conference assignments right now or some kind of random ... you know there should be hopefully they will take the case is an optical have argued that so we're going to wear on pins and needles right now [noise] All right\nSo let me play a little bit of devil's advocate we know what happened with Gorsuch and with Thomas at the ... when they when the court did not grant search to that what I thought was a very very important case out there in California I really wish I knew all of us and the gun rights community had thought and hope and pray that they were going to take they did not\nAnd of course Gorsuch and Thomas panda skating I\nGuess descent as to why they should have a you know blaming the fact that the courts have been afraid of the second amendment as of late treating it as a second class right having said that\nWere responsible gun owners turned out a lot of independents Democrats that but they voted in such a minute first uh and that could Trump across the finish line in the state to like ... or so they they're ... they want to get even with us more than anything because it's been upset their whole agenda\nIt's interesting when you were talking about the anti gun groups the ...\nSpecial gun prohibition is very well funded from Michael Bloomberg and I want to go to Michael Bloomberg and the next segment with you as well or some state in the recently made\nThat if you or I may we will be called racist for well what you hear him and just a minute but having said that\nIt it was very noticeable to me that while yes I saw some visible anti gun propaganda out there it seemed to me that the mainstream media focused more\nOn the whole wacko lunatic you know pink cat wearing crazy we're all gonna die we're going into the back alley type fights seem to get more than the gun then then the anti gun or do you think there was a reason for that or was it just the other group of so vocal\n[noise] ah I think your polling data show that they were better off [noise] and to push that one out front by the gun issue of the upcoming midterm election is\nOkay that would make absolute perfect sense of polling data did come into an awful lot of play there a real quick let me just go to Bloomberg now because it's not something I Want to spend a lot of time on and we're while we're on the subject of him we've got a couple of minutes\nIt turns out that on the fifth\nBloomberg was reported at a GOP USA and I guess uh they went to it from Washington Times\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly argued friday that guns needs to be kept out of the hands of minorities in order to keep them alive while speaking at the Aspen Institute Bloomberg Seventy two Ninety five percent of murders fall into a category\nA male minority between the ages of Fifteen and twenty five quoting cities need to get guns out of his group's hands and keep them alive the former three term ...\nSaid these kids think they're going to get killed anyway because all their friends are getting killed they just don't have any long term focus on anything it's a joke to have a gun it's a joke to pull the trigger to he said something like this a couple of years back we talked about my gosh I Wonder if any of us said that we'd be racist all day long if he's serious about that\n[noise] yeah I think he is serious about it that's his allegiance showing through a\nYou know ... ... the man I mean he really is a gotcha is and if you remember Artie ... issue is is a guy that thinks he knows how to run your life you can run on your own it really doesn't matter what your guts are sugary drinks I mean this guy is crazy I mean he won't he wants to cradle to grave take care of all of us in his batter\nHis way give us no freedom period\nYou know I always found it interesting out and we'll take this into the bottom of having to go into the break the next segment within a couple of more topics but always found it interesting just ironic\nTo me I found it humorous it was comical to me that while Bloomberg was the mayor of New York he was going after what you just said sugary drinks too much soda telling you people what to eat\nAnd here's this guy stands up at the podium and kicks off every year the Nathan's hotdog eating contest where these guys are shoving Seventy five hotdogs down their stomach after ten minutes\nAnd washing it down and they're serving all kinds of beer and soda and there he is up on the podium giving it a big kick off I always thought that was kind of ironic I guess if it if it brings money and attention it's okay\nBut if not just for you okay for me not for the type of thing with Michael Bloomberg always found that interesting\nBut I also find with is interesting because the largest fastest growing group of gun owners in America are minorities and you and I saw that together with the groups that we met with and heard speak at the G R PC twenty seconds to the break I'll let you take it away isn't that the case\nYeah we had lots of minorities people of color policy accomplished in Chicago or our our diversity is growing and of course that scares the anti gay marriage as well uh yeah ... yeah I mean you were going to win this battle over time it's just we have to stay in the fight\nNow we're staying in the fight that's for sure we're gonna continue to do it we'll talk a little bit when we come back with Alan Gottlieb direct you where to go where you can join us I'm a lifetime member heck I'll just tell you right now at\n... dot O.

takes us all\nAfghan puts it on the guy's cakes and other guys can pull them back from the gun it medium lead a guy protests he says something course we don't have audio\nOr this guy's name is Scott it's at the top gun range and kudos to Scott that he did an amazing job of controlling the gun control and he didn't checks and find out exploded immediately leaves again on the table takes the two gentlemen and starts to escort them immediately from the range from the area of live fire\nAnd it was great for my training at first one of us that work at this guy did amazing job\nEvery instructor every hour or so every range facility and by the way every certifying agency out there\nTo ask yourself or your people and argue as individuals if you put yourself in that role prepared things that we control someone in an emergent situation like that are too many aren't quite frankly far too many of these uh you know cheese that certify instructors actually have a really\nHard rules they spend more time telling\nInstructors not to touch students without asking permission to be very aware of liability or awkward or uncomfortable if there's a you know\nInter gender relationship kind of thing if it's a woman touching the banner of touching a woman there are so worried about the political correctness of it that more than my fears is that they're not reminding instructors and all that so that you very well may need to go hands on\nTo protect yourself and to protect others and that's what this are so whose name I only learned off the Internet his name is Scott get a great job of\nSo that first for the ... were real quick route route for listeners for your benefit ourselves range safety officer Rob go ahead please\nYeah that's absolutely so you've been there and you took this step as a as a customer a year range to intervene but you didn't actually go hands on you felt like a verbal\nYou know hey by the way buddy that's not okay probably at an earlier level or at a lower level of risk of course that's the way to go you know we don't want to touch people and we don't need to we don't want to physically control people we don't need to\nPut this are so solving need now I'll tell ya been on you know I'll be on fifty sixty ranges this year probably than on I don't know if I had to guess\nThree hundred four hundred ranges around the world in my lifetime he did the right thing\nOn the political side here's what I saw on the Internet all day long those guys should be banned those guys should be kicked off those guys especially that guy shouldn't have guns that guy should not be allowed back on that range I Hope he was banned I Hope that I never see him and the other end video\nAnd I have to ask myself now going a Second Amendment organization putting my political ad on is that the white message\nLet's put thing for me if the if the day the anti gun or is it the other side the that the vast majority of the guard orders I clean as I said sure going to have a gun\nAre we undermining the credibility of the argument that we should have mandatory training 'cause obviously I don't think we should have mandatory training\nDo I think we should encourage trained or I should have practice has a gun\nOr choir it in the public space of an indoor or outdoor ... absolutely\nBut what we need to do for a guy like that he died quite frankly that should be banned relate it needed to have your problem is he is he a charity problem that he has a mental ... intellectual problem understanding ... some sort of gotten absolutely but that's certainly right that there is a bit of a second I'm All right\nLet me let me stop you there let me stop you there for a second I tell you why because at first I'm thinking\n... I I can see the emotional response get those guys the hell out of there they should be banned permanently but what you're saying it was what I Want you to understand what's going to wait a minute that's not the guy that needs to be bad that's the guy that has a ... he's a he's a lawful order\nHe's got terrible technique in bad faith the habit that's the guy that needs to be corrected that's the guy that needs to be on the range taking training\nPreparing understands long before graduation tone ... books on them to be you know and then can can learn Kim ...\nMedal anyway that one might not be motivating\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] I'm\nA\nFormer marine officers studio [laughter] American or even you know the white hair arm because the last woman to get here and we're making the second amendment by\nHim have very strong supporter of the second amendment\nInforming hand Andrew training responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast theories your host farmed American radio\nMars walls her\nSide of the ... studios with\nUs our one in the books Mr Alan Gottlieb is amazing and this is just more information than a human being should have boy oh boy I tell you what if having the opportunity to sit down with him and have dinner when you real quick I'm Talking about my dinner deer PC two weeks ago Tom Gresham and I sat down without and his wife and had dinner\nTalk about a great time good heavens in the company of greatness in the company of greatness just I'm just just really something can't tell you about the conversation yet\nBut I Know I'm going to be [laughter] you know won't be too long I can promise you guys all good it's all good but Alan Gottlieb he just brings it he just brings it simple that\nAnd a quick rundown next week I Will be in Phoenix, Arizona the value of the some of my favorite place on earth my front license plate says desert rat and it's got a picture of the Arizona desert in the sun going down and just beautiful people look at the truck all the time and so you're a desert right so you're saying\nIt's got to love it hadn't back up the weather's going down out in the desert can be in the high sixties at night and I'm going to do two days into stone and you will probably get one broadcast at least from tombstone Arizona for the daytime shovel will be Monday one week from tomorrow\nWe'll see how the new technology works with some of the\nSome of the systems out there into some but I broadcast it from there before it's an awful lot of fun so Saturday\nIf you're in Arizona ABCD a meeting I Will be there at the Sheraton in Phoenix you can check it out an easy easy easy CDL dot org find out by ticket show up comes shake pause be a bunch of us there it's a great organization doing that Saturday Night broadcasting Sunday from Phoenix\nGetting together with my good friend a W.

R. Hawkins thanks from the word go from the moment Kavanaugh was nominated to right now today hey W are tell us what give us your thoughts on this process\nProcess will surrenders and or the Democrats are shameless what Chuck Schumer spoke yesterday and he said that it you know he said Republicans are the ones who came in with an agenda that short cut this they vilified that they did\nIt he was a lot of Democrats did all those things that Democrats\nDid everything short of the salt that man and a ... fine is unbelievable what I think with those things said and I I Can't say anything good about is the Democrats except\nA credit to Joe metrics or voted for him I Will say that but\nUh\nWhat you've got now you have a Supreme Court justice who shows that he will not with force even that whether under pressure we have a tremendous justice maybe the most conservative justice on the court says Thomas and Thomas is still there or Scalia or so it just like they have set up for vote\nAds back into that we are Republican Party that's fired up I mean Lindsey Graham has been better the\nTV for me and Lindsey Graham what he did Trump showed even away but he missed it and then suddenly adult on and get missed it and he corrected his air and the way is ... ... people chess all the politically correct chains\nAnd the moment you do that but left is no power over you know when you cast them off you suddenly realize what these people can do to me they've just been forcing me to cower in my corner and as soon as he cast them all\nHe turned it made a mockery of the very people who used to crazy\nAnd so I think we as we have a justice was going to be unconditional in his love for the second amendment and we have Republican Party it may have finally learned how to fight it is that's true and if we have those things under President Trump then Katy bar the door because here we go\nBoy I tell you a whole lot of meat in that let me let me take let me take two things that you that you mentioned that were great import all if it was and you're a student of this stuff and that's why I wanted to ask you this I Know you study this you read this you watch this you ingest it you inhale it you breathe that I mean I Know this is who you are\nSo let's whatsoever another round of beers here and some more chicken wings make mine hot please and I'll have another cold glass hey W are you just mentioned mansion and you said God Bless him for voting this way let me throw something else that you and I'm going to get your comments on this\nThe hell with matching mentioned needs to go mansions not a man mentioned couldn't stand up mansion had to wait to see how Susan Collins voted before he could vote now the reason I say this is because West Virginia you're listening right now\n[noise] why couldn't match should have said that before Collins voted because Manchin is playing politics with this vote\nHe had to wait to get political cover so he could show it was okay was humor that he could get away with it because once Collins said I'm gonna go nothing could hurt mansion at that point in other words I'm telling you mentioned playing you for a\nDamn fool tell me if I'm wrong W. are\nLow you're right on that I Would I Would suggest the other was all that but I'm just saying I Am glad he crossed over the call right\nNow with Kathy Griffin road map on Twitter which she can't quit doing uh she's just angry I think she's angry at out she looks at it wouldn't be I think she's angry at how she sounds like she's angry at our careers down and\nWent and change that you can tweet or say you was the great that that he was confirmed with bipartisan support he they'll never be able to take that away from\nThat right about you're you're right you are absolutely correct about that I had to throw some devil's advocate out there I I got to be honest with you mentioned I think West Virginia it's time for you to wash your clothes you need a conservative in there you don't need somebody that you need somebody that's going to stand up and say you know what\nI don't vote lockstep with Chuck Schumer you know what you need you\nNeed somebody like Murkowski on your side of the fence\nOr\nGet right to go after January ... West Virginia the vote to Morsi there is no doubt about it yeah I'm not suggesting otherwise I'm not even suggested people should think otherwise I'm just saying what ...\nDid and I agree with your harp said political give or take a position until they knew that that position wouldn't hurt him politically but by what he ended up doing is giving us the opportunity to look at it in ... in the spring and say hey it's great that he was ... ... ...\n... you're absolutely correct you're you're correct and I wasn't insinuating that you were suggesting otherwise I just wanted to throw that out mass 'cause he's so easy to Iraq I'm going to go into him in the next hour when I'm On my own and have some fun with them now Graham\nOh boy you know we talked last week about gram off there and I think that Lindsey Graham is woke to use the Urban Dictionary term right I think he's woke what I Want to know from you is what took so long why could you and I and others and gun owners owners\nReal conservative see this ten years ago and he couldn't or others couldn't or McConnell couldn't or other Republicans why and you got about a minute\nI don't know I have thought on this and part of a thing and I'm just this is only my opinion\nPartly thinks that the influence of McCain work that great on him because he and McCain were that close they really are that's really all I can come up with me and I'm right but I'll tell you what it don't matter what it was I loved that Lindsey Graham I'm seeing right now and I made it uh the guy is awesome\nThe first time mark the ... the founder and the designer of the original super talking God rest his soul for\nIt's been hard believes been so long since he passed away already but I remember one more call me says do me a favor I heard you talking about this on the radio don't give up inside the waistband carry yet try my holster\nAnd boy I tell you your reaction was very similar to mine on that of the ... the way it dissipates the weight is worthy of note because I wouldn't have believed it when you looked at it originally I thought this can't possibly be boom I forgot I had a full size locked up until ... W are\nBut but and with the sap slide you made me think of something else with the ... but can't owned a gun is perfect and ah but yeah\nWith with with the super talk and I think I've said this radio before before I said at the first time I said I shouldn't say what I'm saying is in a I Know I was taking a nap twice for the Supreme Court going and my gun and that just 'cause I literally it it's so comfortable back there I don't think about\nMy gun being on them and that's the only way I can tell you because when you for me I just don't like it inside the way Spain Carrie ... or a a unless it's extremely small or whatever in Italy but then when you realized is what the cross free\nBut the super ... does everything has a purpose it's hot\nIt's hot water than a normal host or because they're sloppy it's lot taller than another host or because they're sloppy or didn't plan it out it dissipates the presidents and later that gun and when you put that super technical and you will forget your carrying a gun and\nUh you know I don't mean that at a reckless fashion obviously that's the kind of ... we're talking about I found that same comfort with snaps lots\nYou know the and the outside the waste man it's it's really true I got to take this reminder to tell the story about this about mark I have to because it's a great story I did a commercial for them I ... a TV\nPiece or camera peace with them telling the same story but\nMarket heard me talking mark credit and founder of cross breed it'd be many years ago had heard me talking about how I of essentially given up on WB inside the waistband Kerry from my full size got I just couldn't find anything that works I got a number of great manufacturers in a number of great super high quality ... they just were not working for me\nAnd he heard me swear off on that and you heard me say I was lucky I Lived in Georgia and outside the waistband Carey was not going to be a problem and he called me and he said wait\nDon't give up let me send you this holster\nAnd I want you to try to I Want you to do me if they want you to get up when you get up in the morning at seven thirty more time you get up I Want you to put it on and what you put your gun in it and when she worked for twenty four hours don't take it off\nAnd that's exactly what I did I got the host chair on a Saturday I went to work and broadcast it on a Sunday put that thing on seven thirty in the morning I wore it all day long broadcasted in it came back and as I Want to do on Sundays after the monster chalet W I fell asleep on the couch woke up about seven o'clock the next morning forgot I had it on\nUntil I got up and went upstairs and take a shower that's how comfortable that whole era was but then I told the I've taught that story\nMany many many times in and I know that you you experienced and I thought it was just a cool story to tell I called markets you God thank you he said I Want to participate on your show I said You're welcome to and we've been to cross breed holster studios ever since it's just a remarkably design a piece of piece of equipment and we've got thirty seconds did you want to close it out real fast\nBut yeah I mean the host or just remarkable but as I say both of 'em are but yeah it says\nYou can tell nothing nothing on these soldiers as they are by chance and materials chosen the way they're put together everything while at least ... is a winner and that's the bottom line what you're inside the waistband or outside the either way you go ... or ... it's a winner\nAnd I'll tell you regardless to of what gun you carry I've I've got a whole slew of guns in my safe and I have a cross breed forever virtually every single one of them and it doesn't matter whether it's whether it's a small sub compact whether it's a full size Nineteen eleven men [noise]\nIt really has got a little bit off the track there but I'm Glad we did was it was a great great conversation I Hope you check them out cross breed holster dot com\nWhen they do if you are often some ripe our news and All right\nThank him for Microsoft Carl Hurley goes no option for people because if I don't know that there is but you actually has to be sixty five Gary\nFire I think I'm the plight of ...

Wells Fargo for just a second because I think there's something here and but if you think I'm nuts I Want you to tell me but I don't think I Am in this case Wells Fargo is you know I'm a you know that I'm a big student of the Old West history how I'm going to be in tombstone Arizona for like the twenty fifth time a week from Monday\nI go there just to get away and I tried to get out there at least once a year for a couple of days to me it's just I'm\nCalling it's just a place for me to go I can shut everything off and I can sit where Wyatt Earp and ... that and I can have dinner and I can show up relaxing the Old West and to me the ... the history just fascinates me but you know Wells Fargo was well known for its states coaches isn't it\n\nThere's that used to have the Wells Fargo treasure box\nTake a listen to this gold dust gold bars gold coins legal papers checks and draft traveled in the famous green treasure box is stored under the stage coach driver's seat\nLoaded with ... they could wave from a hundred two hundred and fifty pounds quote about as much as one likes to shoulder to and from the stages wrote John cue Jackson Wells Fargo agent in an Eighteen fifty four letter to his father\nBecause they carry the most valuable assets of the west\nThese dirty boxes of ponderosa pine folk and I are more and more prized by highway banded than anything else I'll listen to this\nBut the real security of the treasure box is came from who was guarding them the Wells Fargo shot gun messengers\nThey were quote the kind of men you can depend on if you got into a fix unquote according to Wells Fargo detective Jim him if these were foolhardy enough to try and steal a treasure box and transit they would find themselves staring down the barrel of a sawed off shotgun loaded with double what buckshot possibly held by Wyatt Earp himself\nDespite these efforts there was a mass highway man who managed to Rob twenty seven states coaches the infamous black bart Wells Fargo detectives eventually caught up with him he served his four years in San Clinton and then disappeared forever and this is a it was three is wonderful story rich in American history this is a\nCompany that was built and survive on a God is it any its shock to anyone that Wells Fargo would continue to do business with us would that shock anybody at all it doesn't shock me at all why what did shock you what do you think\nYou know and so now the trigger is too it's clear that they are\nI mean it's Wells Fargo for crying out loud of course they're going to land the gun industry some money good heavens what's that you you say what what Sean you said\nI bank rhythm you back with them yeah yeah I've got some business interests with them over there a little bit All right let's go back to somebody I think I just think that's fascinating stuff and I appreciate your writing about it in the history of it is it's fascinating to me\nAll right we've got the armed customer over there we talked a little bit about him I you know I got to go to a this guy is Seventy four year old Vietnam vet\nWho wanted\nThis this guy shot seven cops AWOL Hawkins seven tops\nRight killed one wounded six\nAll right do we know anything about this at this stage of the game\nYou know uh you know I I'll probably know in the morning a Kavanaugh this sucked up the air so much Friday Saturday\n... it's it's certainly did go ahead\nBut yeah this uh this is a weird situation they were going to bed house circle worn very upscale neighborhood award was not for the Seventy four year old Vietnam\nThat it was four twenty seven year old male and the house or in the war was on suspicion of child molestation or or child sexual assault something like that just so weird to me that\nThe person who was not the target of the search warrant open around the place and uh you know there's there are dogs to be connected here but um\n[noise] that's one of those stories it's news works it's one of those stories it happened\nUh it just happened to happen the day before the Kevin Oh just suck the era of the room and uh so everything everything other than Kavanaugh was getting no here so it's just put it that way and so uh I'll Try to do a follow on this law is\nI'd be curious to find out about what some of those dots are it's a very strange story and we've got seven police officers in South Carolina that were shot one killed one of them Thirty years on the job unbelievable I don't want to find out what happened there All right I'm I'm just curious or Russia collusion more oh where's that Ben\nHaven't heard any backed up that bring that back and now that Kevin Oh\nYou know once they get get get done standing in the kitchen or wherever they are and then within themselves with all the change and whatever else they're doing once they're done with that\nThey don't go back to Russia collusion and all the other stuff that's not real or just to try to keep it going but you know what I'm going to say mark you remember during Sandy Hook a ... you remember I hate to use the word but there was a fear on the part of gun owners that right you know there was what was\nGoing to push through gun control but they they overreached as usual and they showed their hand their cigarette out hold on the street corner and I have to also make a difference there just after more control I think\nThey did the same thing with what they did the cab or no and I believe that when they circled back for Russia now than when they circle back for all the other things now they're going to have a lot of trouble getting any kind of sympathy especially the kind they weren't getting maybe say even six seven weeks ago it's over\nThere and I I think their credibility proven that they are just a bunch of animals that's all\nAnd I think their credibility I think they've shown that their credibility whereas I talked about it and you know this you do too I Know you talk about it on your podcast and the two of us has spoken about with Curt Schilling on his show and we've discussed it here on this program over the last couple of years\nAnd that is that the Democrats in the media in particular has shown that all they're doing is driving and pushing a narrative they they're they're they're they're shaping the news the way they want you to get it then they move away from it they don't cover it anymore because they choose not to and then all of a sudden they're going to try to go back and I think what's going to happen is\nThat the rest of America who doesn't have their head in this stuff neck deep like we do every single day is going to look back when they circle back around to it and say well wait a minute here\nYou want to have money in your future taming now\nPutting some money from every paycheck until it's painting the counselors contributing to your Marlin came can make a big difference later than ... million by ... feet in the ... are now the the food that I learned that hey\nLet's just hope Steve twenty thirty seven doesn't get his hands on a cold time machine because he is going to come back here and knocks him since then to you\nDismiss this process you by the American Institute of certified public accountants and the ad council\n[noise]\n\n\nIt is a friday the well known that friday [noise] entire world the literature surrounding private [noise] up\nTo them indeed every body and there was a ... vote in the U.S Senate do they you know the words\nTo vote to put the vote on the justice for a vote [noise] you\nCannot closed debate and culture it's cold\nAnd\nYou cannot extrapolate necessarily from that vote to how they will vote in actuality so you can vote for cloture and then vote against\nBrett Kavanaugh so and there's not a given at all in my mind that he will be nominated by a spy or chosen ratified ... confirmed by the U.S so there's not a given\nI heard and I have to verify heard that a Republican senator from Montana and will be attending his daughter's wedding he's walking down the aisle\nOn Saturday So that would deprive the Republicans of another vote\nAlready Lisa Murkowski she even voted against cloture now it's theoretically possible she would vote for Kavanaugh having voted for cloture but it's unlikely\n\nI just my heart breaks for the man and I don't know what else I can tell you\n[noise] I have made in my case from the beginning that it did not deserve the U.S Senate hearing you cannot make a high school accusation that has never been made against anyone Republican or Democrat with zero corroboration\nAnd have the United States Senate close its functions and entertain your\nCharge it just it wouldn't be done with anything else\nYou know we uh we we saw him in gay I saw him engage in an armed robbery and high school\nI think they would have stopped the U.S Senate for that hearing a fully credible person I saw Brett Kavanaugh engage than arm robbery armed robbery when he was a junior in high school and guess\nWhat I can mainly the people who uh who saw him do it and then every one of them says I don't know what the person's talking about including one of them who is a best friend\nOf the person making the accusation\nSo why is that why does the why does the U.S government shutdown why does the U.S population preoccupied with one charge from one woman from high school thirty five years ago why and we all know why\nBecause we live in the age as stated by\nA professor Alan Dershowitz at Harvard law school a lifelong liberal Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism that is why\n\nI I don't and he said it's darker rich a darker period than that and this is a liberal Democrat but one of the only ones who want to really liberals with courage liberals are not leftist but they are but they are very weak\nWill accept the case and the rare case of Alan Dershowitz who has told me personally and on film to me you will see it in my movie without a curl up no safe spaces next year it said to me that he is far more afraid of the left then over there\n\nWell listen to it and see he was all it took a call she was like\n\nThis is the loser the sexual McCarthyism right I mean think of it ladies and gentlemen I Wonder if somebody had said he committed murder in high school whether they would have been a hearing\nI doubt it you have any collaboration you have a dead body\nYou have witnesses\nNo and no on all counts I'm Sorry murder is the worst thing that a person can engage in nevertheless we can stop the engines of government of the United states of America because one person makes warm I'm corroborate a charge of murder\nTell me where by analogy is by analogy you an improper\nColey tell tell me you are listening tell me why this happened\nOn what grounds were the hearings held to this is what I this is what I said from the beginning I was attacked by conservatives in the Washington Post National Review and elsewhere and by maintain that my original position was correct\nAll these conservatives do\nUh is feed the beast yes look at what you can do to ruin a man's reputation man who hundreds of women of all backgrounds in of all political persuasion Z have affirmed that such a decent man\n\nI I'm not sure that I have witnessed something like this in my lifetime and we've had this performance Clarence Thomas Clarence Thomas ... who is still used as a poster boy for sexual\nHarassment at worst he is accused of talking a mentioning sexual matters in a conversation with a a was a would be ...\n\nUh I I happen for the record I happen to think that it's unwise to do I have not done that\nAnd I'm not a proponent of it I but I think it needs to be put in to perspective I mean this is is it the statement of a woman cannot even hear talk about sexual matters\nIt is so it is so devastating\nIt is I don't think is a is affirmative of females strength I don't defend it but I I'm Talking about how\nHow awful is it in the perspective of the awfulness of the people are capable of problem is in the United states of America things are so good for so many people that they are they exaggerated view\nSin takes place I don't mean religious sects circular say\n\nWhat we are this is what we have witnessed though the closing down of the machine machinery of government they weren't willing to go to California\nThe entire Senate Judiciary committee are you aware of that that was their argument will come to you when she said she was afraid of flying they made an offer of going to her whole committee\nOr representatives of the committee are not the whole company has some very important to have some accuracy on this program but the one who how whatever the number they were willing to go to her and it is because we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism just\nAs Alan Dershowitz ... that's the issue\nBut I I don't think in real McCarthyism in the actually you were in the Nineteen fifties I don't I don't know I simply don't know I I from acknowledge this if one person had said\nAbout a Supreme Court nominee I Know he's he's pro communist that's after all what because ... is charged with unfairly characterizing decent people's communists just like we have on fair charging of of people have sexual predators\nRight and and people don't know that with the with the tax cuts there's more tax revenue going to the government\nThat that's the nature we are seeing an increase in the tax revenue to the treasury um because of the increase in economic activity and and that's fantastic people are
