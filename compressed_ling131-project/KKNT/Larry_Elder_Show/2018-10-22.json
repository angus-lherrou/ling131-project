Bush being called a racist that's why I'm actually one is called George Herbert Walker Bush or racist that's why the less calls Donald Trump or racist\nWho's going to go for a racist just random racist\nNow you might be persuasive if they didn't do it all the time\n\nWould have William clay and a member of the house say about Ronald Reagan when he's running Ronald Reagan got his racist precepts from mine cops are you kidding me\n\nJulian Bond the head of the ... in double ACP said that George W.

that beautiful place you'd if you if you know anything about me at all I've been doing this monster show with you know we're in our ten year never missed the show in ten years very proud of that\nAnd if you've been listening and many of you have\nBeen listening for those ten years as a show continues to explode two hundred plus radio stations now lord knows however many venues other than that exist out there I'm not even aware of okay probably some affiliates I'm not even aware of but nonetheless if you've paid any attention to me at all over the last ten years you know\nMy affinity for the great state of Arizona love it love it I'm drawn to it can't explain why don't really care but feel very comfortable feel very home there\nAnd I spent some time out there last week\nAnd I'm ready to roll now\nBut I got a disclaimer for hundreds of thousands of you tuned in to the A R Daily Show tune into the Daily Show alive\nAnd by podcast in particular and I work in a couple of ... over a couple of dozen or thirty I forget about thirty armed American radio station affiliates if you've been tuned into a our daily program this week and many many of you are just mentioned from Wednesday on actually from Monday on\nYou might hear a little bit of similar discussion in our one and our three our one will be different because I've got a guess on that you've never heard before will be going to him momentarily but in our three I Will be bringing my tombstone adventure to this program\nFrom Monday's broadcast from tombstone where I spoke with the mayor dust and ask a pool and activist and hotel owner businessman entrepreneur ... owner if Larry a motel give them a big plug out there in Tucson, Arizona Mr Gordon Anderson\nAnd Alan Gottlieb because Alan Gottlieb ... years you know if he was in the daytime show we're into stone Arizona on Monday and Tuesday broadcasting from that living breathing history museum that's what tombstone is\nSo we'll talk a little bit about that tonight with my upcoming guests you'll find them fascinating we'll go to him and just a minute but want to throw that disclaimer out that I'm going to run that our\nFrom Tucson from tombstone Monday show because I had just an amazing conversation with the mayor and with Gordon there's some big things going on in tombstone relative to your right to keep and bear arms they're thinking big out there I'll tell you about it and just a little bit\nSo enjoyed that third our as I bring it to this monster cast I Want you to hear it on this giant enormous show and two hundred affiliates that don't get to hear the daytime show you're going to love it so let me start with why was I in Arizona to begin with\nThe Arizona citizens defense league [noise] excuse me they asked me to speak I have three or four times now I I I've lost count but I Love speaking of that event each year I'm a life member now so here's kind of my progression of\nMy speaking relationship with the folks out at Arizona citizens eventually I actually woke up in tombstone Arizona a number of years ago put my genes on through on a shirt strapped on a firearm\nPut my stepson on put my fry boots on stuck\nA gun on my hip and drove to Tucson to speak to the Arizona citizens defense league meeting and I thought that was kind of cool when it dawned on me man I woke up in Tucson, Arizona today put my boots my ... my gun on\nIt came up here to Tucson to speak to\nOne of the greatest pro gun rights organizations grassroots organizations in the country I thought that was kinda cool to me that school so because I Love Arizona and protect in particular I Love to just don't\nTrust that was when I was a basic member of the organization at that time card carrying the next year I spoke as a sustaining member in Phoenix and then a couple of years later this year\nI speak as a life member and I couldn't be more proud of that fact\nSo this year\nI ended up with Alan Gottlieb and who you hear on the program founder of a Second Amendment foundation usually hear around every week Allen I've been planning on personal trip the tombstone for just a couple of days to get out what turns out\nThat Gordon Anderson who we met in shots show in Vegas a couple of years ago invited us out along with the mayor of tombstone\nTo assist them with and appear at their freedom day celebration in honor of their proclamation of America's first proclaimed official Second Amendment city but it happened kind of quick and both of us were unable to get out there in June for personal reasons so we came out there\nThis past week now\nHad already pre planned his trip so it was an awful lot of fun to pop into town out an eye on Monday we stayed until Tuesday we brought to live armed American radio daily shows from that living breathing history museum I've also broadcasted from tombstone in the past a number of years ago about four years ago as well\nSo we were there for a number of reasons not just the history in the front of the town but we were working both days in fact Alan ... USA Today op ed piece from malaria motel and assisted me a production of both radio program so not all play I could sure use a lot of work going on\nBut here's the fun part and you're going to hear this in the third our today as I bring you the actual daily program for Monday This week from tombstone where my first guest was the tombstone mare\nDustin ask a pool who unbeknownst to Alan Gottlieb myself prior to the program presented each of us with an honorary citizen of Tucson plaque\nAlong with two golden keys to the city now again if you know anything about me that's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me because I've been going out to Tucson for twenty five plus years\nSo to have that to me it was an absolute incredible honor I had no idea that he was going to do that and it took both of us by surprise I have that ... sitting right here and I can promise you that's the coolest thing and I have a lot of cool things on the wall studio I can promise you from NASCAR stuff to gun stuff\nTo this this right here ranks right up there AS number one or at least tied for number one\n[noise] but I got to tell you what were we doing there why were we there because we're beginning assisting that incredible little town with their upcoming freedom day celebration in June of twenty Nineteen next year where I can promise you will be there\nThey're thinking big into stone and they want our help and we are more than happy to assist them\nAnd we will be bringing some big names to that town in June I Can't give you the ... who's who yet as it's building and we've got to reach out to a number of people but let's just say there will be a number of huge national celebrity figures as\nIn fact it to be out there pro gun rights celebrities yeah hard to find right but they're out there some of them made movies that you might be familiar with like why it happened to them so you know that kind of stuff\nIn fact right now about tumors into stone as I speak to you right now we got into town today we're hopeful that maybe we can bring him back again\nIn June he's been there before but the list is building for movie stars to talk radio host that you listen to and see on national TV politicians newsmakers\nSo it's going to be a giant enormous event in tombstone and we want you to make the pilgrimage with us there will be more on that over upcoming shows in months as we get closer to June to believe they just got to be on you like that just going to happen so we'll have more on this throughout the year but suffice to say you'll hear a lot about it\nIn the third our specifics about it\nIs I talked to two of the city of tombstone movers and shakers Mr Gordon Anderson and married Dustin basketball who by the way that the conversation with him which is fascinating his family history you know he's going to tell you about it in the third our but it is just extremely cool one of the victims\nKilled by the perks at the gunfight at the OK Corral had eighty dollars in his pocket given to him\nBy the ... great grandfather for payments earlier that day that's the kind of cool stuff I'm Talking about the I Love that stuff so it's a ton of fun you don't want to miss the show if you've heard it if you heard it on Monday This week or or any of the hundreds of thousands upon cast listeners enjoy the encore remembering that the vast majority of\nThis huge weekend monster cast audience is tasting it for the first time okay coming up in the second hour from Breitbart News award winning journalist today our weekly contributor and political analyst the one and only Dr ...

there you can find them strolling across the bottom of the page a norm leaving some out I Apologize\nLet's get back over to Johnny rolling Johnny about one more segment laugh I'm going to read you an email that said okay this is an interesting email\nLet me ask this up who set this up for a\nWhile I was in Arizona I was talking a when I was at the ... this broadcast the monster broadcast Sunday broadcast last week\nIn Arizona at the Sheraton I was talking about how Arizona is widely regarded as the most gun friendly state the country and it is and that's because of the method of care you don't need a permit you go to Carrie binding citizen to go to Arizona carrier got simple as that carrier don't take it with you the Arizona feel free however I made the comment I\nSee more no guns allowed signs in Arizona on one trip that I see in Thirteen Years of living in Georgia\nOkay there's a reason up here's here's an email Matthew Murphy writes and mark tombstone is now Second Amendment city on yesterday's daily defense you mentioned that there were all kinds of signs around tombstone saying no guns allowed how can I claim\nTo be a Second Amendment city when all the establishment to say no guns allowed now let me give you my answer they don't want to turn it over to you\nMatthew that's a great question I've heard it before here's why it's Arizona State law it comes from alcohol serving establishments predominantly I don't think I've ever seen a no gun sign at a at a hat at a stepson\nOr gift shop if you will it only seems to be in restaurants serve alcohol now those signs in Arizona do carry the weight of law\nWhat I mean by that is if you walk into that establishment in violation of it sit at the bar and have a beer you can't be charged with criminal trespass immediately and the signage in Arizona doesn't have to meet a certain standard some owners of those establishment for whatever reason\nAs their owners have decided they don't want you when you can walk away now I have spoken and I won't name two of the popular bars in in tombstone I'm only in them by name doesn't matter Johnny but I've spoken to the owners of them on both occasions and\nBoth times I got the same response we would prefer you didn't but if you want to\nUh let us know and we'll check it for you\nNow on the Arizona law for ... if if if a business tells you and has a sign that says no guns allowed they by law in Arizona have to provide you\nA safe storage for that firearm while you weren't there most businesses don't believe it or not are not in compliance of that but that's why that is that the alcohol serving establishment Johnny you want to take that email from their\n... and you're right Omar pretty much and realized that uh you know we have people from all over the country over the world comes to stop and and some of these folks are are not familiar\nWith guns and they want to make a statement and then also you got some people that are just on the Gulf trouble so so\nWhat that is an insurance policy against someone told me and drinking too much and having a fire or maybe not knowing how to handle it again but er visits or someone that might not be familiar with was just how this goes and\nAnd you know personally and look the law is that if you you can go if there's no sign there you can take your government a ball boys to serve alcohol threat but you're not you're but but you can't drink\nYou got to say a ... if you got you know drink and so that's that's how that works\nAnd I got to stop you there too 'cause I got to throw this disclaimer into Johnny and that is Arizona is a constitutional carry permit let's carry state you do not need a permit in hand to carry a firearm in Arizona however\nIn order to carry into an establishment that serves alcohol you must have a permit constitutional Kerry is brilliant permit let's carry is prohibited sea so Matthew I what I'm telling you hear is it's the it's really state law that's in play here and not every bar and restaurant have that side\nBut there are a lot to do and and when you're in an area like Scottsdale like I'm at which is lots of bars and great restaurants you tend to see more of them in Arizona because state law allows for that\nAnd it does carry the weight of law you still have anti people out there even though it's a gun friendly state so I Hope I answered your question Johnny did you want to put an exclamation point on that\nI think he did really well and you're right and uh personally uh I just prefer not to freak all the places are going well maybe by ... on it you know a\nSimple but I'll go to where I can because again the bad\nPeople to the criminal is not going to do all of a sudden you know a a in an amazing how we see countries that that wall to disarm there's too many people go out there with their little signs that say oh I Want my mail\nBut you know a sub don't work very well just bullets or not the real food that amazing\nYeah they also don't work out they don't work well against no food or drink and studio either hold on one second\n[laughter]\nI was getting a little bit thirsty there are so yeah there you go up and I'm a ice cold water and you know a lot of these expensive equipment in here Johnny's you well know now there is a W I wrote this up on the twenty first which is today and I wanted to get your opinion on this with the last minute that we have\nGun control group urging people to Texas authorities and report armed citizens and the name of the group is guns down America let's see where they're at USA Today quota guns down America director I ... ...\nSaying given the troubling political rhetoric we've seen over the last two years and the guns are far too easy to obtain this campaign will help the majority of Americans who believe that fewer guns keep us safe or\nFight back and cast their ballots free from fear of intimidation well you know I just read that for the first time here's what it ought to say\nGiven the troubling political rhetoric from the left that we've seen over the last two years and that bonds are far too scary for those on the left this campaign will help the majority of ... who don't trust Americans feel a little better my response to that is go to hell what's your response to that one\nWell I'll tell you what a ... we have a special program and its coal adopted him if you have a gun out there they're struggling you at home\nAnd and you feel like it's a problem because we have families waiting to except you're going to go\nHere and there is\nWe can actually started his show\nI haven't spoken about to show me the issue\nOf all to see how it played out [noise]\nTo abuse the man was murdered [noise]\nBased on anything anybody can imagine it's indefensible morally indefensible crime was committed against them and [noise]\nThere's a lot about the man that I don't know I don't know what his views where he is portrayed as a liberal in Saudi Arabia against an autocratic regime\nBut they're all the reports about him but no matter what his views that this is obviously not something we can morally accept the question that looms larger than that however is why is there so much attention being paid here\nDissidents or regime opponents in the middle east are routinely murdered ...\n... it's one of the great puzzles of life but I think I have an answer to this one but it is often a puzzle as to why something dominate the news and something else doesn't\nThe Saudi or the Saudi regime that got rid of someone wanted to get rid of\nAnd now in the year twenty eight Jean this ease international\nNews to the extent that it is an ongoing daily story\n\nGiven how many people who who oppose Assad get tortured to death\nOr a ... a regime or in other off African regimes other Arab countries over most of them countries they have any people have been tortured to death in Iran can you remain warden\nSo why why is this so much of a fixation the question is not whether or not we accept what happened was the\nQuestion is why is there a fixation on this may well one reason as he wrote columns for the Washington Post so we have a connection to the west and specifically to the United states and the other is that we have\nPhotographic data\nRegards to I mean there man walks into a consulate and never walk south it's pretty damning where we have that on video we have a video of our men and dreams\nAnd we have the information about those men and during turkey and then leaving turkey so everything is obvious why the Saudi regime or elements of the Saudi regime would want to get rid of this man that's a puzzle to me did you ever hear of this guy\nI I'm I immersed myself in world affairs and I never heard of the guy\nAnd and and by the way and if you read the column so they're not exactly a set to leaving or revealing or or anything I mean it's the Washington Post talk to the Saudi right around a lot of understand that fine I Wish they had an Iranian writer\nWho was who was a dissident with a guy would be a dead on arrival the away\nSo here's my theory as to why they're such preoccupation with this ban\nThere are two reasons in my opinion one is Saudi Arabia's ally of the United states and the the media are far more preoccupied with\nThe bad things that allies do than the bad things that enemies to\nYeah you might want to ask why because I don't know fully this is a physicist now speculation\n\nThey would I think they would argue we we have influence on allies we don't have influence on enemies\nTherefore\nOn those that we can influence we should try to have some influence that's the most noble read of the preoccupation with the deprivation of allies as opposed to the deprivation of enemies\nRight there's ... there's nothing on the dissidents in Iran and when you run did in fact have an uprising during the\nDuring the Obama administration he essentially said nothing and the the ... that was defended by the entire liberal slash left media because it was ... bomber\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is it you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people think well up themselves\nAnd we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention something terrible that they're an ally of the United states is the second reason\nIs that he is not only an ally of the Saudi regime was not only in LA of the United states is an ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left is about Kim Jong un and it is about the Ayatollah Khamenei me\nAnd that is not the end is knocked Bush shot out of ... it is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media because worlds maybe by the left and the left hates him more than any one and if she has a friend the friend is hated\n\nThose are the two reasons so why are we supposed to do here is the question on the tape what are we supposed to do we can't deny and it's because it's it would be a lawyer and you can tell lies cat that I went to Saudi regime that does it go up all the way to the crown prince we don't know\nBut it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently\nWho are engaged in this murder so what are we supposed to do [noise]\nCancel a hundred billion dollars what what is this something that they ever ordered\nIt and then five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well listen morale will be more important than jobs to which the answer is what is ... ... yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there are two big caviar tier\nOne is jobs is a moral issue it's not\nIt's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can all of a naval tens of thousands of Americans to work\nBut if but murder is murder I I I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of moral bad that's a very big component of wind moral thinking\nBut the a lot of save the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two and most important if you really want to talk more real than the greatest moral good right now might be in the world the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside of its borders\nIt's it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the ... the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that light or a more decent place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater goods the most obvious example being a man of didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nGift that figure because it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that he was slaughtering people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works not the way we imagine we allowed to Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shah to step down in Iraq\nThat murder of cars showcase despicable\nIn life the question is not only correctly labeling bad\nAs bad acts it's what do you do about them afterwards\n[laughter]\nThat's that's the way it works on ... in the real world the real world is not pleasant and then the real world you will fight evil with people who are morally troubled\nThemselves\nAnd in this case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nRight\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings if the Democrats take control the Senate Dianne Feinstein his so deteriorated visit moral figure\nOr because of the running against they radical leftist she's just the regular leftist Kevin delay I'm\nSo for her the issue is how do I win\nNot bought his right they will open hearings again on the Supreme Court justice I Want you to understand something about the Democratic party today because it's a left wing liberal party\nEvery institution it doesn't control it wishes to destroy you realize that\nIt doesn't control the electoral college wishes to destroy it\nDoes and wishes to and the electoral college it doesn't control the Supreme Court for the first time in my lifetime and in the lifetime of any of the senators show it calls the court illegitimate that it's a regular phrase\nThe the court there's no longer a Supreme Court is no longer seen as legitimate because it's not left if it's not left it's not legitimate the or understand\nIt's a force for chaos left isn't it as a false surely a tornado of destruction\nNow where was the article about how the Senate protects white voters against black voters and Hispanic voters did you see that it was the Washington Post I think but it might have been to New York times\nThey hate the Senate because the Senate like the electoral college is state based not population based\n[noise] this is the United states of America the states or to have their own worlds indeed genius I could cry about the genius of the founders of this country\nAnd their genius they wanted ... moral societies as at work coal states to see which one works because they didn't they weren't so arrogant just to think they knew exactly what would work and\nThat's why we have ... states\nSo now everything they don't control\nIs it legitimate won a prayer seven seven second movement\nDennis trigger show live from the relief factor pain free
