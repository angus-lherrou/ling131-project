to talk to you about in terms of ah ... how the resistance is manifesting itself in our nation's capital to great articles today terrific articles\nThat are in from two completely different publications explaining exactly how the organized resistance left has been undermining this president since day one and continue to do so and it's stuff you don't really see in the papers necessarily but just as insidious if not as dangerous as\nThe protests in the streets I'm going to get to that in a moment but first I Want to tell you about our police the brand new book by marks dad jak live

it and God Knows they're not getting this message\nFrom the public schools or or from television these days so please get our police you can prevent her to them as on by jak within that's marks dad and I know that the ... family will appreciate that\nLet's start with the wall Street Journal or the headline in their editorial today\nEnding the nominations blockade\nKeep Democrats in DC until every pending nominees confirmed now I Know mark talks a lot about what Mitch McConnell has been able to do\nA listen we have a lot of corals with Mitch McConnell is the majority leader in the Senate but in one respect he has done a woman's job and that is in getting judicial nominees through\nUh the president has done an incredible job with his advisors in nominating a fantastic judges and in the cases of Gorsuch and Kevin too fantastic justices\nAnd uh it as far as the Justice Department is concerned for as far as the\nJudicial branch of our government the Senate's been doing a pretty okay job in pushing through a lot of those nominees and a lot of those judges they could do more though\nWhat is not discussed very often\nEspecially because it's now almost two years into this administration what often does not get the attention that the mainstream media should be giving it is that as of now president Donald Trump\nHas something like a hundred and ... looking for the number within this article right now something like a hundred and eighty nominations\nFor for\nPositions within his administration that have nothing to do with the judicial branch have nothing to do with judges were talking about people in the state department people at the Pentagon that require confirmation by the United States Senate that are still sitting\nAnd still languishing without any action from the Senate\nMuch of it is because of the arcane rules of the Senate which as we know Mitch McConnell can change right now today\nAnd he has not\nAnd this is the resistance these are the Democrats Chuck Schumer he said he said going into this administration that he was going to make every single appointment of fight\nTo the death\nAnd and they would demand debate they would demand the time needed for you I think it's something like ... every single nominee that requires Senate confirmation or if they want to if they want to hold up the works they can put all of these roadblocks in\nThat end up being like Seventy hours of debate for each one and of course the ... in the past they haven't done that they've been deferential and they've said listen every\nPresident deserves the right and opportunity and leeway to put people in place that he has put in place and and selected to be put in place\nThat's called ...\n... ... ... it's called respect for our American government it's called a fundamental understanding that the executive branch of the United states federal government must be failed\nSo that they can function but the Democrats haven't allowed that to happen\nOr let me read this or much of its editorial for you so you understand what we're talking about anyone seeking a mid career sabbatical should seek a presidential nomination to a position that requires Senate confirmation Jewish majority leader Mitch McConnell is teeing up more votes this week and the GOP needs to move fast\nBecause the glacial pace of staffing the government will slow to near zero if Democrats retake the Senate it's it's pretty close to zero now guys\nMr McConnell has filed cloture on three nominees including two assistant attorneys general who have been in a rubber room for more than a year to assistance attorneys general have been waiting for their floor of vote for nearly a year\nThink about that\nYou want to know why the Justice Department has trouble functioning and doing things why they're spread a little ...\n\nWe can't we can't run a government this way\nAnd the Democrats are suppose they're supposed to be all about running the government they love the government why are they holding up this president and his nominations to fill basic function every rules in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have won\nAnd they're trying to make a life or living a health for this president may want dysfunction in the federal government\nThey can run in twenty twenty and saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do [noise]\nPresident Trump nominated Jeffrey ... Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nErica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which\nTop thirty hours of debate even if no senator as opposed to understand this but Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey bus or clerk to run the environment and natural resources division at the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed it to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees the Trump has put for remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the ambassador you and I would love that by the way back when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no bastard or Germany and and once he got there\nHe is he is with that continent into shape not just Germany he has been that the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nAnd Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists mullahs Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get record now as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from Iran all we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that is what Trump one way that it's because they didn't have as a master there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats file clerk sure this is a Senate rule that can be changed in should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator Foust cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate let's think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now that are languishing\nFor each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\n\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations two to four votes because we can't just health progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a day and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single culture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to muck up the works they just want to slow everything to a grinding halt\nThe media\nAmes in your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to your teeth power swamps is the\nFive minutes solution to

majorities in the house and the Senate it's going to go one way or the other\nAnd and so and when we we have to be a part of that\nThere's no way we can sit back and let the mob take over and then that's why you're seeing the CNN and the Washington Post and Democrat as little as I say that you can't call them a mob\nWhen you see in taking to the streets and disrupting traffic and stopping your car from going down the street and a a burning things on the campus of a public college because as a conservative is about to give a speech or storming into a private restaurant\nAnd screaming until an elected official leaves so that people can at least that's what they mean when they say no justice don't ... know peace and take them at their words\nAnd so now's the time to keep the mob from taking over our government they have not on the rights to be in charge in fact they have burned to the right to go to jail\n\nAnd I would like to hear from you about what you're going to do to be a part of that about keeping them from office and then there's one other part of this that I Want to discuss with you that I find it very interesting is I'm just I'm roasting myself in election news or by the way by way of introduction of radio hosted in Washington D. C. [noise]\nBelieve it or not we actually do have a lot of conservatives in the Washington area a lot of Republicans and by the way a lot of a non conservatives even liberal Democrats who listen to my program and enjoy it they listen to talk radio because we give them a chance to actually be a part of the conversation\nI wouldn't you love to pick up the phone and tell Anderson Cooper why you think he's full of crap when did you loved to pick up the phone and tell Lester Holt how he just got that story wrong can't do that\nBut I my home station in Washington WMA ah which is a station the market within appears he comes on right after me and his warm up act from\nThree to six in the afternoon and then he comes out right after me uh he uh eastern time of course are the people can call in people who disagree I Love it you know my clubs having people who disagree with him called in and take issue with something that he said that's what makes talk radio so dynamic there's nowhere else in Washington that you can get that that's why our radio station so popular\nOr as bad as I immerse myself in all of this election news immerse myself in all of the polling which I most of it I don't believe\nAnd all of the ah that jockeying for position between now as we are in the home stretch here between now and election day in twenty seven days a I Love ... pausing for a moment on some of the studies that I see some of the polls some of the\nAnalysis that I see and I like to bring a lot of it up to uh to you then have you be a part of that conversation so you can help explain why you think things are the way they are [noise]\nAre into that and I I Am fascinated by this article\nThat I see it's a great website called study finds dot org it it sort of aggregate since summarizes a lot of studies out there and then and you know generally speaking I have a rule of thumb when it comes to studies where research papers and\nA ... you know a well informed a a a high brow ... doctors getting together and performing a study and then coming out with results that they spit out to us and we're supposed to take them as a Bible truth\nOr most of the time my rule of thumb was studies is if it doesn't make common sense I tend to not believe it [laughter] if it cuts against the grain of what we see a study and I said well that can't be true that makes no sense my entire life history and every single person I Know when my life and everyone that I've ever talked to\nA informed me that that is a load of of of steaming dog do are generally speaking then uh I I go with my instincts and I and I disregard the study this one though\nI find to be fascinating and I think that it makes sense but what I'd like you to tell me is why\nWhy do you think this is true American men actually favor female politicians\nOver male politicians midterm elections are just around the corner\nAnd so it could be a potential turned the tide of American politics when it comes to gender says the skewed article from study found work a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males and survey fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researchers in Steven's Institute of technology and I won't get bogged down in a lot of the of various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find this to be a sort of the most important part\nWhen it breaks it down between a Republicans and Democrats\nOr this is fascinating\nAh Democrats\nDemocrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician mailed Democrats\nWill favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way\nRepublican men and women are fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other you know now me\nIf I'm looking at two Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same and and in terms of their their a resume their track record it it's it it I'd have to flip the coin between two Republican candidates one demand and Wonder Woman\nI'd probably go for the check I'd I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why\nI got I think it makes us look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most ... nations fighters for the conservative cause\nHave been women I'm just more impressed by them and I think they're used to take 'em to golf a little bit more than they can get back a little bit better I think men are are are are are too easily cowed by the media they do they don't want to be called names they don't want to be a a\nDon't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm not going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\nBut women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they heard it all and they don't give a damn really the life I had\nFight my way and the professional world being married for decades raising kids raising grad and when you think I'm going to be concerned about about a Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please I've given birth\n\nI don't I don't need to worry about you I've been through it all but I I tend to want to put the baby in there and I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp and I do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans against served as it doesn't they don't show a preference\nWhich truly shows but it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia but don't judge people by their chromosomal makeup we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha because I Want to show how look I Am\nI'm I'm I'm more feminine and Alan Alda just wait I'll bet you bet ya I think that this is a way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one two three months but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dude Z uh they they want to show women\nHow incredibly wonderful they are looking hardly wind state I mean you couldn't have found a better Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified that very model\nOf a male Democrat in the United states of America he gave the all the right cause as he raised money for all the right candidates\nHe was pro choice he he's never met an abortion he hasn't liked\nHe made sure that he was in the forefront of every liberal causes in America because she ... was his suit of armor that was his protection\n\nHe was able to be as as abominable and sexist and horrible and despicable as a man can be but as long as he gets to where the mantle of feminist liberal Democrat\nChecks all the boxes on the list of the causes you support and the candidates you throw money at and raise money for a while then you'd get a free pass up to a

my friends I [noise] I watch\nActually I listen to Nikki Haley's conference with the president [noise] where it was announced that she was leaving the United nations at the end of the year she had already pulled the president this [noise]\nPrior to the I don't know when to do was made clear several months ago Romney so there's speculation as to why she leaving because of course nothing could actually happen\nFor orderly among us reasons seems to me that two years of the United nations\nOr one should be up for a monument somewhere in the capital especially if you've confronted the bad guys

the risk but I think of it but what is the risk in my ... for the president of the United states has been a great president\nMm well the risk is\nThat you alienate those who hate the president but I have a model would regard Tibet\nBy adopted this when I ... in my first full time job\nAnd I was the director of a Jewish Institute in California that's why I moved from New York to California in my twenties to direct this Institute they had weekend retreats it's gorgeous facility thirty two hundred acres\nThey had this summer sessions for young people and I would advocate gobs existence from I Would advocate\nObservance of the laws in the Bible and so on and some members of the board were very afraid of my advocacy\nOf cobs existence an observance of the laws of the Bible and so on and they uh they would say to me you know not not too long with hatred or anything like that are just they would be worried and they would say you know you'll alienate some of the people who come and I developed a great phrase\nThat has guided me you can't alienate the alienated\nThey already worry Leah mated [laughter]\nSomebody you know a friend begged them to cover somebody treated the weekend or whatever\nSo you know I'll alienates people by saying that the president of the United states has been great bus far I don't think that those people have already ... because that's all it takes is is

a nation of them he won't he's too reliant on China ... China's way of holding us hostage is is North Korea there is no no no other\nSo that's the reason I worry about the fact that China has abuse the world Trade Organization that it is abused intellectual property it's I I personally a worry more about China then about Russia\nOr for a whole host of reasons I and I think the Chinese nationalism is growing at ...
