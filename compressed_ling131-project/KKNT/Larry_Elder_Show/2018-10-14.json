some good things from our contacts but from your perspective how would you say you know the Caribbean is doing these things as a rebound from twenty Seventeen hurting them\n[noise] I think what we have found and in fact I spent a good part of the very late spring traveling among some of the most damage to Ireland and from the twenty Seventeen hurricanes and it's\nHard to believe it's been more than a year but in September of course as we all know\nTwo enormous hurricanes plowed across the Caribbean and then did also significant damage to the mainland United States Irma and Maria and several of the island groups and islands of the Caribbean or ravaged\nI'm In ways that we haven't seen in the Caribbean in a very long time and so we do really important for us it cost of living to go down we wanted to cover the recovery\nWe wanted to inspire our leaders who love the beach and of course and a lot of the Caribbean to go back and spend their money and share their love and help these islands were cover ups really great to be there and see that a lot\nOf these beautiful little boutique hotels resorts beach bars are back\nAnd they're ready to eat and they can't wait for a while to come down\nBut well that's very good news Tracey I Know you were recently and one of the U.S Virgin Islands St John is the one I'm thinking that's particular can you let us know what's going on it's a

then the ... and more sort of a lot of the big resorts\nArt back yet but there are boutique hotels there are there's this dreamy cottage pair of cottages but it's actually on our copper of our brand

step on the island so it's a really rich experience it's always been a favorite St John for many many people but now it's even more kind of warm and loving and heartfelt than ever before\n... not far

eastern portion of the country\nIt does leave work very hard to bring together a hand picked group around twenty two independently owned boutique hotel um that includes the bed and breakfast so small and large property but that is um that's how we got to be discovered these folks if there are other living\nStories that we ever as we traveled a full region of the south and we invited these members are promoting hotel collection just a few years ago it's relatively new for us but growing rapidly\nBecause of hair so from what I understand it you do have sort of a wide mix of properties you've got some new properties as well as uh\nSome of the older more iconic hotels that I Would think are deeply rooted in some good old fashioned southern traditions I'm curious for our listeners who have not

moment traveling tourists can cast made is an avid burger who's written dozens of books including his own field guide series the caffeine field guide and he led many tourists to all seven continents\nHe's also a frequent keynote speaker at many perverted nature events and he's joining us now\nHello Ken I'm told your frequent listener reverse shows so thank you and welcome to our world travel\nBoth thanks so much yeah not very interested in travel and all of you guys are the experts on or if I Love your show\nWill appreciate that very much so it's we've never done a segment on this program dating back to its inception in two thousand four on burning kind of surprised me and it's the reason why we asked our producer Valerie to coordinate your parents so from your experiences and travels how big do you think the burning industry is and why does it continue the growing popularity [noise]\nWhat would have huge actually I mean there have been surveys that is trying to quantify it all the way there are more than forty five million people\nIn the United states who are bird watchers across a lot of you know do that in the back yard is all her do travel element to it and according to a part of that through the lower level in almost Fifteen billion dollars or a bird watchers during their travel well rounded lodging and transportation\nAnd I I mean that's pretty basic that kids can for people let's say and I think you know there may be the sort of a misnomer I think you need to travel to the exotic parts of the world to enjoy burning but there are three areas right here in the u._s._a. or outstanding destinations and I know that you've written about may know that you've been to a\nCentral New Mexico the central Texas ... north eastern Florida which I'm not sure how effective they worry about the hurricane that might be a little bit more challenging\nIf we can you just give us a quick factor to some free area [noise]\nI'm sure yeah that's actually relevant right now because I'm thinking about our National Wildlife refuges and National Wildlife refuge or when you\nStart tomorrow and October Fort around the park in the middle of a new record the book at the national wildlife refuge is an amazing area are wintering bird like crying and know that your favorite ... ...\nAnd less opportunities there\nThe central Texas coast around the national wildlife refuge\nBecause of that place in the world and cry and they were there there was a big clock the northern Canada migrants from central\nTo spend the winter it around and I'm a whole area that section of the\nEarth for Hurricane Harvey hit August with them and they're still rebuilding family area but if you go to the bird watching is greater than by going or whether you're out for the economy and help rebuild\nAmerican culture and [noise] some Michael Vick\nThere are a great day another great weak in fact in this greatest nation on God's green earth what a great we get is it is the first week for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nNewly installed associate justice of the Supreme Court [noise]\nBut uh his presence on the court which is I'm beginning work today\nHis presence on the court doesn't entirely please everyone in the country's pleases me a great deal I Will confess or\nThere are a number of people who are suggesting this is the end of the Republicans we know it is a beginning of a new civil war\nThere have already been announced intentions by a whole host of organizations and some leaders in Congress on the Democratic side\nThat as soon as they take control of the house of representatives so says representative Jerrold Nadler who is a very very very liberal Democrat from Manhattan\nA representative Mettler says he's going to be the new chair of the Judiciary Committee of the Democrats take over and one of his first orders of business in fact his first order of business will be a full investigation\nAnd impeachment of\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh good idea you look forward to that of course they also want to investigate President Trump or on the grounds impeachment this has been going on for a while look if you voted democratic in these upcoming elections\nYou're voting for this insanity to continue\nWhy is it good for the country what do you hope to accomplish when I'm Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday was officially confirmed by a vote in the U.S Senate of fifty to forty eight\nIt actually would have been fifty one to forty nine except senator Steve Gaines of a North Dakota\n... wanted to participate in his daughter's wedding and look as somebody who last may participated in my own daughter's wedding and our own daughter's wedding I understand how the senator felt and Senator Murkowski who voted wrong on Kavanaugh in my opinion\nI was very gracious and saying look she will keep it so that it will be shown that I'm Brett Kavanaugh actually passed with a to vote margin the final vote would have been fifty one forty nine as it was it was fifty to forty eight because she just voted present alright fine um [noise]\nThis is what it sounded like when Mike Pence announced the final vote he of course as vice president presides over the U.S Senate listen [noise]\nTo sergeant at arm's will restore order in the gallery [noise]\nStarted at arm's will order and the gallery\nStrip mansion [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order and the gallery [noise]\n\nStarted their arms will restore during the gallery [noise] sergeant at arm's\nWill restore order and the gallery [noise]\nOkay um\nWhat what is it that the folks are screaming about and what are they aiming to achieve what's fascinating to me about this is remembered that dramatic Thursday it seems like another era where you had testimony from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you hadn't testimony from Brett Kavanaugh very very high profile everyone was watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any there weren't whether Germany nobody nobody no ... and now somehow they were able for that to control these idiots\nAnd I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that are are idiots indeed\nHonestly if they can control it in a high profile situation that shooting troll it every day\nThis is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic that people should be able to come on and into the galleries and screaming shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is really prosecuting these people\nAnd I'm making them feel that disrupting Congress when doing its job and by the way\nI Would include all of the conservative demonstrators who knew that kind of thing as well why do I say that because there are not I mean this is not something conservatives do what can you think of the last time\nThat some right winger interrupted a the proceedings of a Senate committee or the Senate in session making an important decision like confirming a springboard justice of the Huffington Post\nPut together a collage of some of the truly eloquent inspiring voices that had been raised against the Kavanaugh's confirmation [noise]\n\n\n\nWe stand with Dr boring we than what the various\nBelieve this country is facing\n\n\nOkay uh throw them out\nBecause and this is going to help why I actually I Love it and I'm Glad to give it a tension and by the way let's a link to some of that that footage which is really wonderful to watch and I I Need to describe it to\nA group of demonstrators came up to the doors of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court building in the United states in Washington DC\nIt's a wonderful building and that Greek temples style all based upon the parts on an Athens and classics because again the founders of our country\nIdentified with the creators of Greek and Roman law they did I Know ... more white males though again there are people and African studies departments who claim the ancient Greeks were really not white but leave that aside um\nMeanwhile these folks came up to the doors of the Supreme Court building and the doors are those heavy metal doors that with carvings on them and big handles\nAnd so a group of demonstrators came up to the doors Supreme Court building banging on them literally budding their heads against them screaming and shouting and sounding like this\n[noise]\n\nWhat is the [noise]\nWhat is the the clear message here that we're supposed to be getting I Will tell you I think there's a clear message is overwhelming was clear\nIf you think this stuff is good for our country and then of course you want to vote democratic coming up a month from now you you do because the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know and\nUh and basically some of the Democrats on the Senate floor wait to hear Cory Booker Spartacus\nOr who really has jumped the shark I mean it's it's just if this is your hysteria\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh\nI think he's talking about ... you'd think he's talking about a a heaving analogize is the ah the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty or some salt on the individuals who are expressing their opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nI I mean what are we talking about here\nWhy is this\nAppropriate they they have of course had a song or what would be a liberal occasion unless you actually go to the one of the protest from Saturday immediately after the vote it sounded like this [noise]\nBelieve me\nThat's right [noise] some new cases today say la [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI don't\nAlready done so\nIn other words it wasn't just shift the court at all and by the way that Justice Kennedy was no liberal Justice Kennedy was a moderate on the Supreme Court he was appointed by President Reagan
