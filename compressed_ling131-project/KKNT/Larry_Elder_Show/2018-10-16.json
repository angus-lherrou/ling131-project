[noise]\nBut how many times have you heard the the the talking point 'cause that's what it is it's factually incorrect that the Reagan tax cuts man they cause massive deficits hopes that is factually not\nCorrect there were big deficits in the Reagan years that is correct they were not caused by the tax cuts the Reagan tax cuts after taxes were cut tax revenue went up dramatically it almost doubled by the time Reagan left office that's\nLook that up yourself to Google those tests tax websites that go over historical packs numbers choke even adjusted for inflation they went up dramatically\nBut it's evidence of the liberals tactical ability to constantly staying on message that's typically false\nState that fast messes repeatedly you use the media to isolate people from the truth because the media with Palestine out of and I tell people that your story and get people to believe something that's factually incorrect\nIt is factually incorrect to say that there were so that the Reagan tax cuts cause the death of his tax revenue went up we just spent more money that is not a factual said but we've been told so often people believe it will ...\nThis this whole thing about how Clinton Clinton wiped out the national daddy's zeroed out the national data we have no deficit under court than that it's just not true some people say oh there's a there was a Clinton so plus I I

money then expand none they got close at the end of his presidency but there was no stop watch ever they ran anywhere\n... put it this way the simplest way to describe this because liberals always have a tough time understanding even mechanical basic service if there was a surplus in the Clinton years answer me this right\nHow is it that every single year of the bill Clinton presidency every single year the national debt rose please explain to me and normal mathematical terms how that happened if they ran a surplus it's not always they didn't pay the debt back on the debt one up every single\nYear the Clinton presidency but no I was told on TV that was that Clinton surpass the ... you were told wrong I I don't know what to tell you you know you were probably told when you were a

now ABC nightly news NBC nightly news CNN story on how the Clinton surpluses admit they would go away forever but they won't do it\n\nThey do this now they're doing it now and the reason I bring it up is because they are good at staying on\nMessage that's how they get these myths to persist over time Trump pass them scattered all over the place they cannot stay on message you got one guy who spotted gifts you got one guy I skateboard in the parking lot better now you got one guy talking about\nFart jokes I I'm Serious Sheldon Whitehouse this is the Democrats\nI fundamentally disagree with
