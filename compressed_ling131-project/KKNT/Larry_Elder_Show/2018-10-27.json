I'm going to give you an exam Gen ... Mary is a despicable former communications director under Brock Obama she is a radical extreme [noise]\nAnd she's on MSNBC today and here's what she says cut nine go\nIt was either President Bush for President Obama who had been leading as some have called um Hillary Clinton and brought her mama\nAnd the other uh I reached out to San Antonio express concern of for their safety and saying whether they're one of those by that and think about this today and that it had been clear that assess taxes motivated by political granting from the president did I\nSee that motivated by political renting from this president as is pretty clear\nAbsolutely sick and the shooter you see at the baseball field but actually almost killed Steve ... and actually shot other people\nShe would never say he was motivated by the political read things that Bernie Sanders\nAbout such an unjust society has the Republicans are blocking health care for all and on and on she would never say that\nBecause she is diabolical go ahead\nAnd saw on that and that and he saw an end socks you saw a lot of right wing propaganda on that has that drowning\nPropaganda if you think CNN sucks right wing ... you see what they give you they just keep at it day in and day out go ahead\nAnd come back on the president to say something you know sign but also some nice says\nSomething unifying and he was immediately mocked by your ilk\nYou having given this guy a break since the day he announced his presidency to run for president\nYou having given them a break at all given mocking I'm trying to humiliate him trying to smear him going after his taxes going after his wives ex wives his wife going after his kids don't after his businesses digging up whatever the hell you can you never treated Obama this way\nAnd you won't treat any Democrat this way go ahead\nDecide about the political uh of of of this has to say that we got to tone it down we got to come together and here she is\nA bleeding heart left wing hack stealing burping up her poison talking about we have to tone it down\n\nIt's just incredible now I'm not going to keep playing that because it's like waterboarding I'm not going to do that to your dinner time but now here's Dana Bash she supposed to be a reporter right\nOn CNN Today cut ten go\nThere's teleprompter Trump and there's Twitter Trump and that was teleprompter Trump\nOr something that was written very carefully very well by\nThe way there's teleprompter Dana Bash Anders non teleprompter Dana Bash go ahead\nAnd you know presented lay him to doing what he should do I think that as president talking about the black that violence is is never okay [noise] um\nThe problem is what he didn't say either oh in that teleprompter space yeah or unfair which is\nWe all need to lower the rhetoric 'cuse me he said that but what you didn't like is he also told you to lower\n\n... go ahead\nBecause I as president of the big impact on people and what I say and they have an impact us as everybody else has\nBernie Sanders has an impact\nJust as the uh the nut job in Utah who sent the rice and packages and others when Democrats speak they have an impact on the media speak they have an impact\n\nNothing that Donald Trump said resulted in a rice and being sent to a Susan Collins or General Mattis was ahead of our navy but his kid sort of Trump himself right\nWho's responsible for that Maxine Waters who seriously Chuck Schumer\nAdam Schiff who's responsible for that\nDana Bash go ahead\nFully man with a loud megaphone and the most Twitter followers and politics and that was a big omission\nNow this was a reporter ladies and gentleman who is giving her opinion endlessly and that's part of the problem in this country\nThere are people who give opinions people like me like Sean like rush like Carlson like getting ready to go down to less and there are people who are supposed to be straight news people not interpreting the news like giving their opinion on the news not question just given those does that sound like Dana Bash\nShe sounds like Jen how Mary I'm mouthpiece for Iraq no house Benita Obama\nDiet\nHave not seen him feeling that blank and ... anything as you mentioned he's on the other way\n... go ahead go ahead\nAnd continue to do animosity towards media\nNot stoking animosity towards the media keep using the phrase all over you bobble heads to your\nStoking animosity towards the media because you're dishonest you're intellectually dishonest\nOh you're a liberal Dana Bash you know John Harris your former husband you know he's a liberal you know Don Lemon as radical cool do you know what you know Jeff Zucker is a liberal who hates Trump you on that phony network know who you are you know what you're doing\nAnd then you have these comments to make wow this animosity toward us of course he has animosity toward you as do millions of people and we think for ourselves it's not like the president's taxes fingers and all of a sudden

and you see it's about the brown people\n\nJoe Scarborough the White House man on TV next to Chris Matthews\nIt's about the brown people really when Shelby Steele was one of my uh Fox show several months ago life liberty and live and he pointed out the guise of talk this way\nThey feel like they immunize themselves from criticism that they're better than all of you and so they can position themselves you see is supporting brown people\nBy you folks out there who aren't brown you obviously have brown people because you don't agree with Joe\nThis is a sick mindset and they want to talk about put it in the fuel and the fire when they constantly push this racist narrative constantly\nThey're not upset with their own rhetoric I get a caller from Aleppo complaining about antifa it as a violent left wing militia group a Marxist militia group\nAnd we in individuals on CNN like Don Lemon people on MSNBC who downplayed the violence they trust\nI mean they come armed\n\nExcuses are made for them But Trump's rhetoric you see is what's pushing that country over the edge\n\nOne of the biggest almost in human history is Adolf Hitler they call they call American citizens who voted for him Nazis racists\nBut at the Trump you see\nIf the left and the Democrats and the media had accepted the results of this last election twenty sixteen\nCriticized the president of course but try to destroy him come up with the Russian conspiracy theories act like they're the national Enquirer with every allegation\nTry and force him from office talk about his mental illness and on and on and on\nIf they accepted his legitimacy as president and criticized his policies or what he would say that's one thing but that's not what's going on in this country that's not what's going on in this country and we all know it doesn't\nCall your little whiny asked me if I asked my Trump said that he had no idea who asked Lopez Rivera was\nNothing and you don't give a damn you didn't care about bill airs you didn't care about pretty darn college another one you don't care about any up\n\nIncredible really incredible really and what exactly has Trump said\nThat would cause somebody to try and blow up twelve other people or threatened while other people\nWhat does he said he said punch somebody in the ... oh so when Obama said get in the face when holder said get them when they're down and I go on and on and on that sparked some Republican\nNo\nOne Bernie Sanders goes on and on about\nHow horrible America how about how it just it is how people are discriminated against outrage says we

are covering this race correctly FBI undercover agent paid suit tab\nFor Andrew Gillum fundraiser documents ... let me tell you a Florida particularly you independence haven't voted yet or thinking about it you can have a guy here who is under investigation for his entire governorship if you elect to measure governor because this guy was taken freebies left and right\nYou know about the Costa Rica trip you know about the Hamilton ticket you know about the hotel in New York City these things are worth thousands of dollars\nBut here's the breaking story tonight by the Tallahassee Democrat and undercover FBI agent\nPosing as an Atlanta developer\nSeeking to do business with the city of Tallahassee where he was mayor Gillum\nPicked up the catering bill Frey twenty sixteen fundraiser for mayor Andrew Gillum nascent political action committee forward Florida\nThe pack would eventually become the war chest of dealings gubernatorial campaign it is the first piece of evidence linking the ongoing FBI pro Gillum broader campaign for statewide office\nAnd that stuff's trickling out trickling out not due to the scientists campaign or the Republicans but due to one of the people whose caught up in this lobbyist\n\nThe emails and receipts released her friday today as part of a supplemental records requests from the Florida commission on ethics\nShows that the agent the undercover FBI agent Mike Miller was invoice four thousand three hundred and eighty six dollars by one oh one restaurant and meant lounge a restaurant owned by lobbyists Adam Corey at the time to this guy Korea's buddies\nOr was what Gillum\nAnd email exchange shows that Miller paid the bill and Gillum send them a personal thank you how does a thank you note uh for the food now Galen has been a line through his teeth all along about the extent of this investigation and he knows the extent of the ... investigation\nSort of lying about the extent of the FBI investigation he's been lying about his involvement and corruption in the city\nOf Tallahassee and it is corrupt and today again is trashing police officers police officers that are forced to to to draw a weapon even a taser well then they've blown it according to him\nA month after meeting Mike Miller this is the FBI undercover agent for breakfast that the power plant cafe or at the Edison\nCorey that's the lobbyists and lifted the undercover agent to help foot the bill for a fundraising dinner a courthouse on behalf of gums gubernatorial campaign I'll keep in mind or Cory the lobbyist and buddy of a Gillum didn't know that this guy Miller was undercover agent of course\n[noise] and email exchange between Corey and lo and\nBryce Barnes a Florida Democratic Party official who go on to become finance director for building a ... campaign show them arranging a dinner fundraiser at Coors house for forward a Florida Gillum gubernatorial pack\nPack was originally set up as they generally so now you have a his gubernatorial pack\nDoing a fundraiser and the male is paid for by the undercover agent the undercover FBI agent not clearly that's illegal the fire build\nThe event is honoring Gillum and in one email Barnes describe it as the first kick up a vent for his campaign so tender by roughly forty Tallahassee notable Z\nIncluding this one in that one with a past way with the outstanding to get to thirty seven thousand eight hundred and fifty whatever we can push to get us over that forty thousand dollar mark would be amazing Barnes wrote to Corey thank you again for all your work to make it successful event last night\nThe minimum donation for the dinner was five thousand dollars a person\nFor you once again based on fact for the\nEverybody Martin living here are number have seven seven three one three won and won the seven seven three have one ... one one way with special guest at the bottom of the hour as\nWe have this entire week and we will next week as we try to address some of the important races where I feel we need to hold the hold our ground [noise] Brock Obama was in Wisconsin today\nAnd he said something very very important and I want you to listen to this as we'll discuss it cuts sixteen go\nUp and he's trying to make it hard for stitches since devote\nA lot of the hate and poison and division\nI as a result of bronco bomb and propaganda like that eight years of that eight years of or not a years But Eric holder\nAnd you hear other people from his administration Hillary Clinton\nThey've created these these wedge issues they've done a hell of a job but turn in this country inside out and upside down fundamental transformation\n\nBut what he's saying actually was stolen from Franklin Roosevelt in a famous speech that he gave that I made famous I guess from the Nineteen twenties\nHe said we have these respite some paraphrasing\nWe progress as we advance advance but we don't hold office long enough to do the things we have to do and so they figured out what they need to do is create this permanent bureaucracy and take over the courts which is something Woodrow Wilson push for\n\nOur founding fathers are used\nIn very diabolical ways by leftist like Brock Obama on the one hand they condemn them\nSaying they owned slaves some did some did\n\nOn the other hand they use the declaration of independence and less so but sometimes the constitution to claim that what they're advancing\nIs what the founders and the frame or is actually intended and so if you really don't train your mind to understand that soon followed this it can be alluring or it can be confounding but it can also be Lauren\n\nWe've progressed as take two steps forward in these conservatives plus Pakistan\n\nAnd progressive ism is the way forward just say and progressive ism is what really the framers of the constitution intended and the declaration of independence nothing could be further from the truth he knows it but he lies\n\nOn alien about rights has nothing to do a government that has to do with the civil society\n\nThere was no federal government there was no national government when the declaration of independence was adopted\n\nUnalienable rights natural rights aggressive isn't rejects all this he knows that he's ...\nHe knows where Woodrow Wilson stood and Franklin Roosevelt study knows all about John ...\n\nAnd Henry crawling all arrested I've written about at some length\n\nHe knows mark swelling angles as well and go well [noise] and he knows that in order to create this utopia which is really hell on earth you have to destroy these institutions\n\nYou have to destroy the institutions unalienable rights has nothing to do with the progressive agenda\nPro union anti union minimum wage no minimum wage health care no health has nothing to do with that\n\nIt is a recognition that we are human beings that we're individuals and we have the right to be free\n\nAnd we're supposed to be treated equally under the law\n\nNothing to do with economic outcomes are minimum wage or the laundry list of ah of the left wing agenda\nAnd Obama in this just so you understand modern history Obama and this is a regurgitate in things that have been said by Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd his new nationalism speech Woodrow Wilson and multiple speeches that he gave\nAnd all of them attacked the declaration of independence or turn it inside out as Obama dead what he's doing here isn't particularly smart he just stealing the propaganda the past hundred years old more they wrap themselves in the declaration of independence\nBy rewriting it by rewriting\nI don't have enough time to get into this again if you read or rediscovering Americanism and the tyranny of progressive ism you'll know exactly what's going on here as I said when I wrote it over a year old I'm not hawking and I'm just saying if you want to understand that the tribes there\nHe wasn't done cut Seventeen go\nThat means first of all let's use English to keep what they got you mean to keep what they have the powerful and the privileged fight hard to keep what they they got\nWhat does that mean\nThe powerful\nCorporate executives or senators and congressmen professors couldn't doctrine ate their students\nMedia personalities who who the powerful exactly\nGeorge Soros style or they want to get what they got\nWhat does that mean they want to keep what they got\nYou learn something legitimately by your smarts by your hard work whatever of course you want to be what you got why shouldn't you the most powerful people in this country or the people who run government\nBecause they have something that you do not have in the private sector you know what that is Mr producer\nThe law the law they control the law\nThey can punish people they can find people that can penalize people they can put people in prison\n\nThat's why the communist socialist the fascists they want to control the government they don't want to control this company or that company or this building that building they want the government they want to control the government you weren't constitution which he claims to support and does not\nControl the individual doesn't control

we\nHave every reason to celebrate as a country and President Trump has been speaking recently about the need to come together and to see things and harmony and to see things as Americans not as Republicans or Democrats or pro Trump or is there an anti Trump per se but basically to look at this\nThing citizens and when you look at this thing uh this has been remarkable and one of the things that I literally just moments before I got on the air here I put out a tweet that said look this should remind everybody of how lucky\nWe are to have people in place like yes Jeff Sessions and you ask Christopher Wray the head of the FBI and yes all of those extraordinary people who work every single day sometimes putting their lives on the line\nTo keep us safe through the FBI and the rest of the law enforcement\nThrough the New York city police to the local Florida police we just had a um a moment with Jeff Sessions are announcing the arrest if you haven't heard it and you probably have but Caesar say all coups fifty six years old\nWho um at least as far as I can gather has no known employment\nAppears to have been living in his van and yes his van is festooned with all kinds of a political a bumper stickers and posters it's actually kind of artfully designed but the messages on the van are insane and a despicable\nAnd dare I say it deplorable\nIn any event he was a arrested today taken into custody he's having multiple charges filed against him\nHe was being interrogated in what they call a national security exemption in other words they can't interrogate him without an attorney present dinner fear I think that what they're trying to do is to determine\nWhether or not he had any accomplices or had any associates in a doesn't appear to a a guy with a very very long criminal history\nA guy who as I mentioned may or may not have been living in his van recently uh before that during another very serious criminal charges in during another bankruptcy that he declared he was living with his mom\nAnd I'm at ... we're not talking about a an ... an upstanding or model citizen and when you look at pictures of the van I you know I think about this because\nMy most important role in the world is that right and that is true for probably many many of the males who were listening to me\nAnd I was looking at the pictures of the van with all the messages on it and literally you can't see out the windows because the windows are totally covered with top youth soccer recruits for Trump drain the swamp dishonest media CNN sucks I'm hard rock weekly\nOr they have a seminal hard rock weekly now this has led to some confusion\nI think because people are saying well he may or may not be Native American I think the seminal there is not a reference to the tribe it's a reference\nTo the football team or to the um [noise] uh Florida State Seminoles I Believe it is in any other also pictures of Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton\nAnd I believe in the Van Jones a with a targets on their faces and that's not good but in any event I ... what I was trying to imagine\nIs think if you have a daughter\nAnd somebody's coming up to pick up your daughter in front of the

[noise] I Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg\nIt's you or who has suggested a that any any time that police spot a van or a car\nOr any kind of people with more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately in any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off to where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and and by the way I Hope that this leads to President Trump and all the rest of us\nAppreciating the attorney general a little bit more appropriately here's the attorney general of the United states\nAnd blue to participate in this amount that I suspect is in the city or the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith fire federal crimes including interstate transportation an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former president some certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges the defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges made a change or expand as the investigation pursued\nThis is the law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\nOkay good for him a he's he's exactly right and you know what the president spoke beautifully this morning no I mean it uh the Twitter feed probably best ignored but uh his speaking this morning was solid\nHe uh he was speaking to a great group and there were so enthusiastic and he was bonding with him so well it was a moving occasion\nHe was speaking to turning point USA's young black leadership summit and it's it's ironic I just this morning I left um Minneapolis I left the hotel this morning at five\nAnd five AM and I wrote to the airport with my friend and colleague Larry Elder who was on his way to precisely this young black leadership summit\nAnd uh it here's what the president sounded like with the announcement before he began what was a very successful and a fine speech to the people who are attending that somebody who is president the United states\nI like to begin as you are leaders that's a real leaders\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country band a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect had taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigations find that person or persons responsible for these\nEvents terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI was struck the authorities to spare no resource are expensive and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [noise]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it made me not\nExtent of the law\nOkay a good for you Mr President and then he went on to say this\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America cannot flooded out I don't\nRead I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nI've just concluded a briefing with the department of justice is following the apprehension of the suspects\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service department of justice the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York [noise] the NYPD federal law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people to work so hard\nAnd to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible\nIncredible job but I Want to congratulate [noise] okay that's the president of\nThe United states and this is a fine moment for President Trump and I know he didn't ah the debt so said the DNA on the saliva on the stamps from the packages\nTo understand for people on the left who have been trying to see the acts of this uh evil Mad Men and he is both evil and he clearly as a madman he's also a total loser will go over his arrest\nRecord coming up it's bad that takes almost a segment on its own because he has an extensive prolific arrest record including a prior arrests record for threatening to blow people up with bombs are there are real questions about why he was running around out among us and I'm ... the plant over here\nIs I Would just [noise]\nTry to get folks on on the left including I ...
