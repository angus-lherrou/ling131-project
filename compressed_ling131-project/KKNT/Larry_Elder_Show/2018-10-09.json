know you have this tendency to kind of you know want to understand how liberal see the world I mean again I was never a liberal I'm I but I was an independent most of my life but what really opened me up to conservatism was this scene us moment\n\nAnd then they started out some moment for me was when I was a police officer in New York City\nAnd I saw how again I'm not suggesting every single time a ... you know there are a listener unfortunately are bad cop cigarettes I'm telling you the overwhelming majority overwhelming I worked with were great guys and women who really just\nGave a damn they weren't there to get rich trust me there ain't no money in policing and he is a word in that case\n\nBut when I was a cop and I was an independent and you know again sometimes sometimes that even kind of see it the liberal way for being surrounded all the time by Democrats\n\nI remember how some cops in use of force incidents who\nI Know did nothing wrong they acted according to how they were almost viciously it immediately attacked by the media activists after without even giving them a fair shake I'm telling you that was my that in a moment\nWhy said something's wrong here this is this isn't right I mean if you can just attack someone a\nPolice officer without even hearing your story in an unquestionably tragic incident now or use of force incidents are no one goes out in the street with the desire to get to use of force into that sorry do you think that's what cops do your seriously seek professional help\n\nBut to see the way they were treated that was my they're saying a moment I'm telling you Democrats I'm telling you that they're saying us moment is happening almost daily now with you guys and ladies\nScreaming and raving lunatics attacking people I have montage as I put together on my show of liberals losing their minds\nYou know who the who exactly do you think this appeals to you are turning off generations of Americans just like you did back in the Nineteen sixty eight election is Dan Horowitz again puts in his wonderful piece in conservative review today\nI Know Nixon fan believe me Nixon was a Nixon was more of a Democrat that he was a Republican and he was an awful president I'm Sorry but the Nixon campaign team understood that late Nineteen sixties election that\nThe last rule we learn from this chaos doesn't sell chaos creates a bunch of ... moments and that ain't us moments our parents and kids sit on their couches and look at the chaos on the TV and say to their kids\nHate us we don't do that Johnny we don't attack people's\nCars like you saw in Oregon today by and people we don't do that chaos doesn't sell the Democrats are destroying whatever brand they have left because they are marrying themselves to chaos\nChaos doesn't sell

two hours of the show recovered the most important topic of the day\nThe lessons learned from Cabot off we have to continue to when\nThere is no appeasing the lab to forget it it's all were they are not giving you any morality points any brownie points\nAny poker chips and isn't happening the left is not interested\nIt's not it's like fetch right wasn't it mean girls say last week or something [noise] member to fetch fetch is not going to happen this is not going to happen it doesn't matter how many times you kiss the bus to the media types you vote with the left if you're a Republican the minute they need you and your band members vote conservative it's over for you\nWe need to move on when he marshalling forces and we need to realize that the left is that a historic moment of week this year\nHistoric they have not saying I think they don't have the White House they don't have the house of representatives they don't have the Senate they don't have the Supreme Court they still have some leans in some circuits or would a leaning liberal the night of course where they're heavily liberal\nThey still got some governorships obviously they still have control of some of the bigger states California and New York but the historic ab in liberal power\nIs due to you getting out their voting being active instead of heart and fighting for what you believe in in that absolutely has to continue there is no moment for rest you know we must own lives every day the new rules are we win and they Lewis and those new rules are implemented daily in their lives they should be\nThis is a serious fight\nAgainst serious people who are not kidding around\nYou seen how they respond to this kind of stuff the history of this weekend was insane calling at the Supreme Court during that actually happened\n\n[noise] I don't want to move on to some different now as I said in the last hour I\nAm a new book out I've been covering the Spygate debacle for a long time but there were some major breaks in the case this weekend as well I don't know if you miss them but Maria ... is a pretty cool shoe a show on Fox or along with mark show there is a\nTen pm eastern on Sunday life liberty and live and he had a good one this week show culture and I'm Molly Hemingway very good if you haven't seen it you have it on TV and make sure you check it out\nBut Maria barter almost show on the weekends um she has to have a new nest in quite a bit and noon is on the weekend typically drops like a tier one level nuclear bomb on every one person who he I'm not even get the information that comes out of the show is just amazing especially if you've\nBeen following this case this debacle this whole Spygate Russia gate nonsense\nThat they tried to pull on that Donald Trump team trying to pay the collusion fake fairy tale on him and spying on them as a result and this weekend knew that she was talking with Maria bought aroma and he came out and drop this little nugget\nHe said that in a closed door session a lawyer\nWorking with the DNC was apparently feeding information to the top levels of the FBI\nDisinformation according to what happened was this according to what they say happen to people who were in the room was disclosed by James Baker who was a senior level legal counsel guy and the FBI he was not a field office Scott this is a headquarters level\nHigh level guy knew that struck just bomb this weekend that before the fight was even launched\nThis guy Sassaman\nWorking with a Democrat legal law firms weren't doing work for the DNC and Hillary was shuffling information to this guy according to bakers testimony\nBooks this may seem like a little thing but the one of the states is not this is the whole essence of this debacle summed up in one ridiculous shorted a quote their weight by noon is about them\nThis guy\nLet me just explain because I get excited talking about this sometimes because it's such a disaster and I think\nHaving been a federal agent and I don't mean this hyperbolic ally or anything like that I haven't been a federal agent and again having arrested people I'm watching what happens in\nEven with bad guys if you have announced his soul in you sometimes you even though they've done some bad stuff when you you know you watch what happens is the arrest them and you see that you know the kid comes out of the room and you're like and I just have this sensitivity the abuse of government power having had it at one point\nAnd watching what happened then all of the flashing red lights that were blown through\nBy the Democrats and the Obama administration's spy on the Trump team disturbs me think about what we're saying here new that came out and bought a Romo show this weekend and said that a political for a law firm hired by a political campaign was feeding information not to a field office not too low level FBI guy\nTo a senior level attorney and the Federal Bureau of investigation plenty explicit purpose of spying on a presidential candidate folks but Spygate disaster is really three sub scandals\nRight if the information superhighway I'll get to that\nIt's this spying scandal look coordinated effort to actually use intelligence assets to spy on a political\nCampaign and it's the set up\nThere actually three sub scandals in this entire debacle this collusion fabrication\n\nThe part I'm referencing now a new NASA Maria barter almost show is the information superhighway\nThat's what I call it the information superhighway was an effort\nBy Democrat Party operatives\nThey're paid contractors whether they be law firms are opposition researchers was an effort by them to shuttle negative information about Trump and his team\nInformation most of it that turned out later on to be completely false it was the effort to get that information into the bloodstream of the department of justice and the FBI\nThrough ivy while bypassing\nThem out they weren't going to feed it to him because then it would have to go through the GI track and if it was poisoned the stomach as ways of dealing with that they wanted this main line right into the bloodstream\n\nThey needed to bypass all of those body protections that the D. O. J. and the FBI half\nThe vetting of information the woods procedure where they had information through multiple channels the vetting of sources the ah you know credibility ... listen you're telling us to stop but this is a political opponent of yours like you this is political ... research right they want it to bypass all of that the information superhighway was a way to do this\nThe way to do was to go right to the top of the FBI and not to the field office guys the guys actually during the hard work investigating the kidnappings across state lines\nThat bank robberies the terrorism cases they didn't bring their information to them they brought their information to the top level guys that suits you they knew what politicians before they were cops\nAnd they bypassed all of those legal protections\nThey did it to the FBI to what noon yes revealed this weekend by shuttling this ... lawyer right into the top levels of the FBI\n\nHow did they do it in the D. O. J. the information superhighway it was obvious in the D. OJ\nThey mainline their right to Bruce or what's the number four official in the D. O. J. was\nActually meeting with Christopher Steele who was paid to do this what what has revealed this weekend was a pivotal key piece of information but what makes this even more devastating\nIt more profile because I get it I totally understand where the lives are going to go with this so water guy had information up people pass information author no no no that's not the way that works\nThey'll typically pass it to a field office that will investigate the vet the information to go into a court of law there'll be a grand jury at some point there will be some adversarial hearing either at some initial appearance later on or a trial\nRules were verifying information the procedure\nThey craft all over due process they make no effort to handle this thing by the book so now do you see as being a former fed myself why this case really\nKnow what to say something to that upsets the hell out of me [noise]\n\nBecause I actually did this kind of stuff not not spying on President\nBut it's really really irritating\nThat the consequences that ... that was it was so enormous and treasury check cage we ... and cross the teeth you guys didn't do a spot on the president United States it's just\nWhat point do we live on this is crazy\nI let me take a call a seven seven three one through the woman if you want to join the show Tom in Cape Coral Florida area I Know very very well how are
