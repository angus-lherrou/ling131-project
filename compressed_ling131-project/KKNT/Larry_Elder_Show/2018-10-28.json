planet oasis Ohio about two billion dollars and the parks president says it's located in Ohio because it's the quote unquote center of the universe\nNow listen I was born in Cleveland didn't spend a lot on there but I graduated from Ohio University but even I Would be hard to argue the Columbus Columbus it's the center of Ohio I'll give you that\nBut I'm not sure Ohio is the center of the world

S. list that's huge could this be why\nIt's absolutely why we have made asserted African\nSo much in that sense in our downtown core fly riverfront twenty blocks or the other two are over the rise area really create for surviving the senses of restaurants and they would like to call them are that are popping up\nAll over it creates an experience that you know when you come in\nFields like a major metropolitan city don't feel like you're in the middle are chef so when you're ward every single day so we just had life in your house in New York about a month ago and it was one of the only I filled out all year\nSo far in the house\nAnd it's certainly to find and feeling really electricity and\nA lot going on there sure so we'll switch gears just a bit for the business travelers are already in Cincinnati and Delta Airlines you know there's certainly synonymous will link cities also draw for some of the top design shops in the country you're also home to major corporations like Proctor and gamble Macy's kroger's and you have the pro sports teams like the random the Bengals\nOne time and I'm Mary Carey and radio networks [noise]\n\nThat eight hundred three eight seven eight to five one eight hundred three eight seven zero to buy online moral travel by bus I ran that are and morals right now to America's number one radio show\nThem aboard you're listening to our two of the nation south probably travel show\nTravel radio show excuse me Robert Mary Karen are glad to have your joining us today it's just after eleven am eastern time on Saturday and the final weekend of October so Robert\nVery I Know we've got an email segment coming up this hour but here's something not to do the next time many of us travel Anna night as a man of the name of the manager at the Delano a Delano South Beach hotel in Miami\nShe landed Miami grabbed her bag from luggage carousel was shocked to open later to find it filled with airline equipment my work boots and safety best empower strips\nSo she went right on Twitter and advise the world that never fly American Airlines with the contents of her luggage had been replaced by airline paraphernalia and all American did when she called the complained about it was asking to fill out a form\nWell turns out ... night and grab the wrong suitcase she'd taken the one filled with their mind barely but it was in her ... American ... tweets oh it's good news we can all fly American again\nClearly nothing like John took it out it was a really good example of getting on social media in my opinion way too fast because her tweets were really strong dice fly the airline here's why and a thousand dollars worth of season airs are gone well if I had a thousand dollars for a season airs they'd be in my carry on the high tech by the way\nI Would say that's a lot from the Delano great hotel down there on South Beach tall white folks to run their furniture drapes walls everything but I ... that they are real happy to have her name associated with it is a shame multiple nasty tweets yeah things like that so far away from the point\nWhere about ... we're only actually since it's never too early halfway through today's trauma get together and said how Halloween is on Wednesday as we begin this hour with a broadcast we have a guest who's going to help us determine what is the popular candy across the country so that should be ... billion dollar industry so\nUh we'll check that out awesome airlifted the rundown we're going to get ready to\nIraq coming up and just a few minutes for a personal connection segment today Chris why that will be here to share a little bit about his position is chief information officer at the same region scare valley and how he managed to climb mount Kilimanjaro\nDespite losing to use it his legs for Muskie accident in college Scott McCartney of the wall Street Journal checks for segment three to share his experiences of boards to abort the world's longest flight on Singapore Airlines and we talked about I'm just about two weeks ago will answer some emails later this hour and then we will get to deals at the week as well you know we wrap\nOkay we'll do that so they're just said Wednesday is Halloween and candy sales right now they're happening everywhere as we speak if you've ever traveled around the country you're probably enjoy something sweet that's special to that particular area of the nation\nTom Johnson is with candy store dot com so clearly has a great job a and he's joining us right now to share the popular candy for Halloween around with us Tom I Am I right but you have a great job I'm guessing you either have a ton of friends who get the candy with you or maybe no friends as they're all envious\n[laughter] uh you know you're right and then just a job you know ruptured ... John Candy or across the country so\nIt's a blast to come into work everyday or and it it just you know you it was a blast of sugar air so it's kinda cool\nRight so time since we only had a few mass media today let's say sort of divide the country and the section since we actually started all over the U.S why don't we start with what's America's favorite Halloween candy on the west coast and maybe a few from the south west and the mountain states\nOkay um so in the west coast it there's not really sort of a west coast consensus it's um it's it's a little bit divided state by state skilled at the big one in California\nUm and that's because it's the most populous state out there on your head north to Oregon and you've got beaches cubs to Washington the solar Cassie um candy corn and do well in Idaho in Nevada and that's kind of a trend that's been a little bit controversial cross country\nOr even in New Mexico there's um candy corn is the number one can\nSelf interest me um why why they're not controversial to say\nOh you wouldn't believe people either really love her a candy corn ... um we did we did a lot of the list to did a survey of another forty thousand people on what what how he can do they don't like each\nAnd candy corn was number two on that list of the candidate they don't like so it's a ... thing and um for example Michigan\nOh this is the third year in a row and snap in Michigan for all three years that the top ... canyon and candy corn and we get so much pushback from from reporters there from our customers are we getting emails and tweets and\nI'm may well who are who are really not happy\nRudy I Know where you know ... what's the big thing really where you are in Minnesota apparently\nTootsie Rolls a poll very well here but what else is popular for Halloween I mean for for people who are traveling on the upper or lower Midwest I live in Minnesota by the way to\nGo yeah so I'm In Minnesota in butter finger in star burst and hot tamales or the top three\nHundred Mali are allowed to like it was a state to ... spicy so surprised [laughter] you know\nLaw you know when it's going to a newly come up in the rankings a game show um we sort of associated with a with a younger demographic um I don't have the data to back that up um but just anecdotally it seems like people from sort of the older generations can understand why people would like\nTo Mali can solve that kids and the people from the younger generation I'm just love it\nUp so I can see that I Know Texas is big with races All right so Mary and I are based on the New York area so um what do you figure the eastern seaboard a you know to give us one or two areas from northeastern southeast that really stuck out too\nWell what sticks out in the northeast itself patch kid there was another one candy in New York, Maine and less she said\nYeah our youngest son likes them out I Would say um I get I don't really understand about the southeast are what are you seeing there\nThe southeast skill does really well so the two are the number two in Florida last year you know the one in Florida and that's a big say in another one in South Carolina a and just generally in the south you see more sort of sugary sweet candy and less chocolate ...\nI'm going to just literally no we we we have about six or seven stations in Alaska and Hawaii were not forgetting about them I don't ... big in Alaska and is also in Hawaii but I'm going to ask you real quick before we let you go\nIn about thirty seconds can you tell me right now do you have a favorite candy Tom that you

Fifteen days to go before a very exciting [laughter] very very close congressional election coming up and gubernatorial election I mean this is a big big deal and right now\nIt turns out that right before this particular election of President Trump's approval rating according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News poll as being heavily covered on CNN\nAnd everywhere in mainstream media President Trump's approval rating is the highest it's ever been\nOkay don't get too excited if forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually close the gap between disapproval on approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd more of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh and uh then on Thursday I'll be home dotted willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's race in Senate races and more\nBut right now it's all so tight your vote really really matters [noise]\nOne of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when I had to change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and um\n[noise] in the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair\nAnd uh\nThey showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd ask them why and he had no idea he couldn't answer it and\nAnswer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nThey um can most Americans like the economic situation where in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job\nOr meanwhile with an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there is a new book that suggested it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening and\nThere is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana we did um [noise] a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a um a guy who said look I'm just a normal I'm middle aged a stay at home dad\nGo almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction and this individual by the way is for legalize marijuana is going to be joining us on the show to tell his story and to answer your questions and to take your comments\nAll coming up on the Michael ... a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise]\nHonestly part of it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should simply open the gate\nAnd and lead in all the people from the caravan\nThe even those of us who support him immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants and I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that you get seven thousand people together and they are marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let them in because they're having a tough time in Honduras there are a lot of suffering people right\nBut the notion that that uh that that just somehow one of the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea that President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea you don't simply a let people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications [noise]\nAn eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] meanwhile somebody who seemed to have a position on everything but I don't really think you have a position on the caravan because how could he [noise] he is a battle or work\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he is he is now inspired people\nThis the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy he once called lie in bed and people say oh to Trump's such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together it happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George to a age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty\nAttacked him pretty partially he said that that Reagan was practicing voodoo economics and then later we embrace that Bhutto economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president\nAnd uh they honored and came to like each other\nOr this is all remarkable what is going on that the election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song\nOver the great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as NATO the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies like this\nUp as you put them God\nGuy is totally [noise]\nNo matter\nOn may do burn by turning Texans loser\n\nNow and now\n[noise] I mean\nMen oh you bet\nTell them that little little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs a in a campaign was President Trump\nYou remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one get on the Trump train 'em in any event is Beto O'Rourke and the the axe to see about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people\nAbout NATO or work\nWhat what it is that the ... the soul and and makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator\nAnd he's a conscientious and substantive conservative\nAnd by the way knows so much more about the issues than Beto O'Rourke what is it the better our work is going to do for the country\nThat inspires reactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just a candidate he's a rock star listen I'm\nObvious strategies that I've seen a more than a in a modern day we just want to show off everywhere all the time for everyone you can without an interruption in from all that much I Love your thinking well you know [noise] [noise]\n[noise] okay um [noise] or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number a President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about uh the Democrats offering mom's not jobs or we will get to that\nAnd uh we will get to what the election comes down to there is also a a a very alarming peace in the New York times at least it's meant to be alarming I didn't think it sounded so bad\nYeah largely so what I think that's happening as he watches Cory Booker a fall out of the race rather quickly and and I and my view was Warren\nI'm effectively disqualified herself last week probably turn to the public relations although I think he's going to run for president he's going to lose the race and the Senate and he will be running for president and will probably be a pretty strong a candidate given his I don't agree with the views but\nI think he could be very charismatic he could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a ... performing and it is a performance as sort of a performance art as they say when he was doing a town hall in or near El Paso which is where he's from\nAnd you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she stashed in very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that you\nKnow he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he ruled out pretty well running in\nTwo thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um\n[noise] and some and then it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race was he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he has said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the smaller investigation has wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish but needs to finish but better or doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of those people on the far right the Denver just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future\nPresidential run or anything of the kinds hey I appreciate your call\nUm I I'm a I Will get\nBack to this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything what we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of the middle east to sort of flummoxed some of his age uh there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that soon and very soon\nA and he says it's people are going to a lot of it's going to be a big middle tax a\nFlat tax cuts middle class tax cuts and a and and then there's this whole matter of a transgendered support by government [noise] is this a political ploy ... substantive we'll get to that and more with your calls coming up on the man that show\nMy pillow
