Internal Revenue service the times found little resistance from the Internal Revenue\nAnother words do you think for two seconds if the IRS thought that any of this was illegal\nThat they wouldn't be resisting it\nThe president's parents Fred and married Trump transferred well over a billion dollars in a while to their children which could have produced they tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million under the fifty five percent tax rate than imposed on gifted in Iran says\nNow that is absurd you have all kinds of deductions over a period of time you have what's called adjusted gross income she don't just apply the fifty five percent tax\nRate\nBut the Trump paid a total of fifty two point two million about five percent tax records show\n\nPresident declined repeated requests over several weeks to comment for this article but a lawyer for Mr Trump Charles Harder provided a written statement on Monday one day after the time send a detailed description of its findings\nThe New York times allegations of fraud and tax evasion or one hundred percent false in a highly defamatory Mitt starter said there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times spaces it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate so somebody\nSomebody it looks like\nNot reading further because I don't care too committed a crime or some entities are individuals' group of them committed a crime by releasing somebody's confidential tax and ... you know this really is kind of style and this stuff it's really grotesque\nThere'll be a health records they've your financial records you have to give him under penalty of perjury or yellow or they'll come after you give him in and then there late\n\nThe Irish didn't claim anything or the IRS just turned a blind eye don't you know ladies and gentlemen because we all know Donald Trump control the IRS and the Nineteen nineties how ridiculous\nAnd noticed that New York times never produced or something like this on the Clinton Foundation in library right on the nuclear deal\nTwenty percent of the uranium the speeches and all the right now don't bother to the Clintons no no way\nHarder sought to distance Mr Trump from the tax strategies used by his family's saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives in tax professional well of course he dead you know distancing yourself it's the same exact way the family that owns the New York times handles that they don't do their own\nTaxes\nPresident Trump and virtually no involvement whatsoever these matters he said the fares were handled by other Trump family members who are not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law why\nDoesn't the New York times except that point even as they go on they can't accept that point that Trump didn't do his own taxes and then he relied on professionals and others\n[noise] the president's brother Robert Trump issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family are dear father Fred Trump passed away in June of Nineteen Ninety nine\nEleven mother marrying Trump passed away in August two thousand all appropriate gift an

Jordan here remember how they tried to destroy Jim Jordan what ever happened to that\nThey hammered them for about a month and then walked away hammer them for about a month and then walked away no even allegation that he was involved in anything on tour and they claim he looked the other way\nWhen boys were being molested by whomever there and uh he said I don't I don't even know what they're talking about\nDidn't matter he wanted to\nBe speaker they didn't want them to be speaker ... president they don't want them to be president [noise] now you watch the Democrats wave this article or you're saying we need that tax return and then watch some of these these wimps on cable TV who you think are on years\nYes I ah I think they should release them just to be careful I mean the predator he has nothing to hide of course this\nIs how it's done is is how you destroyed people on the right back [noise] month\nNo\nBullets face it we love Alexa and we love the letter find your favorite

[noise]\nWhile we have very few in the Republican side on the Democrats' side how many people who are the politics of adult foolishness to find them and I think every day and one of them\nThank you for your call my friend and the worse the higher up the Democrat chain they go Bill Clinton's accused of rape they nominated for president Ted Kennedy or with Chappaquiddick doesn't require any further explanation or he's the darling of the left and always will be\nWindow right down the list the White House has responded to this New York times hit\nFred Trump has been gone for nearly Twenty years and it's sad to witness this misleading attack against the Trump family by the failing New York times\nMany decades ago the IRS review and signed off on these transactions\nThe New York times and other media outlets credibility with the American people is it an all time low because they are consumed with attacking the president and his family instead of reporting the news the truth is the market is an all time high unemployment is a fifty year low taxes for families and businesses have been cut\nWages are up and so forth and so on [noise]\nAnother apology from the New York times like the one they had the issue after they got the twenty sixteen election somebody recently wrong\nKnow why the Irish didn't look at it they gave it a pass\nSays the New York times isn't this fascinating
