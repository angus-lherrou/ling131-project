J. you know in West Palm Beach I Do a mid morning show because you just can't get enough of me and four hours in South Florida\nTo another one from ... until noon W. I. O. D. in Miami and it is truly an honor and a pleasure to be here anytime I I Am able to join you feel it in for the great one more call in by the way you can catch me\nAt Bryan mud radio on Twitter now\nWrapping up last hour I mentioned that President Trump\nWas likely to be reelected if for no other reason than he is an incumbent president running for reelection historically sixty five percent for nearly two thirds of all the presidents who run will win\nOnly what we have is a presidential election it's about the incoming president so frankly really doesn't matter first and foremost whether it's ... or Pocahontas or whatever\nIt matters who in what Donald Trump is represented wanting to accomplish and you really have to screw up you really have to screw up in order to be in the ... been president and lose if you're running for reelection I'm gonna come back around to the Saudi Arabians and you're in a minute\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left and there's just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not get ration day I had to listen to pin ads around their\nHours he's he's out after the first is going to be a beach but he he would never be a re elected I mean people already seen them say to me\nLike you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at\nWhy don't we take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and for info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yeah I was a four did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nSince the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past few years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nEither way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote for a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from my point of partisanship registered to vote like an all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time of young people to go down registering to vote and then they're all Democrats from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in Virginia last hour\nWho's also conservative too that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that part of the story but beyond that you got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst you you take a look at the economy we have the best economy and the generation\nMillennials from buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through his hearing from a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and do we have this really does suck the euro bomb and they go well I guess he's white and you're given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you got the mines are up and\nThat's the gun in the in the generation\nWe have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end of the Affordable CARE Act mandate employment rate in forty nine years and by the way the unemployment for demographics except Asian and white man yeah remember\nAbout the land and they use them and they will demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out over by the way\nBut you also have the biggest increase in the take home pay in thirty two years ago I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I received a note from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because it's not hard to get their maps\nAnd it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nAnd works like this you take to you\nSalary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it's pays about two point eight percent base salary year over year okay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when\nYou do that that gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employee person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated two sides to stories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the anger leftist that goes yeah but I\nHaven't seen a benefit for the tax cuts well that's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white person like thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not saying that it will be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because of well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that and two years but he is or is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty he probably gets re elected\nSo once things didn't work out exactly the way that we all hope to and we're kind of led to believe that they would I decided I was going to go straight to the source and read the karate\nStarts out by the way and they'll give you the Reader's Digest if you're not familiar starts out kind of like sunshine law Bob sitting by the end it's kinda like hey if you don't see the world the way we do a you die and by whatever means\nNecessary the groundwork ultimately the groundwork under ... now you have is practice obviously many different sects stumbled which are positive ... not ... in all forms is evil\nAnd by the way if you want to argue that three laws not evil again I I guess you can but then you have to make the case that women are subservient to demand that if a woman is raped for example she should still be stoned to death because she had sex with the rapists\nAnd just details you know that if you're homosexual as well it was like about the ... come out and don't understand Israel for for the last ...\nIf you are a homosexual against what he gets down because you are homosexual or a you know these days they they they just got a ... sometimes they don't get the whole formal stoning thing together they they just all show buildings or whatever but the part of the problem\nIn us being somewhat immune from the realities of Islamic terror\nWe can take for granted the safety that we have day to day that is not present elsewhere in the world a little detail for you that you probably were not aware of how many Islamic terror attacks do you think of happened that have been documented around the world so far and\nEighteen say about it for a second got number ... try one thousand five hundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably not a bit higher than what you thought to just today for example and Molly you had a terror attack a woman writing\nHer donkey blown up by Islamic terrorists earlier today in Afghanistan U.S forces as citizens that were bombs by Taliban\nYou probably didn't need to know that yesterday in France you had a man that attack somebody with a chisel raising all\nProbably didn't know about that see even sometimes in countries like France it doesn't get reported over here\nThere's a lot more to that story\nIs that the root of it I guess one\nStill tenets of that in Saudi Arabia\nOr the situation becomes that much more complicated\nBecause of the conversation was just getting going on\nIf you listen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk\nAnd how much time and I

I guess what they mean legal fees Ivey has any money [laughter]\nHe and she had to pay me a lot of legal fees and as a whole lot of animal for this or Texas Lubbock, Texas based on Texas law with a legal fees are nice and pleasant fall and your whole better than to say that you are you serious courthouses disappointed if I say it is a a lot [noise]\nThat was the the president was first Reagan for five minutes or just a few hours ago [noise]\nIn forest shore and there are so many different directions I Want to go either way I Need to trick pony when it comes to references I'm really proud of myself as I graduated from Monty Python or Seinfeld\nAnd the only thing I've had on my mind with what the president has been up to I and I had to go back and pull the plug because there was a magazine it was that the one the Seinfeld episode where I think it was actually Kathy Griffin who ironically enough ah Jerry was talking about said that she does think she should quit\nBut I wanted to be because to me it should be the traditional route years of rejection and failure until she spit out at the bottom of the porn industry help it because I feel like that's what's happening right here except in that case a stormy here you know she started out in the porn industry\nYou knew I was the interesting characterizations of her right\nYou know she'll she'll go from a a certain level of decorum you know she is a an adult film star other time she gets a a porn actress or whatever it's uh it's interesting but nevertheless by the way\nI Am your or south for the friend Bryan mutt doing morning show\nOn WGN in West Palm Beach a mid morning show after that W I O D and Miami\nAnd every now and then I think the Fox is folks at Fox News or run out of radio people to put on TV and they put me on so you I'm a gift contributor to Fox and this is one of the things here and there it's always an honor and pleasure to be able to fill in for the great one more call Dan\nAnd a holy cow or this happened as well related to the whole story Daniels ... saying earlier today the president's out about four hours or so ago\nTweeted out citing Fox News federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump\nTrump is entitled to a full legal fees\nAnd a comment off of that a President Trump said great talent could go after a horse face an earth deliberate a lawyer and the great state of Texas she won't confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a toll con\nOr there you go good old horse face oh boy [laughter]\nSo that happened\nIt got us thinking of some of the nonsensical things that are happening now bear he got the Taylor Swift effect remember a couple of Sundays ago where the earth moved because Taylor Swift he Taylor Swift she did it after years\nAfter years of the entertainment industry and the folks on the left they finally got her to do it\nThat was going to move literally one of the mountains I think in the eastern Tennessee\nThat Taylor Swift effect as she weighed in with her Tennessee values\nWhich the first thing to do with that Taylor Swift is to Tennessee water ... Warren is to Cherokee Indians want all owned\nSmall details I'll get there I uh I couldn't help by itself but to put together some information on Taylor Swift and on the race that she endorsed and her clear lack of understanding of any of it\nWhen I ended up writing this was a headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC ... Taylor Swiss political endorsement could become the biggest red\nAt the polls will ever is a poll [laughter]\nI mean that OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's an actor\nLast way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nBe effective Swiss surprise endorsement which was mainly on Instagram post or felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media recently has a couple of days ago are still my gosh it's happening I think it's quieted down a little bit over the past the hour or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey\nAre you so he was up in Tennessee or the um Taylor's specific endorsement of\nThe Democrat so Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's averaging a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee alright Blackburn three point lead and the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls that particular race is now nine points so\nOh not exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the raised bed she finally weighing in on is negative six percent\nIn a week so does that you've got two sides to stories in one side the facts but here's the deal\nHe got a lot of folks that are filling a familiar with the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction or science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In the south in particular\nYou had a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities better away in the end and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nPretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSafe if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons\nAmong others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values\nBut you see here is that the the dirty little detail Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee\nShe's from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania and she happened only moved to a tendency to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know in the you know Taylor Swift is Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is too too Cherokee Indians you know the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas smelling now\nShe spoke up supporting elegy being he writes\n... rights as part of her Tennessee value is by the way\n[noise] I guess what the Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton than he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's not as much [laughter] so and it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go [laughter]\nAnd then you got the optics we see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in Nashville better yeah\nBut here's the thing anybody noticed that he got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy\nWho does not support gay marriage and host of other old GB T rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania\nSo she's endorsing in the old white guy bad have all these days left his politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\nI mean and there was a lot more we we can continue\nDown that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those into the sea they pretty much get the point to and law law\nIn terms of Tennessee values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and to\nWell not often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't the painting I mean come on\nAll the celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm by the way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean I did the trick is does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see it she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nLA Paul Allen cofounder of Microsoft okay so stay with the entertainment they promote it pedaling here from CNN line Matt Damon total areas SNL skit couldn't stop the cabinet confirmation\nNeeds to be ... you realize that that whole Matt Damon SNL skin was designed they they actually thought it would stop him from being confirmed they take themselves that seriously now\nThat's why Matt Damon apparently took on that role you\nThrough SNL are going to stop this here is a an extra it's hard to imagine a more comprehensive takedown of a political figure than the one Saturday Night live executed on Brett Kavanaugh and it's decent premier last month at a time when the judges said seemed to be hanging in the balance why\nIt's hard to imagine a more operation to take down but Matt Damon playing gathered\nAnd that's it now and he's dead freaking serious Damon added several layers of rather go to Canada I was angry aggressive
