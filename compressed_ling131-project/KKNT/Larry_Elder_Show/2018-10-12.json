everybody knows that you can't you so so the only thing you do is you have to undermine the legitimacy of the person\nYou have to undermine the legitimacy of Marsha Blackburn intent and Tennessee by the way the Taylor Swift at you know she terrifies me I cannot imagine thought\nA it scares me and makes me want to get in a fetal position because she couldn't attack on the issue so you have to attack or on the\nI'm I'm afraid of view you attack the president the same way you say that well the president's really not in charge of this country the Russians and they looted together\nAnd we're going to sell that until we can't sell anymore anymore and this man needs to be a peach and then you do the same thing with county and then you don't like the fact that Brett Kavanaugh's on the Supreme Court so you scream and yell and your throat thing the center of home then you surround them at dinner\nAnd you and you look like an angry mob and then you say it's ... it's it's unfair to call this a mob that we are not an angry mob\nThat you are an angry mob and you are\nScary person and I should be afraid of you and everybody else should be afraid of you know that's what they're running on their running on personal attacks and emotion because there's not\nThe single issue\nAt the Democratic party can run on right now that they can win on you I mean the main core issues you can't tell us we're in an unjust war and innocent people are dying and we need to come home because we're not in a big war right\nRight right that's what they had for years that they ran on you know you want to get it out you want to stop spending all this tax money Iraq Afghanistan you want to get kids to get education and you want to stop spending money on the fence and stop saying these poor boys over to be killed in these women to be killed and since those wars you don't have that this time\nRight you're really right\n... the way most kids make it personal undermined the individual turn the individual into a scary scary person Brett Kavanaugh's rail\nHere's my question to you like what can you start interrupting sugar and what we did with conservatives and especially of African Americans in your opinion to try to stem the tide track I said well it was a crash\nDemocrats I Do believe would have taken control of the Senate if it wasn't for them overplay their hand with Brett Kavanaugh and I think Democrats are angry they're inspired they're\nFurious and they realize and another four years of Donald Trump being president\nCould destroy the Democratic party as we know it because if you have an economy that's doing this well and it keeps doing well and you have trade agreements are being changed and you have American Jobs coming back and you have what when in point in numbers is extremely hard to beat that person\nThey are terrified and but what what I Will say that said we have to go out there and vote and not sit at home and be passive and I think the Brett Kavanaugh as what's going to wake up a lot of Republicans say that character assassination\nThat character assassination of a good man trying to turn them into the worst thing you can call them and what there's only there's only one thing you could do it would have been worse\nSay the child rapist that's it right it's child rape it's been rapist\nAnd they went all in against Brett Kavanaugh and ... and he was collateral damage it wasn't about it it was about honesty wasn't about fairness it was it about a true investigation wasn't it was about trying to destroy a man\nKeep them off the Supreme Court to inspire democratic voters and I think they ever played it I think will hold the Senate and house I really do if we go out and vote\nAnd I appreciate the phone call thank you sir it's

advantage of using him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be

I think Russia and that's the main with the peace if it was published\nFebruary two thousand in current directions and psychological science ... it's the journal of the association of psychological science you are you a new one every couple of years you know you've never let it lapse that's impressive it it's just impressive so why you would\nMeet everybody but the article so these are all professors\nSelf esteem ... aggression from current directions and psychological science from ... from the year two thousand now I'm going to go to it until you address the simple\nOne\nParagraph conclusion violent men\nSeem to have a strong sense of personal superiority\nYou hear that\nI told you this many times citing boy bell meister\nThat in his study of criminals which is his whole life work he found that they had violent criminals had higher self esteem than the general population\nI continue favorable self regard is linked to violence in one sphere after another murderers rapists wife feeders violent eve gangs aggressive nations and other categories of violent people\nAre all marked by strongly held views of their own superiority when large groups\nOf people differ in self esteem the group with the higher self esteem is generally the more violent\nOne that is why the left will be violent and that's exactly right I a lot of time\nIn various trends though that I have brought to your attention throughout my radio career\nIs exceedingly important to understand the roots of self esteem movement they are completely on the left John ... left wing state senator and California I interviewed the man\nI understand where he came from why he pushed forth\nAnd California passed that I wrote against it what you could you take a look what year was\nCalifornia delegated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the self esteem movement and of course it caught caught on we're even conservative parents started thinking about their kids self esteem as being important\nWhy do you think kids get trophies for losing [laughter] why because of the self esteem of but we don't want our kids to feel bad about himself\nWhy not why not\nYou should always feel proud always really no matter the lack of achievement in your life and the political treatment if you're gonna feel just as good about yourself\nIf you fail as if you succeed well Bob ...\nThat I took those that line straight from the study in the journal of psychological science the self esteem movement originates on the left it permeates the left\nThat is the reason normal rules of behavior don't apply you can call the president of the United states a Nazi because the normal rules of moral this course do not apply to you if you're on the left you are so good\nYou are so right and writes us\nThat you don't need\nTo live by ... by the way that is you don't need to live by ... ruled that is the reason remember Amy wax the law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and also on our show\nLiterally half

trouble with the wording south for fame because where how we had our children to have\nSelf esteem knowing that that you are comfortable here you are in fact that was something I almost every day to them remember him ... meaning to different things meaning you're a child to God and you are part of their family\nSo um I guess we have very high self esteem\nAnd I always hard and so someone isn't greener yelling at me or not agreeing with me if it's truly something that I ...\nI wasn't really bother me now I never thought of myself as long as I wrote in any way that I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem so I guess\nWhy a lot of it or you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids are on losing teams\nIt's ridiculous\nOkay so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would work with mine one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child with God I couldn't agree with you more on this self esteem that the psychologist you're talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God I promise you know okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain pressure ... that is unique to every one of us I\nI I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it [noise]\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd ... you know okay there you are even laughing now that so that that proves ripe point so there's there and the other is you believe I Am I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in earned his self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nOkay so I think we're on board on that\nThe self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself\nNo matter how you behaved irrespective of religion ... grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem I think there's a big difference\nI don't see ...
