I work with law enforcement when they're in the system their convictions and maybe they sort of ten years when it comes time to come out there is a painter requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that the only two options\nAndrew will not answer the question that held her name let me wouldn't be willing to release\nEntered into the well of course I I think that the show boating his message out there there's no show boating\nPal I found a lot of that during the course of the debate these cheap shots these uh these dismissive comments showboat there's no show boating go ahead\nWhat ... what would we will do is we will follow the law if you've committed crimes you do that time have through the Utica tore process in a judge issued a warrant for arrest or movement into an ice facility we're actually what\nWe saw what that's not the way it works a judge does not issue in order putting somebody in the ice facility the individual has done time they've been charged they've been prosecuted they've been found guilty their sentence they served their sentence now you have to open the jailhouse store\nIs that person going to wind up in a yellow bus a yellow ice boss the winds up be pointing that person or is that person going to walk out that Joe how store and go on to your neighborhood that's the question\nAnd obviously Gillum takes the ladder position this was a big deal it's a big point he's so radical he doesn't want you to understand the process but that's what mom says turn them over to the feds to deport them ... states can't deport people\nOr they're losing your community\nSo Fifteen dollar minimum wage which will bankrupt many small businesses are chasing them off and by the way it's harmful to many many people who work for instance in the hotel industry the restaurant industry\nForth\nAnd the elimination of Medicare under the guise of health care for all and a massive expansion of Medicaid which is health care for poor people\nYou know the other thing is when you're a state that has all these illegal aliens coming in and Florida is one of them in Texas is one of them and so forth and you're saying you know what we're going to pay for all the health care and medical care related to this and and so forth and so on you're going to be attracting\nMore and more people who need more and more state benefits\n\nSo you're expanding the welfare state while you're expanding the number of people who are on the welfare state\n\nThese are just a few issues that are really destroy a state like Florida or state like Texas don't destroy them as they have these other states\n\nIt's a big deal and that you wouldn't really understand it because tapping ever really follow that he didn't drill down\nHe had his own agenda and of course he brings up the agenda of the Democratic party in Florida so I'm just using this as an example immediately tried to paint the scientist says a racist\nWhich is so sickening and outrageous\nBut that's what they do on the left and the left being the media and the Democrat Party\nThat's what they do meanwhile once again\nYou have an African American running for the Senate in Michigan\n\nAnd he's conservative and he's a capitalist and he believes in the constitution and the rule of law he doesn't get the kind of attention that Gillum guess what I well you know why\n\nIt's the media mentality we talked about the ... matter briefly\n\nI'm trying to figure out how this story winds up being about Donald Trump\n\nHow does this story wind up being about Donald Trump\n\nAnd where does the media get off claiming the moral high ground on human rights abuses all over the world right off our border take place everyday involving\nFar more than one individual mostly go under reported\nYou\nKnow there are legitimate policy questions can we debate those is the president right when he says I'm not going to forfeit a hundred and ten billion dollar purchase of American military armaments which the Chinese or the Russians would sell otherwise\nWhy is that controversial statement\n\nThe purpose of that cell is the benefits us if it purely benefited the Saudis that would be one thing but it benefits America\n\nI mean as I said earlier in the brunt of what the hell we open an embassy and kill but it's only state that torture the murders\nPresident's been attacked\nBecause of his heart policies on China\nI told you Iran has one of the highest execution rates in the world China has the highest execution right in the world as the Tibetans\n\nAsked the other religious minorities in China\n\nAsk any of the political dissidents how they're treated in China\n\nAnd these aren't real trials that take place in China at all\nAll right so what should we do\n\nWhat should we do\nThese are legitimate questions that ought to be engaged discussed\nPolicy thoughtfully considered\nBut his knee jerk around now the media and all that

[noise]\nWell I Want to tell you why wasn't here\nThe last few weeks [noise] first I Want to tell you about my father and many of you\nProbably feel like you know my dad in many respects I've talked about um a lot and my mother\n[noise]\nYou know uh my father wrote an illustrated six books starting at the time he was eighty five years old and his last book comes out on October thirtieth\n\nAnd he had written in illustrated a book in Nineteen sixty five\nThere's an artist some officer very small businessman most of all he was a patriot [noise]\nYou know a\n... plug Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address illustrated\nAs a preface that I wrote\nAnd in order to write it I interviewed my father and I mean formally but I needed to know more about him in our family I learned a lot\n\nOn July for Nineteen thirty seven\nMy father Jack was twelve years old and a neighborhood buddy team in may and the two of them walked several miles from their homes to the parade route where the city of Philadelphia was celebrating our nation's founding\nAnd the roots stretched from center city Philadelphia not too far from independence hall to the Philadelphia art museum which Sylvester Stallone would make famous in his rocky movies\nMany years later one of the dignitaries and the parade caught my father's attention a civil war veteran\nHe's civil war veteran [noise]\nAnd he sat on the back of a four door convertible dressed in his old union uniform including his campaign had my father remembered it vividly\nAnd behind him march the small group of Spanish American war veterans but of all the soldiers the veterans the marching bands my father saw that day that union soldiers stood out\n\nAnd young jak had read some what about the civil war in school but saying that soldier in the flesh and trade to\n\nThese soldier would become seared in my father's mind the most costly war in American history had become real them best began my father's life long journey of self education and patriotic preaching about this great nations history and founding principles\n\nNow the young age my father had a knack for drawing designing and inventing when he was Thirteen you design an automobile window invention for contest the Philadelphia daily news was conducting in conjunction with the release of the movie young Tom medicine starring Mickey Rooney\nHe was one of only five one or city wide and learned a trip the Nineteen thirty nine New York world's fair at Fifteen he submitted an idea would drawings for animating the story Christmas carols are the Walt Disney studio in California\n\nIn the studio ... then they asked that he provide more examples of his work including humorous cartoon drawings that he did\nThen they contacted Jack's parents my father's parents my grandparents and asked whether they would allow their son's Fifteen at the time to join Disney studio they would provide them with dormitory space and schooling at their facility while he was working for them\n\nBut his parents concerned about his age turned down the offer\n\nNow my father grew up during the great depression\nHis family was very poor his father Harry worked at part time jobs when he can find them often as a bartender\nHis mother and my grandmother share I work in a cigar factory jak was the oldest of four children and the only boy when he turned sixteen after the school day and then he would walk to the cigar factory about a mile from their\nHome apartment if you will weigh worked until midnight earning the going rate is Seventeen dollars a week\n[noise]\nOn the weekends

of personality here that I have I have appreciated ... people are this is the America that I that I I really like\nSuch a wise guy America the hyper sophisticated fools that inhabits so many of our urban areas that are have gone to graduate school too long and becomes stupid\nSo that's my that's my initial take\nI hey everybody not just stupid callous jaded mean but other than that I think a okay producing terrific people\nYeah been ... so what is it now seven thousand have you seen pictures of the\nCaravan coming in from largely from Honduras\n\nLike to talk to somebody about how the how did they get through the Mexican border the Mexicans just don't care I I keep remain conflicting reports of it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred forty years at seven thousand [noise]\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question is how did they just haven't such a large group get through Mexico not that I think Mexico cares\nA that was a substantial part of their population lives in the United states in ... Mexico they send back billions of dollars and\nWe take the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially that we're a ... government to Mexico and the United states and the left thinks that that is a terrific thing even though all it does is enable the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are unhappy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in significance compared to the possibility of more Democrats\nBecause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections so that's what they do the import Democrats met an amazing thing is that done anywhere else in the world\nAnd the democracy we import millions of people in order to have you with elected that's what it's about [noise]\nAnd they it's a it's a big question we should have some folks on because the big question here how are they going to be stopped the misses me my fear is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people they're not going to come to the border and they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back a thousand miles or Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what the distances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSay it's a fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to do with the knowledge that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSaying they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just prefer California\n'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches was there was not landlocked to the best of my knowledge so I I don't ah\n[laughter] I have to live in this make believe world\nThat are on the left is created there's no difference between American culture in Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral way to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to flee vast numbers want a fleet they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful are equally wonderful or non wonderful culture get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin American American culture\nThat's amazing I guess while you are so many Americans fleeing to under us why should they be why should they be impoverished they have food they've perfectly perfectly acceptable\nNatural resources the reason Latin America is largely an economic failure is because it's largely corrupt ask our friends in Brazil\nIs is is there a few as ... as intelligent industrious people as the Brazilians but they're mired in corruption corruption is is the greatest problem outside of Iran on the face of the earth\n\nNot global warming my friend's corruption but nobody wants to talk about it because it sounds like you are attacking another\nCulture but I Am attacking another culture I'm not attacking another race or another ethnicity or race or ethnicity or insignificant culture is everything\n\nSo I I don't know what will happen at the border I I don't know how they will be stopped they have but otherwise if you want them in you are aligned to yourself and to everybody else if you deny your for open borders seven thousand people want to come in\nThat seven thousand more voters plus there plus their families the this is for the Democrats this is awesome\nI listen to the political pundits who are divided on this will this will be seen being good I mean we're approaching this hugely hugely nation changing election possibly\nThe American people choose a Democratic House you weren't going to just see a two years of hate filled investigations of the of the presidency\nTo try to bring him down to try to bring removed justice Kavanaugh that's all it will be will do nothing for the United states who will do everything for left wing power\nThe left brings not interested in the United states and its interested in power this is true in every country since lemon not talking about liberals but liberals are cowards they don't fight the left except Alan Dershowitz and and and the Ruben and a few others [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat's the state of things this uh this Monday I welcome you to the show one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six so the question is who\nWill look better or worse for Democrats or Republicans\nIf you want an open border it looks better or for a for the Democrats if you believe that the United states has to protect its sovereignty it's better for Republicans that's the answer but the point is they will undoubtedly be somebody will get hurt I it's very hard\nTo imagine no young man is going a scuffle with any American border enforcement agent and then get hurting and perhaps a child they will be more cameras there as many cameras there was people\nAnd then they will be there will be the usual from the left look what look at the mean spirited president that we have\nTo look at these men and women and children though it's mostly young men but look at these men and women and children the callous mission Xena phobia of this administration that's that's what you'll hear\nAnd they will they will have the you know the appropriate\nAs signs or so appropriate images that they will be able to show on\nCNN and MSNBC ABC CBS NPR PBS di di di di di do do you do you do you\n[noise] that's what it is\nA question of do you believe in the right of a country to have more people can have it's it's I don't understand why why don't people regard the country as they regard their home do you allow anybody into your home is your country not your home I think about this when people let her\n\nWhen a Prager
