makers spend a lot of money lobbying to protect their profits over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars to be fair but there's a bigger lobby in America or politicians must answer too and that's us\nWe want solutions to prescription drug the price of portability you want them now it's time to hold drug makers accountable and put my patients ahead of profits but they have their lobbyists and there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories of oh let's do something about this uh [noise] my next guest\nIs the president and chief executive officer of research Institute that they San Francisco based think tank founded back in Nineteen Seventy nine please welcome back to the program [noise] Sally Sally how you doing [noise]\nDoing great I'm Sally Bernie Sanders wants to Medicare for all can you give us your analysis of what this would do\n[noise] yes it would be a complete disaster as if you know Larry I'm Canadian I grew up in Canada under a single payer\nI started a publication back in Nineteen eighty eight\nI'm I'm waiting your turn a guide to waiting lists the average Canadian family\nUm wait Twenty one point two weeks from thing a primary care doctor to getting treatment by specialist Bernie Sanders want the Canadian health care system that Medicare for all the time has come he wants the Canadian system but even more he wants to add vision care pre drugs\nAnd um and and an entry vision care\nAnd and um you know of course he he has a bill before the Senate which had sixteen co sponsors for them what to become president and of course he never talks about what it would cost and how it would be paid for but it's Charles ... center said thirty two trillion dollars over ten years all\nPrivate coverage under his plan Larry would be outlawed and you know a hundred and sixty million Americans have employer sponsored insurance and the polls show they like it they would lose their coverage immediately and we would all be\nLike people in the u._k. under the national health service Canada under Medicare system\nThe on waiting lists are care would be rationed and our taxes would have to be increased significantly\nSally how would why why does a Medicare for all seem to test so well among Democrats\n[noise] well I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single payer has been around for Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary for the Democratic presidential nomination brought out his first single payer plan you know telling the American people that would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all\nAnd so you know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again that you know who wouldn't want something that's free but as I say he never talked about how it would be paid for and how much it would cost and so and then he has of course is I'm a new young sidekick Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\n... member of the Democratic or social for the America she is going around with Bernie telling candidate you know promoting candidates who support single payer and so it's really a being a very big move to the left for the Democratic party and I think we're going to see in this midterm election on November six\nAre these candidates who are running to the left that Ben Jealous or for governor of Maryland this I'm Andrew Gillum who is running against um [noise] the Santa for the governorship in Florida how do these people do to the American people are they finally understanding by people like you and me tell educating them on\nHow terrible it would be what the costs to be their tax burden and you know in the latest poll um study out of the American association of medical colleges\nThey're predicting a shortage of a hundred and Twenty one thousand doctors\nBy twenty thirty because so many dogs at sixteen percent increase so many dogs you know quit medicine under Obamacare but the thought of being under a single payer system where Bernie says they would be paid for forty percent below\nWhat they're paid now um because they their salaries their payments would be tied to Medicare for this war and courage and more doctors to quit and the best and brightest young people not to go into medicine\nShall we talk to me about a pre existing conditions I thought it was an assault on the on the insurance model to force insurance carriers to take people with preexisting illnesses now hearing Republican say hey hey Democrats don't say that we're going to take away preexisting conditions because we're not I'm confused\nWell I Know it's very confusing and of course it's all goes back to the fact that when Trump was running as president and the Republicans were running in the twenty sixteen presidential they promised that they would repeal and replace Obamacare unfortunately you know by the early fall at twenty Seventeen they hadn't been able to do it and it wasn't done\nUm we're seeing some very good things being done through the administration secretary Alex aides are you know expanding I'm short term a limited to ration plans association help out a lot of things are happening\nBut this issue of preexisting conditions keeps coming up and the Republicans I think though that are in tight races are getting squishy on the issue the the point is that there are only about six\nThirty\nWho are in the individual market who are I'm going to have serious of chronic\nOr ... so so let me take a break right here and we come back you could finish your thought

armed American radio I mean I hear my mom you know\nAll we can you really talk about that subject for one hour every week oh my gosh\nSix days of radio and I don't have enough time and we've got so much to cover for you today\nAnd I was going to to go there with you immediately because I've got a great guess wind up Alan Gottlieb will be here momentarily followed by Rhonda ... from Chicago as can be great interview followed by a W. R. Hawkins from Breitbart News followed by a four hour with Dr John Lott\nWho I Know is frustrated and I I spoke with him today but I Can't wait to bring in the program today [noise] excuse me I bear with me I Am getting over a cold and I don't want to keep reaching back behind me to the board hitting mute so if you hear me every once in a clearing my throat bear with me I Do apologize\nBut I got I got to start the day off we start the hour off with you here today with this I got a phone call this morning\nFrom on my studio and I generally don't ever answer that phone I don't even know the number but it was ringing incessantly and continue doing so I decided I'd pick it up and tell a telemarketer where to go\nWhen I heard ... this is Mike ... LDC British radio how you did I and I am doing just fine Mike how are you he's just wondering if you might be able to join Kevin McGuire with us on the radio today\nIn about Fifteen minutes so I did and there is a big article that I just found the moments ago Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now this guy you know anything about Kevin McGuire\nKevin ... is a longtime political a journalist pundits and radio hosts very well respected in England he's also so far left he's ready to fall off the planet\nThere is a clip here that's attached I Want you to take a listen to what I have to do is give you a theater of the mind\nBecause you can't see Kevin the clip is a video of him on the air with me he's letting me talk and the whole time he's rolling his eyes these huffing and puffing his shirts coming off he's wrong on his shoulders back\n[laughter] and after about eight to ten minutes of being on the air with him and my complete thorough utter destruction of him I Want to read you a quote from the bottom from one of the readers of this piece of take a listen to see how I did hear how they do\nSee if I can get the pop up here I Hope I can hear we cannot do it I might not be able to do it well we'll have to maybe pulled it up in the later segment here or maybe in the end and understand what you might give me one more shot on this I just pulled the ... minutes ago so it's possible I might not be able to get a Toronto but we're going to try it again\nA background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward Kevin and that's the problem that we have these people I I can list thirty mass shooters in America who passed background checks we want we want to the problem is there are guns in American as Paul said if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun\nCan in America and it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very very complex issue as I said there are hundreds of millions of firearms in this country now your response was banned assault weapons well first of all I bought my first a are Fifteen during the Clinton assault weapons ban there are\nTens of millions of these guns in America that aren't going anywhere so it's wishful thinking it's easy to be a jerk reactions say my God we have to band is in reality that's not going to work\nBecause they can't be bad they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their lawfully own firearms who have done nothing wrong with their firearms fast majority of this complex and it's frustrating and I feel your frustration as an American we hate to see those were the ones that will just stop\nWell we don't care for people murdering people it's insane\nThe fifth of Americans with guns or intimidating look the full fifth not do not I don't know I don't want your phone or any more I don't want your thoughts and prayers any more than ...\nNow he went ahead and got does what liberals do he lost the argument he got very ... me and he cut off my Mike now\nWas an excuse me it was an awful lot of fun but I Want you to take a listen to a comment at the bottom of the article and then we're going to go to my first guest and this was promoting Martin Palmer's to know the interview was longer than that one minute and forty second clip but\nHe was completely utterly destroyed this Kevin ... loose Kevin Maguire is an MBA so in a ... one of the ... the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present or got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he swam down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nSo apparently after he hung up on me\nHe went off on me on the air and that's fine I couldn't care less what losers do\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I'm disgusted by this presenter by the way what on earth as American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it isn't like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year the New York let me go\nDirectly to Alan Gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation and have some fun with this as we move into other topics with you today Alan how're you\nSign mark that sound like a ... outside of the little little exchange there\nWas a lot of fun and for somebody like you who has a has a lot of experience and you know people coming after you and you know these interviews are going to be set up I've I've been on with with um with Kevin in the past so I knew what was coming we know it was interesting how he before he interviewed me\nHe interviewed a gentleman by the name of Paul with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette who absolutely nailed and said essentially kind of what I said\nBut he talked about more of the complexities of the issue he went deeper into why it's impossible why gun control laws don't work et cetera Kevin McGuire never set a thing to him never questioned him when he came after me because he's had me on before and he knows I'm armed American radio and not a journalist with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nSo he you know he tried to attack me when he got put in place and I thought the comment from the uh from the reader of the article in Britain today was wonderful and uh I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nWell I think he did a marvelous job uh unfortunately you're not going to change his mind or probably a significant amount of his viewers because his viewers of people just like him otherwise they wouldn't be viewing a\nBut he did a very good job and you know that's the expected ... getting at at a a left wing person from getting\nA delight people control I mean they like to control people it's just a problem is in Britain\nThey don't get to control the criminals that he wants a running wild [laughter] [noise]\nYeah and they were the he doesn't like to talk about crime in Britain and so forth but now Piers Morgan put a tweet out the other day too I found this fascinating Pittsburgh shooters reporter to using they are Fifteen in the preferred weapon of choice for most mass shooters in America Sandy Hook Vegas et cetera and John Lott will be here later to tell us that that's not true\nBecause they kill lots of people very fast this is what they look like Louis Post a photograph of us will people scary or Fifteen and he says I ask again why the ... are these legal for civilians and my reply was quite simple\nBecause tens of millions of responsibly armed Americans use them safely responsibly every single day\nNow how much of this argument now are we going to start seeing because of Pittsburgh I Want your thoughts now on how you think this whole thing is going to build up over the coming days and weeks ... by the mid term\nWell before I answer that I'd like to point out that this particular murderer than just having a are you also have handguns with them as well [noise]\nUh and we don't know what what what kind of see actually used to do all the firing of how they throw it was quite bullets torch guns so when they go like to pick on the assault weapons you know if you're banned assault weapons has got to walk into an unarmed unprotected you know in synagogue\nOur nobody had a firearm to protect themselves because of their country policy uh and if he didn't use the R I could eat it probably did uses handguns anyway\nSo the problem here is is that none of this works and they just don't want to admit to it now and answering your question how it's going to play out there's no doubt that he pulled his gun rights ... they can try and spin it you know the evil of guns ...\nAh there's just there's two ways about it I'm not sure anybody could begin to buy it because I think the American people just play ... recognized attack if this was a hate crime I can committed against people of religion\nOr that took a crazy crazy person to do this that was a you know obviously murder that have a A R R as ... as you could walk in with a pipe\nBomb as well and and kill more people so the problem here is is that it isn't about guns and at the American people get it so I'm not too concerned about how this can impact the trauma lectures\nI've I'm with you on that in fact I'm with you on that a hundred and ten percent at some things you can feel in your gut listener union I Know you know this you get that gut feeling I I'm not getting that gut feeling I've learned over many years in business and\nAnd just doing this that you you learn to trust your gut my gut instinct is generally always right at least ... percent of the time now and I'm I'm kind of feeling the same thing you know I like to point out that people would have\nHad I had the opportunity before he not hung up on me because he was destroyed and couldn't argue with me any more but\nIt's the fact that for example when we show in Virginia Tech used a glock Nineteen and a twenty two to murder thirty two people and they don't want to hear that because they're okay with handguns than when you hit him with that they really get mad and pick their toys that a little while and like you know they're getting\nI Wish we had the money to compete and I feel that same about winning I I'm hoping ugly actually is can be strong enough to not not Taylor ballot measure but if we don't win is a political putting its dollars it bought the election\nWhat concerns me about that I agree with you on that statement I'm not real I wasn't that statement concern me somewhat as I mentioned but here's really\nBecause I didn't I don't want it to create complacency I think statement like that can create some apathy on our side with what we've got the grassroots look what the interests that they're not really worried about it my five boxes enough\nOr well I I just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about ... that's what concerns me about that and I know the wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our duff we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance here let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative\nThat six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say\nYou felt better last week and you did this week is that a fair statement\n[noise] oh yeah that that money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars that I feel as good as they get last week\nI don't feel it within the last minute money coming in from three big donors schoolwork being one of those\nAnd you know one of the problems we have is he going to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes can't believe you're on the letter Rick uh and sometimes it it it's better to let people know who they are the battle you know I always say that are actually won election away from extinction and it's really true\nIt absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes s a F joins California group suing riverside county sheriff overseas cw policies this is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights\nA legal American resident tell us about this one real quick\nListen to share this decided because California this is ... she says carriers get discretion of what they want to do you say that if you're a legal you know residents who are on hold again you know in in the Sacramento a lo and behold you you you can't\nYou know and wherever I can I should say you you can't get a permit to carry it for self protection or we once it gets all across the country well when your students well a and the sheriff or he pretends to be pro gun but he he hardly get permits out in ... in this county and he's even kept reelection battle right now\nSo let's go probably happening you eat good chance to lose the election and the new chef coming in will move to suit for us and we'll win or because those are issues permits or we'll go to ... for the court battle and lobster and the court overturned it\nSheriff Stanley Smith a sniff is actually pro gun he's pro his gun\nHe's just not pro your gun hopefully all of

sisters who took part in this time ... magazine project as representing themselves as a gun owners they had the opportunity to kill their personal stories\nThey told they found the hearts they had the ... the passion didn't go there not knowing if they were going to be well chef they\nAccept it but nevertheless it was a grant a project they did well they did great and for all the people that went there to represent\nScholarship or the the secular left side of things because how often do you get\nTo kill your personal story what happened in your life and how it happened and have sought to portray it in a more rural or led on the front page of time magazine and I think that's used for us that were invited that we're able to go out and partake in this because nationally\nGun ownership in America don't often get to see the positive side of things you know what I'm saying\nSo ... that was that was huge I'm Glad you brought that up because I'm going to be talking about that time mural cover in the next hour with their W. R. Hawkins also but let me point out to listeners what what it is round is talking about what you said mural\nThe cover of time it's actually a piece of art done by Jay are the artist and what they did was they pieced together two hundred and fifty four people from all sides\nOf the gun debate all sides everybody from Shannon watch all the way over to the ...\nAnd are good for even get to ask you on this thing and when you have her over the digital version their silhouette pops up and you can click on it and actually listen to their story it is quite fascinating now I'm going to have to go through as you know probably ... can get all the ... two hundred and fifty four of 'em and I will\nYou know and if it's going to be it's going to be quite the project but I thank you for bringing that up now we got about ... but\nNo I just wanted to get out of there because you know if it was a great thing and it spread that gun owners or to a supportive to get a positive energy that they got from this because those women and the oatmeal with their input their heart out you know they told their personal stories\nAnd and they don't get hurt as often so you know big up to that because we in two thousand and I think D.C project will be back in Washington DC so I'll get to tell you more about that later\nYeah and you know the fun part about the time thing was a lot of people that you've never heard of before it wasn't everybody that you see or hear like me on radio and everything else it was a lot of regular people out there\nThat are telling these stories again from both sides and it it's quite fascinating I'm looking forward to going through the whole thing rounded with about another we've got about another minute Chicago guns matter the ... the website it's great it's Chicago guns mattered dot org\nYour pictures up there and it talks a little bit about you so I Want to encourage listeners to make sure to go over and check out Chicago guns matter dot org and you're going to find out a whole bunch about what it is we're talking about here today know round it did you do we don't want to miss anything did you have anything else you wanted to cover with the next minute before we have to fly\nShould let me call is very\n\nCross marine officers duty you know [laughter]\nOr American radio now the white hair arm because the last woman I get here and we're making the second amendment by hand a very strong supporter of the second amendment\nInforming hand Andrew training responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast here is your host of armed American radio\nBar called her\nTo armed American radio [noise]\nThis is a this show is flying right along I'll tell you if this hour's anywhere near like the last hour the segments were just flying by so I Want you to make sure you buckle and okay going to be an awful lot\nAn awful lot of content being covered we're going to move very quickly said I Want to read a comment oh first time we start with this kind of as I open up the previous hour in case you missed it I'll start with this I did a\nNational radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not that I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and the international interviews after something like this happens they kind of reach out to me on that have been very friendly to them over the number of years so and I certainly don't mind doing it I Love talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just they're elite smuggling is at the top\nThat doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with him especially when you know you're gonna get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but uh the article after my appearance on the show is titled it made I guess pressure that on the LDC leaving leaving Britain's conversation\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now see day in light of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire spoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get his view on gun laws and your mark seemed adamant that stricter background checks\nWouldn't help the situation\nAs quoting me a background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could name thirty mass shooters in America who had all pass background checks quoting the again if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun he can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue mark and mark went on to claim\nThat a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\n[noise] it's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to band is in reality that's not going to work because they can't be bad they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see this were the ones that want this to stop\nHe claimed however at this point Kevin seemed to lose his patients referring to gun supporters who have recently spoken out in defense of gun laws in the U. S. Kevin responded that the Americans with students are intimidating the pool if they do not\nKevin ended the discussion by telling mark oh I don't want your thoughts and prayers anymore then he hung up on me\nThey didn't say that and then he hung up on the end of the interview and apparently unbeknownst to me went off behind my back which is proof positive that you won the argument because these guys can't stay in the kitchen they like to go to the sandbox they they can't play with the big Bush\nSo the videos on there if you want to go see it I just Google that will be see\nKevin McGuire clashes with us gun rights supporter and take a look at it I put it out on my Twitter page if you want to see it at a A R mark at a A R mark what's funnier than anything is to come down below\nFrom Martin Palmer stuff who says this cabin isn't in Brazil and rude ignorant one is that the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present or got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he slammed down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I Am disgusted by this presenter\nBy the way what on earth does American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it is it like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year than in New York so\nI I enjoy reading that because I just thought before we went on air and I think it makes for great fodder to open up this discussion right now with a W are Hawkins from Breitbart News\nWho I think will agree with me and some of the things I said you can actually listen to a minute and forty two seconds it was much like your interview but he was thoroughly crushed eight of you are welcome to the show my friend so did I say anything in there that ah that you felt was\nUntrue by background checks are assault weapons or bans are confiscation or anything like that\nNo you're right you're basically stated commonsense position and uh just the truth and uh that's it they can't handle it that's the bottom line I just can't handle it\nThey're not open not only they wanted originally from about but the whole level they're not open to the fact that there will do that\nAnd it's not just as individual not talking about Brits were talking about every every left the the things the way he does this guy's got classic American leftist socialism disease a truly does\nA and it's it it was fascinating I I've I've clashed with the guy before and I hope to do so again I appreciate them having me on the show it's an awful lot of fun and I like when they get so angry that they can't argue anymore you know they just they get so flustered that they have to hang up the phone and and then you know talk about you behind your back because they can't win the argument\nOn the merits now let's go to Pittsburgh for a minute or two or three or four or five or however many want to cover a W are\nWhat went through your head when you saw this as someone who covers this every single day and winds awards for doing so what went through your head when you first saw the news on Pittsburgh\nImmediately a like a ... or do what the question was going free [noise]\nAnd uh so it's prime target you know you get a lotta people congregate it in a place where you at a school workplace church where there's no armed protection\nAnd uh you gotta have ... I think they said he was in charge for twenty minutes I'm correct [noise] uh that that you know um [noise] that was the first thing that went through my mind and I'd say the next thing we're just goofy horrible for the family\nBut you know the last talks all the time but how they get tired of the stores are getting tired of this happening in six less gun violence or the or else they say I get tired of it happening too I get tired of law abiding Americans living\nTheir lives in areas where there's there's no there's no good guy with a gun and uh that's what has changed in my opinion that's what that's what was on the on line at the end of the day at the end of the day I look back on what Trump said which I covered\nAnd then I thought he did remarkable you know he did that we really did it he said I Wish we had our security there and he said also on speed up the death penalty so that will people do these kind of thing they know they're going to die and they're going to die quick and I think I think I think those are the two logical approaches to this from this point\nIf you don't do a place where there's not a good guy with a gun don't be the good guy without a gonna go to like make sure you're in a place for their own protection and due call your Sanders representatives let's get some laws change\nSo that people do it to the liberty of living on death row for years and years once they're found guilty\nAnd they have their appeal that's it kill them there's no reason for taxpayers have to find some art or his life and that's what a life sentence ends up being\nAt California you're listening in a number of studies right now you're listening in Sacramento right there in your state capital and you're listening in Southern California you're listening in the bay area my gosh you eat a death sentence in California is nothing but mere show which is simply window dressing\nAnd you're paying for it you're paying for that\nAnd I I don't know that it even bothers people out there anymore I really truly don't but it's interesting because I can use this as a Segway now to your first piece that I wanted to talk with you about today perfect just works just amazing how we're able to do that on this program Chris Murphy mocks Trump for wanting armed security in places of worship Chris Murphy\nChris Murphy is a gun hating ballot lunatic left his socialist from Connecticut\nMarks ... for wanting armed security in places of worship go ahead and take it away before we have to go to the break\nTold me that sets it you know and they tried to be ominous he said Trump on ... and he said he won't semi automatic ... a gunman with semi automatic rifles in every school and rest Scott and go to Tom does want any such thing\nNow but he used the phrase semi automatic rifles just to be like ooh and make a sham scary but guess what\nIf you had had an army officer in the synagogue with a semi automatic rifle\nHow grateful would we be right now because we'd had eleven people here with us that are going on and who would be dead but one animal that deserve to die but managed to live through it and that's why uh the little semi automatic trades doesn't bother me at all in my truck for warning warning on protection for innocence\nBut that's not going to be a sign will be a winning ... Democrats so out they'll keep pushing it\nI Hope they do too and we'll all kind of throw in my little exclamation point on this as we head into this breaking W. R. because apparently Senator Chris Murphy has no problem with armed protection for himself and his colleagues on Capitol Hill\nAnd uh you know again I Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh this is where we are society you know people use the wrong terminology\nYeah and I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time I you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't comment dopey guy you know he's entitled to his opinion and we have fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so\nBut you know I I catch myself to you know it's impossible not gonna sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out due the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan type deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say and but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at me W. R. if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that and we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out without turning the argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know what let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just as out in the lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very very dishonest man is what he is\nBut we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason because doesn't that go that headline alone says it all I W are and that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand the evil exist evil\nChooses the time and place to become evil not ... and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\n[laughter] true true but you know there's there's something I'm trying to call them trying to turn as hard as\nI think what I write ... I Know what I Do I write news but also on in my heart to educate people and and there's a corner I'm trying to turn where I can somehow get people to think about\nThe fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to be profound uh it's very simple gun control is not an apple substitute for freedom and if you think it is\nAnd he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to park on\nOr you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a cake twenty eight pain or he didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth twenty Seventeen I keep going but a gun control is not\nA valid substitute for freedom because gun control priest poses that if we limit everybody's freedoms\nAnd certain crimes won't go away it does not work that way what happens is when you limit my ability to exercise my God given rights you put me in an unnatural position\nOr had been a member of the congregation on Saturday I would've come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that us that we can't do it every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying that's a good substitute for freedom folks there is no\nGood substitute for freedom there is not one that works\nAnd that's why a framer went out of their way to hit you in the second ...\nWell said I'm not even gonna stop that is the exclamation point on that a perfect place to take a break you know I I got to say this on another note that when it comes to\nArming oh my God we wouldn't Trump wants to armed guards who we are guards in bank we armed guards in government buildings\nHell is the problem with defending\nWhere we gather that are targeted by evil [noise]\nDon't know the odds you give them possible to get into their head and it's hard to wrap your head around it back W.

M. C. D. armed text it to eight seven to two two and again PSA here for you don't do it while you're driving smarter than that that's why you listen to the show a W are ... let's go to\nWhat you wrote about a student's bill of rights\nFor state for communities I've read this in in its entirety I'm going to go through each one with you this is the stupidest thing I think I've ever seen in my life and what it is it's just a bunch of people getting together to put something on paper and feel like they did something I Can't think of any other reason for this can you\nKnow no it's it's a you could tell was written about kids it's ignorant\nEstablish a school safety committee whose meetings are open to the public at every school equally\nCompose the student's parents than faculty so ... safety committee I don't know what that means they don't tell us to provide immediate access to qualified counselors and safe spaces so good lord\nFor students of all demographics at all levels of education off case you didn't realize that this was coming from the left do big left hooks all you had to do is look at safe spaces was that a giveaway to you too\nRight yeah well I mean this is laughable it gets worse so that's the worst\nPart it does go here encourage all school personnel to foster positive relationships at all levels of education in okay provide professional development around mental health awareness and interventions were students parents than faculty provide professional development around mental health awareness I don't know what that means to you by chance\nYou know I ... I don't think they do either\nOkay but it sounded kind of important the way it was written\nNumber ... require cultural competency require caught and it wasn't as careful require cultural competency and be asked elation trainings each quarter for law enforcement provided by the local police department in conjunction with equity training organization and companies\nA boy you want to tackle that one\nWas just stupid it's more of the list and what the left doing the police the bad guys they're the ones they learn how to be asked the escalate no this I rarely do I see a police video I think that also got messed up normally you see a police video they tell the guy put your hands up\nStay still don't ... the guy who's he stands up puts his hands his pockets reach for something to get shot\nAt just how that works like a ... if you're that ignorant a bit and you know should just you shouldn't be in a car driving her animals you may have a chance to get you an officer 'cause you ... to ... to to talk to him so yeah this makes police look like they're the calls the problem and that's a clock classical left his position\nIt certainly is and it was a give away with cultural competency that was the give away right there before the rest of that or whatever it did [noise] excuse me as I fight the cold I Apologize right now\nIn the ... one of the things they're cultural competency see they don't since they're left is they're not capable than I thought a but if they were they'd have to realize that whose culture do\nYou have to be competent in they didn't find that because it does that mean but cultural competence a competency in the culture that we see in Saudi Arabia where only look we can go out or is it the culture in another Middle East company\nCountry where women have to be completely covered only their eyes could show is that going to be competent in or do we need to be competent in a culture where they they don't love their neighbors but the Lakers I mean which culture are they talking about see they want to because they want to be multi cultural embrace everybody so who decides which culture camp that's another mess in the city\nIt is and it's a great question to ask and one that they won't have an answer to if you were to ask them that no one asked them that in the meeting where they discussed this nobody brought that up that's why it's there but you know something\nElse I Want to point out about these police officers too that maybe these kids might want to think about and that is sometimes like happened here in the state of Georgia last week sometimes officers simply approach a vehicle and get shot and killed\nAs they're approaching the vehicle sometimes that happens sometimes at Georgia State highway patrol officer pulls a vehicle over on interstate Seventy five and gets shot at\nIn this case had an opportunity to fire back sometimes officers are murdered in the line of duty before they even have an opportunity to say Hi how are you today the reason I'm stopping you is wake up children wait but hell\nUp number six implement\nEquitable funding to traditionally under resourced schools specifically allocated

written by kids the treatment I shouldn't have said that some kids are Nick but these kids are the kids who wrote this\nYou can tell that they've been educated about people who just pass them for one class to another because they don't even know how to use the language\nAnd done it in a left wing faction and fed them a left wing ideals\nAre reduced to go back to the velocity around I I had a\nWalking to the dentist for your show\nComing to you from uh [noise]\nThe twin cities in Minnesota\nThink specifically in Minneapolis I don't think I Would say pull those St Paul yesterday in Minneapolis today I Am so fair minded [noise]\nThat I Do that when I come to the twin cities I take care of each twin\nWe have a truly remarkable evening last night about him I was about seven hundred

[noise] I Wish there was an evening that I I I Wish every left wing or in the country could have seen what what\nHow we talk just amongst ourselves and the civility of it and the lack of a tribute it would be fascinating to contrast that with a similar evening of people on the left to an audience on the left but\nI don't know how I Would do it but I Would like to talk to about a little more later 'cause I Want to talk a little bit about the last question I was asked put it in the meantime they have found a suspect\nOr they have arrested a suspect in me and to use the\nOther even know what to call that will be real bombs whatever they were sent to all these people on the left and that so far it looks like it looks like a man is a a a coup God in the right\nAnd uh he has a a they have his vantage ban is\nPlastered with Donald Trump stickers and the like so we will ah let's see we have even more information just coming in now he's in his fifties\nAnd let's see what else we can say a rest made in connection with male explosive devices white van outside plantation auto zone appears to be focused over investigators and if you get the pictures of it or you\nCan see the the the pro Donald Trump\nStickers and people look if it's conceivable the guys on the left that he wants to make believe these all the right but I suspect that this is the real deal he's simply a he was already it's interesting he'd already been arrested in the past he has a record for making terror threats\nWhy people who make terror threats are not in jail is one of my\nRiddles I don't understand that ... they have to actually acted out [noise]\nYou can't threaten death terror and the like and that would be sufficient to place you are in prison I I don't know I'm a I'm just a question that I'd posing [noise]\nSo what is going to happen and it's already happening is you see we told you it's a Trump rhetoric that cause the Trump rhetoric that caused the truck prior to Donald Trump to the left and the right got along great\nSo left was not calling a ... all of us all of us all of us racist and all I I'm not ... they were not calling the police a racist and even on occasion pigs this none of this was happening\nGuy who pay portrays the police's pigs on his socks in a in a a football game in a is a chosen by Nike to be spokesman ... this is all this is all because of Trump presumably\nA windmill Charles Murray uh one of the most thoughtful up people in the country or it goes to speak at Middlebury College and or is it physically attacked the ... and a woman ... professor with him he's injured by left wing students now that's all Trump She ... this is the amazing thing\nOnly only the rights views hate is is the lie to one of the grand ... because they have to do that for myself the grandest of the laws\nThe greatest of the law is is that America is racist will be the other number one is that we were Nazis right I mean come on\n... and ... you remember how fast the steam Scalia and the of the shooting at at a Republican congressman putting a baseball game or how fast that disappear\nFrom the news I mean you get updates on Steve's squeezes a condition and that would be it\n\nBut now this thing uh right right it before the elections I mean this guy aside from just being ... evil in his in sick is stupid stupid\nIt would be if if if the left could have it invented the guy they would have invented the guy if he turns out to be the right wing or that it that it apparently he as I say apparently\nBecause of the of the fan but as soon as I heard ... ... ... ... in the beginning I thought this could this could well be a guy on the left because it's so often these hoaxes to take place\nBut that's more information came into my thought about a moron I realized who the targets for it's hard for me to imagine these these were the ideal targets of somebody who does have people on the left I don't know if the people on the left would have picked the same targets if they were trying to blame the right\nWill find out more and I will let you know any more information as it is revealed to the public of the United states of America [noise] so I have a very interesting thing for you here very interesting\nToday uh let's see David Brooks in the New York times who ... the the New York times has three columnist author of about twenty\nThat are knocked on the left and David Brooks is one of them\nThere were none that are on the right\nThere are non leftists which is fine but they're they're not really on the right I never words I don't I don't believe I Know for a fact there was not a single pro Trump columnist of the twenty twenty five coalition of the New York times not one\nHalf the country is pro Trump and not a single columnist they could not find a human being in the ... I take that back of course they could find a human being they would not publish a human being who was pro Trump on the opinion page\nOr on the New York times of the New York times so but David Brooks is not is not on the left and he was just the average age of centrist but I mean he's quite anti Trump but he wrote a piece in which he spoke about how beautiful nationalism is that he is a nationalist there's not a global ...\nWhich in the New York times that gutsy thing to do of course he spoke about how Donald Trump\nIs probably a good nationalist either because otherwise he would be kind of acceptable to the New York Times' readership defeated also attack\nDonald Trump I'm not saying about sincere that I'm fairly telling you that that's what happened\nBut the article the column was a pro nationalism pieces you I remember I spent some time on that it's very important the president said he's a mashable list any attack the global lists and he was laughed at CNN and I played the laughter I mean they actually laughed at it\nSo now I what I find even more interesting than the columns or the comments by readers so I Want to retrieve some of the comments of New York times readers to New York times\nColumn ... the virtues of nationalism and what she says I Love my nation you know and it's a good thing to love your nation and my you know I I feel more for my nation than I Do for another nation just as I feel more for my family that a number of family\n\nAnd I want other nations to love their nation right all of which I Am said very often myself so listen to some of the some of the letters that are written and again I'll give you updates are with regard to um anything in Florida here with the suspect on the bombing\nSo here number one ... this is talk of the times\nPicks a half times picks there were three are\nThere are three ah lists that the word three lists of comments that New York times picked list the readers picked list and all so this is the times pick\nThat sounds like patriotism to me and there's a difference nationalism is historically been used to know the superiority of the nation to the detriment of other nations in the world community nationalism as arrogance and false pride\nShow I Am about this this has nothing to do with the bobber I Want to ask a question about Megan Kelly [noise] so I keep reading how she's a racist and she's a racist and she's a racist and she may be raised I I I don't know\nHer I I don't particularly care for her but I Do have a great care for truth so it'd be a one of the big examples biggest constant examples is that she said that Santa Claus is white\n\nNow let me say for the record that I Love seeing black Santa clauses and Asian Santa Claus is I Love it I think it I think that is truly the spirit of Christmas\nTo see a the idea of at Santa Claus can only be why that would be that would be racist I think [noise]\nBut eve Santa Claus the ... the legend of Santa Claus coming from Europe and coming and and the you know for kids another disease from the north pole the people in the north\nWell I guess really north I guess you might be more of a number of me think of it a an Eskimo\nBut anyway it's an ... it's an odd that charge is that if if if you hang your hat on she said Santa Claus is white\nAh [noise]\nIt doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks that blacks should be mistreated\nOr that they are inherently inferior in some way I Would tell me I'm very I really am curious 'cause I I'm not I'm not up on my or triggers here\nNow that's an interesting thing just said to me by Sean so this is joy bay are dressed as a a beautiful\nAfrican woman for Halloween this is from twenty sixteen\nOr I look I I don't know the rules are very complex I got to tell you as you know the University of California has a\nBig list of micro aggressions thing that you could things you can say fat\nReveal that you're a racist I mean you are racist if you say you you don't do the only race you think exists as the human race\nThat actually that actually man and one or the other thing I think you though ... thank you for working that hard and moves me it ... me that they're showing his working that hard\nAll right anyway any any more news on all of that or I Will ah will bring it through attention won a Prager seven seven six or our lines are working today is everybody checked on the lines\nWere good All right [noise] but I I Will get back because\nYou have no idea how revealing it is [noise]\nHow much the word nationalism\nRankles people on the left [noise] and you know this is not theoretical stuff\nIf you don't believe in nationalism why stop the caravan [noise]\nThere's no nation international in your is it\nFor you to protect them as you as your nation
