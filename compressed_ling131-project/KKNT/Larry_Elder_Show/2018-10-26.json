to commit a mass murder attack\nPlease don't get me wrong he says\nA lot of the speech we're hearing from politicians as reprehensible it's a sign of the time by the way from the media to Andy it's a

based on a\nMan [noise]\nHere are number eight seven seven three one three eighty one one have seven seven three one two three one would like to swing into another issue here [noise]\nYou know I objected [noise] and I object now on the left and the Democrats constantly interfere with our economy [noise] one industry after another one industry after another degree with me\n\nThe Democrats are always wanting to regulate industries they're always wanting to tell them what to do they're always wanted to set up their price structure and their employees structure and all other structures in our industry we don't support that too we\n\n[noise] I mean the way you crave more products in the way you drive down costs since we're less government right less government interference\nI mean that makes sense\nTo Democrats constantly want to drive up the cost of domestic steel\n\nWhich results and you're paying more for pickup trucks and\nYou truckers out there for your Eighteen wheelers and people who want to buy purchase a car drives up the cost of Homs because believe it or not they're stealing your homes are still in a lot of stuff is what drives up costs and the Democrats are always wanting to drive up costs why use that\nAs a payoff district union says that it\n\nAnd it makes it much more difficult to export our products because it's much more expensive to create them to to build them right to construct to manufacture them\nAn automobile for instance if it costs two or three thousand dollars or more to build an automobile in this country because the Democrats drive up across the steel well then we're not going to export as many automobiles and what happens to the or to the auto workers well\nThey don't fare too well do they what happens to the American manufacturing or auto makers while they're going to fare less well to\nSame of the people build motorcycles I'm really tired of the Democrats doing this\nBut Democrats have been talking for decades have basically controlling pharmaceutical companies\nControlling the cost of pharmaceuticals well how are they going to control the costs of pharmaceuticals how do they know what the cost of pharmaceuticals ... the we talked about this the other day the billions of dollars that these companies spend\nTo find to make to figure out what works and what doesn't work and most of the time they fail that's why there's a significant cost for a certain types of medicines\n\nAnd we talked about the poverty programs they have for people who can actually show that their income is at such a level that they can't afford super expensive medicines and so forth but the Democrats want to control that Bernie Sanders talks about all the time\nMore\nGovernment interference how's that government going to know what the charge for something\nI don't know\nWhen you look at us and all that they're not what started as an alternative to natural gas and oil because what OPEC was doing to us we're now the biggest producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the year we don't need ethanol and I don't want any calls about it I don't want to all the self serving caused by we get 'em all I'm not interested\nWe don't need ethanol we don't need to use wheat\nAs part of an element and making gasoline for your car and for most cars\nIt's very damaging\nSo basically what subsidy seizing people who have\nWho produces seven oh we don't need it the environmental issues to push it now they backed off and they say hey you know what you're currently a crate more pollution or using us at all creating as at all then you know the point is we don't need it anymore so why should the federal government and pose Fifteen Percent ethanol and feel\nAnd it's been a big push by the left all these years now because it was done for eight months a year to make it a twelve month issue that is the sale of eat Fifteen ethanol blend all year round not just for eight months\n\nWhile the Democrats didn't do this the Trump Administration did all three of these things\nAll three of these things\nFord Motor company which I guess we're supposed to hate now\nHas said that US Steel costs more than anywhere else in the world they're spending an extra one billion dollars on manufacturing automobiles and you can see right now automobile sales are flat for new automobile because the prices are going up several thousands of dollars\n\nSo millions and millions of people are affected by that and they don't even know it same with refrigerators same with washers and dryers same with dishwashers\n\nSame with anything that as steel or for that matter lumina the prices are going up and that has a pressure on what inflation and you can start seeing inflation going up and interest rates going up\n\nI support the American worker I support the American consumer I support the American economy America First means capitalism first\n\nPark I don't believe in free free markets pure free markets well nobody does because we don't have them and we've never had them but that doesn't mean you embrace these Bernie Sanders ... that's what the drugs\n\nThe president's put out a dictate it's not even legal\n\nHe's put out a dictate through the department of ah what do they call health and Human Services [noise] they want price transparency I don't have a problem with that\n\nDon't want to price transparency but when they do the price transparency on pharmaceuticals here's what they need to do the same thing at the gas tank when you go there and they they show you are the prices in all show us the taxes show us the cost show us they are indeed\nWent into that particular medicine not what you want transparency thinking about all you must have transparency that's involved\n\nYou see the amount of money that's being spent you can read in the newspaper all the time to find various cure for cancer you see the amount of money that's being spent did find cures for dementia and Alzheimer's the amount of money that's being spent to try and find cures for diabetes and so what money's being spent over and over again and really\nIn many ways or at least in some ways it's been quite beneficial people live longer than ever before\n\nYou know the government tried to regulate the cost of vaccines under Clinton in other administrations you know what happened we had one vaccine company left and they couldn't make enough vaccines and then they at a hospital so we import vaccine from Europe and other places\nWhen the government gets involved prices go up\nDemand goes up quality goes down availability goes down this is a matter of fact\nIt's not a matter of conservatism liberalism socialism capitalism is they say it is experience it's provable\n\nSo now we're driving up the cost of consumer goods big consumer goods I'll give you another one and somebody you want like those either because you know you're suspending your rationality and it's just a you're waving the flag a of a one party or another I don't care\nHas support this president\nDoesn't mean I agree with everything I don't agree with what he's doing in these areas are winning bring 'em up\nThe tax cuts\nNew home sales are flat and starting to decline it's starting to happen with re sales now why is that well the media will tell you mostly\nThat it's because of increasing interest rates low interest rates are increasing but ladies and gentleman they're nowhere near high interest rates four percent four and a half percent many of us have lived through eleven twelve Twenty one percent interest rates this is nothing historically it's minimal\nThat's not why why do you know why Mr producer\nBecause you can't that Dr all of your interest payments on mortgages and all your property taxes anymore is it ten thousand dollar threshold and it's doing exactly what I said it would do\n\nIf you can show there's some kind of antitrust violation or something like that go for it but that's not what we're talking about here\n\nWhite House decides it's too much now go in there and pull down the price of [noise]\nI mean that would be saying things seem to develop or you're charging too much for your condos you're charging too much for office space you're charging too much for this that or the other wires certain industries untouchable and other industries are endlessly touchable why is that\n\nI told you yesterday that the media are a joke the every horrifically comparing the president to Hitler is terms the Hitler because he says I'm a nationalist and it is outrageous that they use such rhetoric is grotesque but also\nI pointed out yesterday\nThat the men who made this nationalism fame famous and the last century was Theodore Roosevelt progressive\nAnd he gave this famous speech called the new nationalism speech and they talked about all the things big centralized government was going to do and that's when I said to the president at least on the air you don't want to be that\nWe're not talking about national as we're talking about American is when\nYou say America First you're not saying nationalism first\nWe believe in federalism\nNow I Know what the president meant you know what the president meant for the last that was just another opportunity to be the same the president and the dumb down what Hitler did get sick\n\nBut words that meaning they've consequence\n\nYou listening to your not nationalist nationalist you believe in big centralized government the national government at all times these of either state governments are local governments that's not what you believe it's not nationalism versus globalism it's constitutional is\nVersus globalism it's capitalism that we embrace constitutional as individual is\nJust what a fine point on it\nThere's no reason

Trump\nCats are served as deputy White House counsel before Trump tapped him for the powerful D.C court of appeals last year [noise]\nGoes on a spokesman for Mueller's office Peter car declined to comment on my litigation\nLawyers for Trump said the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit at nothing to do with the president know ideas said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger shown said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mile a subpoena beyond Miller Miller's Laura's agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month the asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses in the mail or investigation also said they were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district court or steal\nThe DC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later\n[noise] stay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone found a motion to quash or otherwise resisted the grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted ... who I Know hey Gibson Dunn and crunch or attorney who has handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nTrying clear what is the case the appeals court has agreed to hear and December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege it's framed as a broader attack on my list that's already or perhaps advances both sets of arguments\nIt's very hard to tell from the stock of well I'll tell you\nIt's not hard to tell at all\n[noise] Mr Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler under the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making and professor ... has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument\nProbably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation in the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again not because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\n[noise] the grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of us has already legal legitimacy before a judge is relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here\nSuch questions have also been raised by defendants and some of those criminal cases but all the human defendants who set foot in a courtroom of ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel's what part of your tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts involving grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America our chief he lie singles fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\nThis can't this can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry butler recalled a case from a previous investigation we couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because it was under steal art\n\nI'm fairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller\nBy counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler on the appointments claws and have the DC circuit has been packed a leftist an Obama appointee so\nWho knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also that take it to the United States Supreme court and despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst and others this is not the Martian versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and loving the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calibrate says opinion respecting Muller and this is why these two questions are important to stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\nFor is he an inferior officer for purposes of a challenge to the appointments clause of the constitution\nAny signs of partition in favor of boycotting Israel he signed a petition in favor of moving police officers outta prisons and more than that as you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were

they're either turned over to the set who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not being deported isn't that basically his position\nYeah I asked him on Sunday nights they will you on\nA big painter equipped with Kobe caters when the federal government wants to make a criminal illegals coming out of course when will you want it became a request from Donald Trump's ice agents say he would not uh said he would do that and so if\nHe could have said oh I don't want criminals on the shape of the fact that moderates he quite not to cooperate with right I Will say that all he wants to do is move with under the Justice Department mark you know about them trying to backtrack buffets condition you know what he was
