J. you know in West Palm Beach in mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and always in and honoring the pleasure to be filling in for the great one more call then by the way you cannot catch me on Twitter at Brian ... radio\nNow here's an excerpt from the president's base\nThroughout the year we've seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know what do you take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives\nCalled Medicare for all the Democratic proposal would establish a government run single payer health care system better when the dates all private employer based health care plans it would cost an astonishing thirty two point six trillion\nDuring its first ten years\nOh by the way as a candidate\nI promise that we would protect coverage for patients with preexisting conditions and create new health care insurance options that will lower premiums I've kept that promise and we're now seeing health insurance premiums coming down\nI've also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare that's why I'm fighting so hard against the Democrats plan that would of vista right Medicare\nDemocrats had already harm seniors by slashing Medicare by more than eight hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obamacare likewise Democrats would cut Medicare what their plan government takeover of American healthcare end of the extra there for the president let me\nPut something and and very clear terms\nThe president could not be more right\nThe omission and the media on this one beyond the USA Today piece is pretty incredible\nBut what the president is doing here\nIs an education that you can even get in school right now it's so important the greatest fraud the greatest fraud that has ever been perpetuated and accepted\nAs the legitimate concept by millions of American is Medicare for all\nTalking about the sliding scale morality and how you have many politicians all political party anymore that starts out with an amoral base and it will take you if you line up with them to an amoral place immediately because it's a false premise it's based on\nMedicare for all its financial broad what the president was pointing out there the eight hundred billion over ten years that's diverted\nHere is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent white it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of points\nReal quickly and here's the first one [noise]\nIf we already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal according to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in year one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare plan\nAnd it gets worse every year from there\nCurrently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that that you got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\n[noise] I mean it is financial thought is bigger than Bernie Madoff you as a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we've got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nAnd by the way\nYou're not paying attention to board has given the joy of race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist once\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this thing I just it was the Trump candidate who is running as a Republican toy place Rick Scott\nWho was term limited and running for the Senate Andrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians though I Know you won't have the most liberal in less just governor and the entire country\nIf Andrew Gillum wins and you go well that sucks to be a win for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham who had been the daughter of former governor Bob Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode a wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination which is thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is\nThey now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with us money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check so year Michael Bloomberg felt like he said that the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this ... is critical and again there is one platform piece of particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way it's all that much more ironic what you're talking about governor trace because we'll Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter\nAndrew Gillum has also run on um peachy President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here now this is why it's important to educate\nIs why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years\nAnd benefits will be cut and you've only got fifty percent on it\nIt is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's going to get better there is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is the one of the biggest challenges we got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way it also happens to be financially illiterate\nBut even then what percentage of people earned\nMinimum wage yeah number in your head\nHow many people back in twenty fourteen you think earned minimum wage ready one point eight percent even and brought to Obama's a God I mean it was only one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and a half but it'd be working part time\nJob I mean you know the the people that were heads of households\nOr you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage\nRight but that was them and we got the best economy and a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate and forty nine years we got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much what he white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage you're ready\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics point six percent\nPoint six percent that zero zero point six percent now what's more is that Ninety nine percent of those people be point six percent are under the age of twenty five\nAnd what happened as soon as Amazon raise those wages we add the minimum wage conversation come up again\nAh one of the great fraud perpetuated that's out there is still living wage it's funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com props prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages\nJust like what we're seeing because here's another little factoids oh by the way\nWe take a look at the average amount of money that a person can not only are we finally\nJust about a three percent towards a wage were by the time you add in bonuses goes over that by the time you add in your tax cut churns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year because what\nThe average Jeanette take home pay now up six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good [noise]\nFunny what happens when you actually have a good economy a living wage\nIt's just a bunch of BS\nSuicides histories one side of the facts won't get getting used to do a lot more\nActual ... white here I Am Brian ... in the gray one Marshall ...\nEvery time you go on line your

interesting because they're on a number of different comparisons you could actually make between that midterm cycle in bits one but are they talking about some of the\nMisinformation out there the fraud that is Medicare for all talked about how much more money we're really making that take home pay up six point seven percent year over year\nAnd then you get into this recent study that was really just mind numbing\nIt's why we have the broad being perpetuated that is Medicare for all survey Republicans believe us economic system is fair to most Americans Democrats don't came out earlier

individuals in this country actually bean ... than most Democrats feel the euro us economic system isn't fair [noise]\nDoes gets back to what I pointed out earlier this hour sixty percent of adults being financially illiterate\nAnd then somewhere along the way it's like oh crap\nOh that's not working out so then it became what in the eighties or nineties you'll remember what it was remember now every aerosol can every little puff of that hairspray for that big eighties here that was another chunk out ozone layer oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere on the way are like oh you know what the sun actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually dedicated the entire effort in this world towards eliminating that we probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those are holes [laughter]\nFunny thing I sunspots you know [noise] [noise] so that went away and then what did it become well is global warming oh he got global warming for many years trying and then ...\nNot buying it [noise] so do from global cooling where you go from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel is something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been

has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way\nAh I'm Brian mud informed more clip and by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but but nothing of of significance here but for the folks\nIn the panhandle what

another source of political unity for the United states which is a a complete contempt I mean total contempt then is shared\nBy Americans are black and white and Latino and Asian and rich and poor and living in the interior live on the coasts everybody shares can him for political correctness\nThis is something that is stunning and there is a new study that a ... over at Harvard has written about yes Harvard we'll we'll get to that in just a moment and uh there's something else that uh I I think should unite Americans\nBut maybe doesn't yet which is a fear of another impeachment crisis I mean Democrats are being more and more serious and more and more\nCredible saying if we win the house of representatives let alone the Senate\nWe're going forward with impeaching Brett Kavanaugh we're going forward with impeaching President Trump\nIs that a good idea will talk to one of the people who was central to the last impeachment\nCrisis we had his name as a judge Ken Starr\nHe was in charge of the investigation that led to the impeachment\nOf Bill Clinton\nWhat are the lessons for today's political world and one of the lessons for Robert Mueller who's playing the same kind of job that uh that\nThat Ken Starr function in back in the Nineteen nineties one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nOn this issue of political correctness first and there's this amazing piece in or the Atlantic of all places in the Atlantic is not a conservative journal headline Americans strongly disliked dislike PC culture\nAnd this is stunning in the way that it\nShows that hatred for contempt for resistance to political correctness brings together everybody\n[noise] he um [noise]\n... what what they write about is this is if you look at what Americans have to say on issues such as immigration the extent of white privilege\nAnd the prevalence of sexual harassment there distinct clusters that emerge progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberal politically disengaged moderates et cetera et cetera okay one of the things is fascinating here is people who are traditional conservatives\nFar outnumber those who say they're progressive activists by twenty five percent or conservative eight percent are progressive activists by contrast the two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute and exhausted majority their members share a sense of the\nTea with our polarized national conversation\nA willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints and a lack of voice in the national conversation\nI think that's exactly right and you can count me\nUh yeah I I mean I I Would probably be grouped together with a twenty five percent who are devoted conservatives they say traditional conservatives\nBut they're certainly elements sometimes you feel like part of an exhausted majority and then\nThey go on to write they say most members of this exhausted majority remember that's eighty percent of the public\nAnd then some dislike political correctness among the general population full eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country\nEven young people are uncomfortable with it\nIncluding Seventy four percent between the ages of twenty four and twenty nine\nAnd all those under twenty four Seventy nine percent that means the people who most resent political correctness who think it's a problem in our country or the people are having it shut down their throats it's not working\nAnd why is this why is this resentments so common and by the way who what racial group represents political correctness most remembered to eighty percent of everybody you think why people\nWe're on the uh\nRacial group that most resents political correctness has American Indians\nAre second or Hispanics Hispanics hate political correctness and agents may harried dumb political correctness or even more than white people do\nBlack people Seventy five percent resent political correctness think it's a problem the country and this piece in the Atlantic quotes a forty year old American indian and Oklahoma who participate in a focus group is part of this project and it's an interesting project\nBut uh this American indian again forty years old said it seems like every day you wake up something has changed do say Jew or Jewish\nIs it a black guy or African American you have to be on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense it's scary\nThree quarters of African Americans opposed political correctness this means that they're only four percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe that political correctness is a problem okay uniting blacks and whites and young and old\nCan we say no to political correctness\nAnd that goes for political correctness even in San Francisco oh this is an amazing story about someone named Steve on don't say Steven his name is Steve on S. T. V. O. N.\nHe is the new president of the San Francisco Unified School district and they've had a long standing tradition for the San Francisco Unified School district\nA tradition of I'm beginning each public meeting by saying the pledge of allegiance\nWell no more instead the first meeting that Steve on ... presided over as president of San Francisco Unified School district sounded like this\nThank you tonight we start this me to get out of the claim American writer and activist Maya Angelou who wants to when you learn teach when you get give [noise]\nSection ... is accessibility to information for public sex shouldn't be open the items approval of four minutes for September twenty ... twenty I seen you kind of a ... motion a second please Selma surgeon ...\nOkay and then they go forward in the meeting a no pledge of allegiance and instead of a a phony quote why do I say it's a funny quote\nThe Washington Post ... actually looked at this uh this quote that as allegedly from Maya Angelou the only source for believing that she ever said it\nWas that Oprah Winfrey a set at that Maya Angelou said it but there's no record that you have a road that are set it or anything like that and\nBy the way what does it mean when you learn teach when you get give 'em a I'm\nI'm not sure what that means okay here's the story of Steve on cause he's a young man he grew up in public housing he did very well in school he went to Williams College very exclusive high ranking liberal arts college in Massachusetts\nAnd um then he came back to San Francisco is involved in a number of social initiatives in terms of like through the school board is now the school board\nPresident but he said the um\nThe move dropping the pledge of allegiance and instead of calling Maya Angelou was not a demonstration in the vein of Colin Kaepernick another San Francisco bureau in quotes uh he says I was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nHe told the San Francisco ... chronicled the current current political climate was disappointing and the Trump Administration has quote been attacking our liberties\nOkay you can even say all kinds of things about the Trump Administration whereas in the Trump Administration been attacking liberties I hadn't heard that before what what liberties exactly as the Trump Administration attacked\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then he said I don't spend much time thinking about President Trump yeah I think that's probably true\nHe says although there is a requirement that schools conduct a pledge or similar activity there is no such requirement for school boards that was a statement from the district spokeswoman whose name is Lauren ... neck and no one in the audience of beer to mind\nDetermined that\nA a memorial and it's almost a hundred years old in ... Maryland\nIs unconstitutional why\nIs this one hundred year old memorial is to people who died in World War one no one is alive who fought in World War one\nBut\nSomehow this lawsuit is stayed alive they've been protesting this memorial for years and now on a divided court chief judge Roger Gregory\nUh well he actually dissented from the majority opinion he said nearly a century ago Maryland citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task directing a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these zeroes had so noble e achieved\nThe panel majority says their effort violates the constitution\nThe soldiers fought to defend I respectfully think otherwise\nIt is outrageous and one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case is not too far away from this monument and Maryland is Arlington National cemetery and if\nThis decision stands up it won't it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably a seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to\nHonor people from that community who died in World War one by creating a monument in their honor and putting it up with public subscriptions it was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now if this court decision stands the monument would have to be removed\nDestroyed or defaced to a race to cross this is outrageous and it's why\nThe judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick
