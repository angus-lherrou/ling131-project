our buddy Daniel Horwitz ingests Seventeen months illegal alien family units increased by nine hundred and sixty percent at the border nine hundred and sixty percent\nThere are a lot more than roughly fourteen thousand people seeking to invade our border he writes the American people are rightfully concerned about the brazen caravan quote unquote of invaders headed for our southern border and fully expect that it will\nBe stopped at all costs before it reaches our border not in our courtrooms however we must not lose sight of the likely eight hundred thousand strong quiet invasion at a less public level that is crossing our border this year\n\nBrand new data from customs and border protection should mobilized Trump and Republicans cannot just focus on the caravan baton finally stopping the broader invasion in its entirety\nAccording to customs and border protection that she be P roughly four hundred thousand illegals were caught sneaking in between our point of entry in fiscal year twenty Eighteen and it's not even over\nAnother roughly one hundred and twenty five thousand presenting themselves at the port of entry into ... twenty Eighteen were deemed in admissible that fact\nThat the overall numbers increase by one hundred and six thousand ... twenty Seventeen is enough of a concern but several other data points or even more concerning that trajectory and the nature of the border crossings or what should really worry us\nFirst it's important to remember that border agents will tell you that the u._s. typically apprehend only about fifty percent of those who are legally cross the border\nThat means that they were likely close to eight hundred thousand people who cross the border last year not at our points of entry\nNow as such it's not just the several hundred thousand illegals that were released into our population after being apprehended that you're concerned those who care about their communities in schools what's more concerning or the people we never apprehend who most likely are more dangerous than the ones we did apprehend\nAs Brandon Judd president of the border patrol council explain a several months ago to or watch\nThe criminal cartels are pushing them but as these family units in front\nAs the sacrificial lambs forcing me to use my resources to take them in the custody so that they can cross the dangerous criminals right behind them and we play into their hands by continuing to humanize the way things are happening on the border\nTo more than humanize we romanticize ladies and gentlemen\nSuggest from a drug crisis standpoint\nThe hundreds of thousands of undetected illegals coming in every year thanks to the fake sympathy over families is terrifying as the LA Times wrote in a recent report\nQuote Chinese companies since ... no in small quantities to dealers in the United states or Canada but ship the drugs in bulk to criminal cartels in Mexico\nWell then what happens the cartels and mix the synthetic into heroin and other substances are press them in the counterfeit pills the product has been smuggled across the border see the Chinese government working with Mexican cartels\n[noise] the president is signing a series of opioid pills today all of which fell to recognize this premise as the main cause of the Seventy two thousand annual deaths\nThe next day to point that should concern us as the trajectory of the increase\nWhich is unfathomable while the overall numbers aren't higher than they were during Obama that is because the numbers dropped play once in a generation low during the first few months of Trump's presidency just based on the perception that he didn't force our sovereignty since a legal saw that nothing changed\nTheir numbers surge beyond belief and the president has been trying over and over again he's been telling us he wants to make changes but the Democrats in Congress are blocking it\nAnd so are some Republicans by the way\nA total of sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight family units these are ... nuclear families were caught between the point of entry in September a new record and he's sharp spike from the previous months in total one hundred sixty one thousand and I love and one hundred and Thirteen family units were\nApprehended this year remember only one point four percent of the family units apprehended last year were deported so much all of them remain in our communities along with the nearly half a million others who are never apprehended and this is growing every year so now we've gotten to almost seven hundred thousand\n[noise] and it goes on\nThis is an incredibly serious matter of course national sovereignty the rule of law or the nature of our immigration system it's being openly and brazen Lee violated and not just by aliens\nBy people in our own country by people in our own country\nNow we spend a lot of time last night it's been picked up by a lot of news outlets a conservative news outlets today as we have in the past on this issue pointing out the hypocrisy of the Democrats Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton Brock Obama\nBernie Sanders Chuck Schumer and many others Harry Reid\nThe positions that they took ten years ago Fifteen Years ago twenty five years ago the positions that they took all the legal immigration first of all they called them illegal immigrants\nAs recently as two thousand nine twenty ten Chuck Schumer called them illegal immigrants as a matter of fact he admonished his audience in two thousand nine he said look\nIf you don't use the word illegal then you lose essentially the moral high ground what is this on documented stuff he said now of course he's reversed course 'cause they're all about power in politics not about country\nSo what's the point the point is the Democratic party is not even the Democratic party of ten years ago it's certainly not the Democratic party Twenty years ago\nHis position on immigration like its position on economics like its position in the military like its position on healthcare embraces increasingly radical policies in attitudes\nAnd it's not going to get any better it's going to get worse\nBecause the media really want to understand the division in this country they need only look at themselves and look at the course of the Democratic party has taken you've a party where John Kennedy couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party where Bill Clinton couldn't be nominated for the presidency today\nGive a party that wouldn't nominate Harry Truman for the presidency today and I could go down the list\nAnd so now you've individuals who won out radical\nEach other\nTell me who is a centrist and the Democrat leadership boy so called modern can you name on his name on\nWell I Can't name any I don't see 'em do you\nAll right by the way we have a wonderful guest at the bottom of the hour I told you each night now we'll have one or two candidates on here um there are many who are deserving of support and you know who they are but ah doesn't work that way on radio this can't be a ... candidates\nLet's go to Billy Los Angeles California eight Seventy the answer K.

[noise]\nYeah and I you know I come from a very democratic family I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania where by family recall minors and ah the Democratic party really looked out for the working class they don't anymore if the Democrats are just completely gone so far left that they don't care about the the working class in the in\nIn America anymore and you know the biggest thing that bugs me I'll walk the walk but I think the biggest thing that could be done is it's both sides it's it's if if you really enforced even a fire\nHave always got the press and the media\nControlled and on their side so when they make media accuses Toronto being a dictator and seeing the Hitler and all this stuff I don't think it really applies because he's gone after the big media\nAnd so this is totally actually auction paradoxical or whatever you want to say\nI don't know but this is a very interesting point to your point with me then block Obama would be an and his relationship with the media will be more I can do what they accuse Trump and his relationship with the media to be\nThank you sir and another just another example a leftist sinister production and the one more quick point sir go word\nIn Latin

of topics and points you make it our our ... ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we and the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\nIt just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they call them they know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria should ban and all these regions that are going to war\nAnd uh [noise] we have the need of that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the you which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they'll get paid in what's going on mhm and I find very interesting and I don't know if I can share it on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um [noise]\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this or to the extent the progressive movement a reaches to its philosopher kings in Europe Russo and Hagel and marks and NGOs among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and in others but also of course hairstyle on says real but but the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good to the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and obstructions\nIn which I'm a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society\nAnd to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed doesn't view it that way conformity in uniform me that's not the priority as much liberty for an individual but as possible and in order to society and moral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is eight and a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and they will that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration [noise]\nBut you have a political party leadership in a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution it's the people in this country who have rights\nAnd welcome to the dentist for your show coming to you today from yet another city as I continue going around the country\nMuch of the of the six weeks I Am\nFamiliar with is a major event in Dallas for\nCase sky my local station here in Dallas it's sold out for the best of my knowledge but [noise]\nWho knows if they're up to a last minute tickets [noise]\nWell every body of the the big news and it took to the extent that I actually turned the news off this morning in my hotel room is of course about various uh non functioning bombs that were\nFound at the uh mailboxes or whatever maternity has in in a box turtle to imagine a mail box up the Clinton or Obama or cirrhosis homes\n... mailboxes regular regular homes are regular people but nevertheless doesn't matter it's disgusting whatever it is it\nTo I have no idea who sent them or put them there an nor does anybody else\nIt wouldn't surprise me if the person who's on the right wouldn't surprise me if the person's on the left wouldn't surprise me if the person is just looking for attention as deranged nothing which surprised me and but uh the uh I ... my my real\nMature I say my real reaction all my reactions real for my primary reaction is that I don't think it's worthy of around the our coverage\n\nThere were things that I think that do\nAnd uh the uh their their screen before they get there they didn't even they don't even make them to the houses are in the case of these prominent people so it's not even like you say mailbox they were addressed is more accurate they addressed to these people\nAnd the uh the world to CNN made it to the CNN location\nSince there have been so many hoaxes of left is trying to show how bad writers shower I there there are listed on the Internet of all the famous swastikas and new shoes\nThat have been at universities and elsewhere which were actually put up by people on the left in order to blame the rights\nThat I have no idea what has happened ... I'm I'm not an all saying that that's what happened here I'm just saying that one\nHas no idea who did it ... whoever did it should be prosecuted to the or the higher extent of the law I look I have long argued that people who simply\nEmail death threats should be prosecuted and sent to prison\nBut this is a a death threat\nBut desperate to a president or is it is prosecutor bull but a death threat to to a regular civilian is not I I don't quite understand why are we we are obviously the president needs to be guarded more than anybody else there's no question about back with the president is a left or right\nBut\nWe are all created in God's image and infinitely valuable at a death threat to any any human being is a is simply vile and if you rearrange the word the letters of rile you get evil and I wonder if that's a coincidence I have no idea it might be a coincidence but it is what it is\nSo I I don't have any tolerance for this stuff I don't I don't think the vast majority of you do either\nBut I have to say are sheltering founded ... unbelievably on compelling television news to watch more and more people interviewed saying less and less so I don't blame the people being interviewed\nOr what I mean they say\nIt's the twenty four seven new cycle is an issue unless you have but you know vast amount of opinion which which of course they do sometimes in the guise of news which is a problem\n[noise] but uh\nOtherwise it in terms of news you know my feeling it's a it's largely a waste of time if if there's nothing important to be learned how about you know we all have limited time on earth she took her time bill your boy you know I felt that when I was a kid I actually wrote in high school\nAnd I found a paper recently appointed loser after finding it after all these years\nAnd I wrote\nWant to I Want to I was a junior in high school and said I Want to prove\nThe urge George Bernard shaw wrong who said if it's too bad youth is wasted on the young and by so I've I've known that anybody could die at any time and that even if you live long it's still\nA limited little blip\nOn the time a radar of life and so you got to know what used to time I mean I waste plenty of time believe me\nBut there are things that\nI at least I Know when I'm doing some of my hobbies are just a plain hearts or whatever it might be I Know I'm wasting time so to speak\nBut okay I live with that but you see the problem is when you watch news and you think you are not wasting time you think you are becoming better informed that that's what a raises the issue to me\nSo according to the let's see the wall street German or\nWall Street there what I'm saying to Germany [noise] 'cause I'm I'm looking it up while I'm doing it second caravan gathers in Guatemala's migrants try to avoid traffickers\nCharity work because she knew dynamic is migrants bad together to seek to avoid hiring human traffickers and find more safety in numbers of a dangerous track so they go I'd like to know shut has anybody asked the Democrats\nHave\nHas anybody asked Democrats\nWhat is your what do you suggest be done with the people on this caravan\nI I haven't seen anything on that we would love to I I I think people need to take a position on this\nLook folks if this caravan gets through then there'll be another one I guess a big chunk of Central America will simply moved to the United states because people will feel sorry for them I feel sorry for them I I give you my word I feel every bit as sorry as anybody on the left to the extent that the people on the left feel sorry for them and just don't want to use them\nAs future democratic voters\n[noise] but they have to be stopped if this doesn't make the case for the wall then nothing makes case a four of wall\nMean businesses exactly why you need it I don't I don't want to I don't want to put Americans in the position of pushing families back uh physically fighting with families\nIt's just not fair and then it it's not fair to this country it's not fair to these families it's not fair to a first and foremost these guards\nOur people representing us but they can't be allowed in but I Would I I really want to know what to what positions leading Democrats have taken\nLetterman lead in the next caravan and what about the next caravan was a very big deal about the second caravan\nSome today's Wall Street journal even as a caravan of thousands\nOf hindering migrants makes its way across southern Mexico and why Mexico ... such a small\nOr border why don't we why don't we work with to Mexico to build a wall that it's an avid is from during Porter\nThousands of him to another caravan it's forming in its wake thousands of them during migrants gathering the Guatemalan city near the border with her tourist Tuesday\n\nRemember it's a Honduras two countries over Guatemala is the country to the south did I say a border with on the wrist if I did I was mistaken I met with Guatemala\nThousands of hindering migrants gathering the Guatemalan sitting near the border with the ... Tuesday it's yesterday to prepare for a new caravan\nThat would follow in the footsteps of a larger group currently marching to the U.S Mexico border posing a fresh fresh challenge to Guatemala and Mexican authorities seeking to contain a surgeon mass migration\nAll they really they're seeking to quell the other Guatemalan to an extent our church on charities assisting migrants from activists say as many as twenty five hundred endurance who crossed into Guatemala in recent days have gathered in the city of chicken mullah\n[noise] near the border with Honduras but estimates of the size of the new group very widely from that number down to a few hundred\n\nThe migrants say they plan to head to see you adults to coon among the Guatemalan border town was overwhelmed by a larger group of migrants who rushed into Mexico over the weekend some five thousand migrants who were marching northward and Mexico southern Chiapas state\nBecause uh my first commitment has to be the troops otherwise is no reason to listen to me\nAnd uh so I I just don't know I Would like proof that Soros is funding these people it wouldn't surprise me in the least and yes Carlos is entirely right his

many years ago and I happened to set it in many years to you part of what makes some leftist tick\nIs they do not have an allegiance\nTo any identity beyond themselves and humanity whatever that means that leads to humanity doesn't really mean much but in any event that would be the the their relief agencies to themselves and to humanity\nTo no nation to know a religion and therefore they are very uncomfortable\nWith people who do have\nAn allegiance to a religion culture\nNationality they they essentially load them yesterday I read to you\nWant us up at the European Parliament they plaque that it's actually at the visitor's center at the European Parliament about how nationalism leads to evil and I did it at a lot of the show yesterday was on the antipathy to nationalism on the part of the left\nAnd how good nationalism is such a good thing bad nationalism is a bad bad everything is bad I mean there's there's nothing that can't be bad nothing religion can be bad or anything can be bad\nSo obviously we're talking about could nationalism yes cheesecake can certainly be bad not ... not tasteless\nBut bad for you\nThat was the question posed to me and my earphones from Los Angeles or by my\nEngineer triple gee when they Prager seven seven six and ... this is a a this is a real real issue my friends if this caravan issue is not addressed then essentially\nAnybody who does not
