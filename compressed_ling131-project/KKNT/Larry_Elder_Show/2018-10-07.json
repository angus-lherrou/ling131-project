the beginning of it but a lot of factors are racing this to an end point very quickly and much more quickly than I've ever seen\nIn our industry so type thing is a a an airliner it's what we call it the the whole electric airplanes are in that promises to bring down direct operating costs and future missions\nAnd then the other side of that is these like little helicopters and what both of these together is we're pulling the stuff that we've learned from the automotive industry in hybrids and electric high proportions and using that in airplanes to do sort of the same things where we're reducing the cops and the mission\nBut we're also doing it to make a mission that we couldn't do before so these\nAre little helicopters it might have a whole bunch of little rotors we we couldn't have gas engines with you that electric by propulsion and many different ways is allowing this\nLarge expansion into new field of aviation\nI signed a fascinating so I Would think that reducing

here on the ground [noise]\nIt's kinda funny um the F a a a has been\nConservative in the certification of autonomous like in polls and when you move to electrify propulsion that has to be baked into that I already so it's a little bit of a Trojan Horse or moving forward the automation of airplanes that I'm Talking you know relatively sophisticated automation because\nUh most airlines right now have the capability of flying from the thing is they take up too when they land by themselves so we're talking about automation is a point of airplanes making decisions on learning and stuff like that I find themselves and that was brought on by electrify propulsion as well\nI I Love the technology is exciting you can hear the personal connection that you have to he actually has a shit about it and

Americans we will get to that as well on the ... show but first\nI just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective is is people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season\nAnd actually I Want to thank Mark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job\nAnd are helping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is a a basically it's almost a month long um one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful\nThis one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York um and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family and began things but also because on this whole Kavanaugh matter\nI I was able to see a little bit of perspective and let me just tell you something that happened which I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue\nAnd a a an normally I talked to my friends I I was approached by a little kid\nAnd when I say a little kid and ten eleven years old\nAnd um [noise] it ... ... he asked that I'm not even sure who we watch it you know I was with the current regime a hundred people there and anyway so the kid comes up to me\nAnd he says I I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice at somebody a Thirty Years' ago\nWhite lines at a big deal and I had not yet seen\nThe story about the uh legit bar fight at one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale and then I later in the horrors of ice throwing\nAnd somehow it this is now reaching ... kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is a is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that\nIt's okay to throw ice\nOr not that it's okay to be under age in a bar find them cetera et cetera no one uh was damaged or charged or arrested in this a bar if they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay\nThis whole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and girls in campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing is powerfully helping Republicans\nAnd I believe for one very simple reason if you like everything we've gone through with Kevin on four in the back in the forests in the punching and the pushing and the nastiness and then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm a Kavanaugh was not\nArrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up the bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw ice\nAnd a ... again I think it's more relevant to the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement I mean it was anything is more relevant than the idea that Brett Kavanaugh and money was at Yale\nI'm I\nWas a member of a hard drinking fraternity ... the whole idea that this is significant and that is worthy of our attention this is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail of people's task to try to smear them and destroying them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat then sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you will get in fact a Gerald nab blur\nThe radical from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and\nHe's already talked about impeaching justice Kavanaugh after he is confirmed if you think that's where politics should go\nAnd then first of all tell me why\nSecondly if you are almost sure to vote Democrat anyway if you do want to change your view on politics that is a little bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more\nAbout results rather than just destroying the enemy and results for the American people more days where the stock market is is a more days where people are working where people get raises I mean across the board\nIt's happening now\nAnd ah and meanwhile what what's the focus\nOf the focus is on on President Trump not mocking but daring to question a Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd he did it at a rally last night and President Trump is on button and rallies and do this wasn't a speech but first full of people say well he imitate it or he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony here was the president of the United states and what he had to say Hi\n[noise] right [noise]\nWell do you think it was I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where it was so I don't remember how many don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know\nI don't know what I that's the only [noise]\n\nAnd I'm at a map lives shattered\nOkay um [noise] look at\n... is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do it didn't do it but isn't it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question judge Kavanaugh\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the I'm Sarah Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this is the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about Christine Blasey Ford and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders\nAnd the way they're so disrespectful of president I don't have a problem and Michael are you know if someone from media asking the president of the question that's why we have the media to ask the president of question but it's not the tough questions their manners and make just trip\nWith contempt and he started out that press conference by saying okay ah the first question was what a cab and I said look I'll take questions but we're here right now to talk of the\nYou know the trade deals are there any questions about the trade deal and he sort of an afterword I'm Talking about the trade deal then I'll take questions I've kept my next person resurrect what about cabinet extra what about camera or you I was just outrageous and and uh\nAnd it just bothers me let's treat the price of the United states with respect and dignity I mean he deserves it and I look I didn't always agree with with black Obama in fact I just read with most of the things he did\nBut every time I saw him I was always sure Mr President\nAnd it just isn't happening there\nAnd I and I think most Americans do and I'll ... I'll tell you another thing I I Do not think it's going to work for the Democrats this huge article and honestly it's like reading more and peace it goes on and on all the New York times\nCan you know there are times that they aren't ten thousand words I mean it's a lot of war is basically the theme is President Trump didn't make the money on his own he got all the money from daddy and secondly I'm both Trump's both father and son cheated on their taxes why first of all why do you think they decided to spring this right now\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... march thirteenth out that was a\nIt was ... I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing I had a couple impressions that made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on it the first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and saying you know with a hundred times you know friends episode re rod you know that you've already seen twenty times\nHow many times with the New York times run the story I I read I worked on the campaign they must won three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they ran one last year and now the running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of this movie before the shuttle point I made us look there are alleging tax fraud tax there is a difference a\nMichael between ... oh boy I'm ... which any good businessman on any good you know out of a household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of ... after you got the most amount there's a\n... a boy and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax fraud went a lot of these look I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things will just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last fifty years has been funded by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason they're campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump\nA release of tax reforms I advised Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do you do not really sure ... because if you think this report which were Thirteen or they they did Thirteen thousand words they don't even have you know a lot of the tax documents there's\nA man who has you know warehouses full of\n... tax document through all the businesses she's\nRunning through the ... and all this I mean I I just think it would be a Pandora's\nBox okay uh and and don't file your taxes in a Pandora's box Stephen Moore\nWho is a distinguished visiting fellow in the project for economic growth at the Heritage Foundation [noise] so what does this mean politically with a campaign coming up an intense finally get to that and more on them eventually\n[noise]\nStuck on the health care Mohler coaster [noise]\nPaying those high premiums\nDid\nNot knowing what's around the turn\nMe tell you and I found central health care choices that really affordable managed care health care sharing solution people like you had been tracking it for more than twenty five years members report steaming around five hundred dollars a month on their health care I mean\nPay for things they don't believe in [noise]\nThinking die roller coaster\nCall star star seven three four to find out how much you can save on your healthcare met his year coal star star seven three for messaging data rates may apply that star star Seventy three for\nAmerica's wounded warriors aren't coming home after serving on foreign shores knees brave men and women are returning to their families and communities and\nMany have wound you can see that many have loans you can see like post traumatic stress disorder now that these warriors are back home and they are ready to enter the civilian workforce to help\nWounded warrior project has developed in the warriors toward programming career counseling service that helps warriors and translate their military experience to the civilian workplace these extraordinary men and women are\nProven world class job skills and unique perspective on team or near the job is to ensure the ride more you find the right job\nWounded warrior projects works with employers to find just the right match\nWhen you hire a wounded warrior hire an intelligent talented committed new employee\nContact wounded warrior projecting I'd find W.
