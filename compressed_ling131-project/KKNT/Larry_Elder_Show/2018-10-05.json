confirmation loose for a while that's fine but are you going to be there to vote on it if it's Saturday\nYou know there's the Democrats control the media narrative and I got to thinking I asked this question on Sunday on the program\nThe Democrats take their lead from the media the media take the lead from the Democrats I Believe the media now\nLead the way and the Democrats follow it let me underscore that point to the back veterans can repeated that the media the way the Democrats fallen I'll give you an example is really precious little reporting on the fact\nThat despite all the demand for another FBI background investigation that Dr forwards allegations to provide no corroboration whatsoever no evidence whatsoever no witnesses whatsoever\nNone\nNo collaboration whatsoever no witnesses whatsoever\nNo evidence whatsoever they went back and they interviewed people\nAnd so they trashed the FBI report while they didn't interviewed Dr Ford there's nothing to ask Dr Ford and if they did interviewed Dr Ford\nReally then you would need a criminal investigation which this is not a for her to explain her inconsistencies and so forth and all these witnesses who she says she has or doesn't have would have to be interviewed in that context but they aren't\n[noise] so there's very little discussion about that that is the fact\nThat the FBI report found that\nThere is no

stories\nPerson to be on the Supreme Court\n[noise] the reason I think there's been a lot of pushback across the country or what took place in the Senate Judiciary committee in what's taking place in the media\nIs because not all Americans but most Americans have common sense most Americans are good people\nMost Americans know set up job when they see on\nThey saw the Senate Judiciary committee that apparently hates men that promotes lies and mob rule that plays dirty tricks that rejects fundamental due process rights\nThat declares that person guilty without justice without evidence without any\n\nAnd as I said yesterday the American people saw a federal judge a man with a stellar reputation\nBroke with tears\nIn front of the media in front of the nation in front of the world and they saw Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee relish ship relish the\nEnd they came to hate cabin all the way they've come to hate the president because he fought back because he spoke up\nBecause he challenged his accusers the Democrats and the radical left wing not base want you to believe that they represent women that they stand for women's rights not only do\nThey stand for left wing limit but they don't stand for women's rights\nIs there any single conservative woman\nBut they don't trash of course not\nYou're either with their ideology or you're against it this cycle it's an attack on old white men Nineteen Ninety One and was attack on a black African American by the name of Clarence Thomas\nRocco bombs\nIn a lecture didn't care about a woman they trashed Sarah ... they tried to destroy here they found that six complaints against her they attack the intelligence and on and on and on and don't stand for women\n\nThey don't stand for minorities\nListening for power they stand for progressive status and control\nAnd they turned citizen against citizen that's what they do\nWhether it's man against woman whether it's strained against gay when the rich against poor black against white so forth and so that's who they are that's what they do that's how the Democratic party\nExists that's how it was created they stand for women let me tell you a little secret doctor for doesn't stand for all women her\nLawyer doesn't stand for women yeah there was making accusations against Kavanaugh don't stand for all women they don't stand for the women I Know who stands for Mrs Kavanaugh who stands for me to Kevin orders\nNot the Democrats they could care less who could stand for Mrs Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh's mother\n\nNot the Democrats if you do not embrace the radical

want because obviously they wanted to graduate I watch the times they don't care about the client is what I'm saying because they want to think of course we all know to drag it out but they don't care about the victim is what I was getting at\nWe know what they want they don't want this they don't have an hour which ones so happy for him but I'm so happy for what's going on but I mean I Am just discuss it that we know they don't want Kavanaugh but for them to stay one justice for the victim because at the at the track this out\nNow that the the the way as if you want justice for the victim you go into the Montgomery County police department and you make a complaint and see where that goes and they won't\nBut already I'm Jay I Do get your point I Hope you feel well a given your week hard

your partner in crime Sean Hannity I don't know what we would do without you know you kind of touched on what I was going to bring up\nAnd maybe I Need a little more my understanding common sense would dictate that they don't need the FBI does not need to talk to the judge or Dr Ford or why not for the sake of appearing\nTo ensure not about appearances they had a limited amount of time listen\nAppearance is not is not going to assuage the left it's just not and so we on the right we have to start to understand there so we constitutional is it's not about I'm a pass to find the media pacify the Democrats don't you understand they want to destroy what we believe in\nYes and so we can do twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\nThis these are the same people who said the man is guilty it's a job interview and that in the ... and and that the uh\nThe the due process doesn't apply because it's a job interview does

I haven't read it yet\nI Want to read it to you\nI was deeply honored to stand at the White House July nine with my wife actually in my daughter's Margaret in lies\nTo accept President Trump's nomination to succeed my former boss and mentor Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court [noise] my mom Martha one of the first woman to serve as a Marilyn prosecutor and trial judge my inspiration to become a lawyer sat in the audience with my dad had\nThat night I told the American people who I Am and what I Believe I talked about my ... year career as a lawyer almost all of which has been in public service I talked about my twelve years as a judge on the U.S circuit court of appeals for the district of Columbia circuit\nCalled the second most important cart\nCourt in the country my five years of service in the White House President George W. Bush talked about my long record of advancing and promoting women including has a judge majority my forty eight law clerks have been women and as a longtime coach of girls basketball teams\n\nAs I explained that night a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial arbiters who favors no political party led again our policy\nAs Justice Kennedy stated judges do not make decisions to reach a preferred result judges make decisions because the law in the constitution compel the result\nOver the past twelve years I ruled sometimes for the prosecution sometimes for criminal defendants sometimes for workers and sometimes for businesses sometimes for environmentalists and sometimes for coal miners in each case\nI follow the law I Do not decide cases based on personal our policy preferences I'm not a ... for pro defended judge I'm not a pro prosecution of pro defense judge I Am a pro law judge\nAs Justice Kennedy showed us a judge must be independent not swayed by public pressure or independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the separation of powers for their rights and liberties guaranteed by the constitution\nThe Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution\nThe justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle they do not caucus in separate rooms so I've said repeatedly if confirmed to the court I Would be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and laws of the United states I Would always strive to be a team player\nNow during the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes a vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters of face vile and violent threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement in response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement and the answer is also reflected my deep distress and the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\n[noise]\nI was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been\nI might have been too emotional at times I'd rather my tone was sharp and I said a few things they should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son has been in that I testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge a person I've been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent a dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues in litigants would the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed and will continue to be the same kind of judge I been for the last twelve years and I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach volunteer and teacher\nEvery day I Will try to be the best husband dead and friend I can be I Will remain optimistic on the sunrise side of them out and I will continue to see the day that it's coming not the day that has gone\nI revere that constitution I Believe that an independent and impartial judicious raised a central direct constitutional republic if confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court I Will keep an open mind and every case and always strive to preserve the constitution of the United states and the American rule of law\nBrett Kavanaugh to beautiful up it won't matter one way to the Democrats or the media\nAnd the three Republican stooges are really wanting their own careers and positioning themselves and don't give a wet about judge Kavanaugh his wife his kid George parents\n[noise]\nPlus several times to judge mentions in this op ed the constitution and therein lies his problem\nThe reason he's hated by the less the reason is under attack by the Democrats [noise] the reason the media went with gossip and rumor and really defamation each because his declared support for the constitution they do not support it\nThey do not support the constitution except protect the free press part because they take it protects them\n[noise] but when it comes to the constitution they trash constitutional originalists and ... were throwback stops you know unless we embrace the progressive agenda and and trying it\nAs a constitutional matter there by rewriting the constitution was nearly five justices\nThan we injustice Kavanaugh must be destroyed it is the constitution that gets in the way the progressive agenda don't you say\nIt's the constitution that they despise\nThey make no sense whatsoever when they talk about the constitution when they talk about precedent when they talk about precedent we know I suppose that they must embrace Dred Scott ... plus it and they must embrace Korematsu that's precedent\nIt's precedent that was rejected as precedent the case so Dred Scott took a civil war to undo it the case of plus it took fifty eight years to undo it\nCase Korematsu it still hasn't been done those were activists\nJudges who did not follow the constitution of the United states\nThat's why this is an important debate\nThey insist on abortion is not in the constitution so they demand precedent they insist on their entire social agenda there are environmental agenda it's not in the constitution but they demand it they insisted on all powerful centralized government to advance their agenda\nTherefore the west in response to your question has nothing to fear for it for much atheist said nothing to fear from about Islam as long as it does an attack us has nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet the the ... the ... the the totalitarian the authoritarians a suppressor of free speech and liberty come from the left and we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should or Jews should sit idly by\nWhile the secular left destroys our
