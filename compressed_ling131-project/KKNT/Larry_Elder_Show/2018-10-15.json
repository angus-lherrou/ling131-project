comment\nAcross the table right before I ask you to come on it made me say hey man get over here\nAnd how would you joined me for segment and that was the comment that you made was they won't let you tell your story in schools right today this is a very dangerous time in America today I think you'll agree with me we're watching very harsh rhetoric come at us from the left threatening violence from what are\nWidely regarded as Democrat leaders we've heard them from Hillary Clinton she can't be civil with us\nWe've heard it from Eric Holder and oh I don't consider Eric Holder leader of the Democratic party I consider him a loud mouth opportunists who will do and say whatever he has to do to stay in front of a camera because he apparently has political aspirations but he says when we go low [noise]\nThey're supposed to kick us you've got a story to tell my kick is different explain that\nGod chooses the color of our skin and God she uses it for a man or woman and God chooses our parents or brothers or sisters and God chooses a nation we are born and [noise] and I don't judge judge choices that makes no sense to me [noise]\nAnd it takes the race card right off the table [noise] well they don't the liberals don't want to hear that sentence but just simple sense well they don't want to hear that sentence because it wakes up part of their agenda text got out of the equation takes\nThe race card off the table it takes a whole lot of things I Try and teach the kids just look at God's work just look at their work a perfect world is and where we are yeah look I'm amazing look how beautiful displays yes this is the most beautiful places in America and there's more loving the world and there is hey\nWhat you would never know that if you were just watching TV or if you were turning on the quote unquote news where if your head was buried in the quote unquote media and I've been teaching people for years to try to get their head out of this garbage and go out and live their lives and look around where they are and see what they see because guess what happens when you do that\nAll of a sudden you find out more people think like me and I'm told all day long [noise]\nIt's not as bad as being told all day long I really am mainstream\nIsn't that right that's what you need to understand [noise]\nYour purpose in your place in the world\nAnd if you can't see God's work who who look at yours well we'll look at your work nothing happens in this world by itself you know the political left will never pushed that way they are trying to terrorists down there trying to keep us from the news they want to destroy train them in America\nBecause [noise] socialism is their goal socialism has been part of their agenda they've been quiet about it this has been building for decades just could here's a lesson from Vietnam that they don't speak about\nThe great lesson from Vietnam was\nThe communists were supplying the north Vietnamese with everything they could to defeat us and they realized they couldn't beat America through our military\nCouldn't do it but they saw the weakness at home [noise]\nWe elected bimbos\nHas our leaders\nAnd they were the ones that lost that war wasn't my stolen what happens is now here's\nThe concept the communist learned that they need they could destroy America from within by supporting these idiots propaganda that we elect\nNow let me let me stop you for a second because you're going deep I can keep it for three hours but we have other believe me I\nIt's an honor to sit here and talk with you but the propaganda that we're talking about us what you're talking about they can beat us from within and they did it during the Vietnam War you know that first year and they're now that's where I Want to go which you know you're seeing that regenerate aren't you because the God\nThe United states has a covenant with God that people don't speak about and the covenant is we're supposed to be the greatest nation economically and militarily and spiritually\nSo powerful so strong\nThat our enemies with our in our shadow and the world would be a safer place well thank God for Donald Trump he's making us stronger\nWell you're not you watch Ninety two percent negative coverage and in today's day and age what again what do I get to see how how do we get to ... and my job I Believe my mission was to get to those many high schools as I couldn't speak to his many young people as I could to give them the basic\nHow great America really is how successful are you getting in those schools\nI've been doing it for Eighteen years now and in the beginning I got to ten to twelve thousand kids a year now I'm lucky to make a thousand why because the liberals have taken over our educational system [noise]\nThe liberals have taken over our colleges and universities are high schools we can't I Can't get into any so let me again there's always method to my madness where when I asked these questions you and you'll know road I'm going down I Know you will [noise]\nWe've known that liberals have been infiltrating our systems are our culture our our movies are films are just about everything music now Taylor Swift run in her mouth as far as I'm concerned\nJust shut up and play music and stop alienating half of America same thing with LeBron James Robert Deniro I Can't even watch good fellas anymore\nBecause of Robert Deniro so we've seen this coming what you were just talking about for quite some time it's my question is is Democrat Republican it's an honor to sit here and talk with a man who's been through what you went through in defense of this nation talking about losing friends of yours that twenty Twenty one years old what\nDemocrat what American wouldn't want you talking to our kids about what is part of our history I just want them to\nHere's my line to these kids after you explain what their freedom cost how children used in Vietnam [noise]\nGetting you have to explain the price of freedom then I my question to them as we are going to give your freedom to [noise] you can give it to drugs Alcohol Tobacco having a baby too young jail socialism whore you can keep it for yourself you and I would say that OK Now today but it's not are trying to explain to them\nIf he spent that\nTime and energy even helping kids [noise] instead of screaming that he's going to take our guns away [noise] work on and helping young people\nWorking in helping young people imagine that good he could do with tens and hundreds of millions of dollars that he's spending and trying to take away American Karate kid\nA healthy breakfast every morning and that kid got up and could go to school and\nSure and the bill of rights and\nHow great America's freedom is and how many people are living in good right good condition he could do far more good\nBut he is and you know at least he's on a path that he wants to take our jobs away of his mind I Can't say on the guy I make no bones about that every year I think yeah I I find the irony in Michael Bloomberg to be absolutely hilarious if it weren't so dangerous because of the money that he's capable of spending I use the analogy [noise]\nThis is a guy who wants to take away sugar sodas wants to keep eating bad foods right you're shaking your head and shoulders to actually control you know he's running as a Democrat he was a marriage is a Republican now he's an independent see this as a guy that has no convictions\nBut don't you find it ironic he stands up on the podium at the New York hotdog eating contest every year while he wants to take away oh you know things that causes obesity while he's introducing when he was married anyway well he's introducing folks are going to stop the shutdown sixty five hotdogs in ten minutes\nYou know the whole irony of this thing gets may end up with what's difficult it's a guy who go hits a typical rich guy who sings because he made so much money\nHe's so much smarter than everybody else all he did was smarter he was smart enough to make more money that will was well he up the guns that surround him when he was not never he won't give up anything this security I bet you his security it is out this far greater than most people\nHe's got an army at us out there and they can afford it\nBut he thinks because he sat smart Martin everybody we've had about ... to the left we've got out of malice either Democrat we've got about a minute Saudi Aramco the two armed American radio listeners and tell them why it's so important\nThat they stand up and be heard and fight for these rights carrier weapon and when you can carry it in an open area carried in an open area so that everybody can see\nDoes guns around and that's the bad guys can see you it's not about the good guys than you\nAnd it's about the bad guys seeing how many guns are out there and they got to rethink how they're going to be [noise]\nUm [noise] try on they're evil and that's the deal the guns in the way and it's supposed to be because good people need to carry them more and more good people\nMarked on maestro it was a real pleasure meeting you\nI was applying I'm Glad I had the opportunity God works in mysterious ways there was a reason you were across the table when we were going to the segment so I had planned on going directly to Mr got leaving opening this program but guess what

gun here is like a book\nThreatened by it and sell it among your friends you can carry it without much concern there is some prohibited places but they make sense give or take well you know\nBut there's crime that comes with that Allen and I'm surprised that Arizona right isn't the crime that come ...\nNo no no more than anywhere else you have criminals they operate in their criminal some ... and then there's the rest of us and\nWe will carry Arizona would still be the quote unquote wild was of course I'm being sarcastic no\nCriminals operate on the constitutional carry any way that is simply carry guns and it's illegal and sometimes it gets stop sometimes they don't they used to be an honest person carried a gun and got stopped oh my God this is bad and it ruins your life\nBut it's just possession of personal property and you bring up a very important point boy Lewis who's going to start going for a nationwide\nIs discrimination against civil rights based on firearms the banks are trying to close down companies trying to deal with firearms that's discrimination it's discrimination based on a civil rights\nYou can't do that and hotels to any argument is well the hotels are private place so we can do that\nYou can see this as private I don't let any blacks and I don't let engaged fat people women Jews that civil rights and civil rights are and in the constitution if you've noticed but firearms is right there it's an explicit express Sprite\nAnd banning it is illegal and this is a civil rights battles that we have to start operating on that way\nAnd something

Californians are abandoning that state because of the California policies and they're coming to Arizona where the property is better in the rights are better taxes are lower almost everything is better here except for the beach front we have a lot of beach no water and so they come here I Can't see it\nYeah it's all the way we're all the way over there right after the earthquake will have a beach front [noise] um so they come here and they bring their California ways and it is affecting the voting\nBody and it has the potential to change the legislature but Arizona is about as hard core pro America as there is in America\nTold me about the state level and I'm gonna move kind of quick 'cause we've got about three and a half for miniature state legislature here versus federal state legislatures pretty solid is it\nNot solid but it's not great some of the Republicans are kinda rhino and they're running as Republicans and they're not strong on our issues we managed to get most of

on your answer ought to do it anyway but I Want to segue over to the federal election as well\nWhere are we where are we here locally now here in Arizona we're in very good shape um we've got a few districts that to that lean Democrat and we're making some inroads into those districts [noise]\nBut uh as far as our state legislature they understand that gun voters are very important to them and we are are in good shape to get those people elected and ah I'm feeling good about the way our local elections aren't going here in Arizona\nAlthough I I lost a city council race by Lebanon votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it can be really heartbreaking to no question or no no it was much use the state and how you feel comfortable about to say\nI'm pretty comfortable about the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe that the governor is going to win again I I'm not a big fan of governor do seem but he's ... better than the alternative\nYou know if you would nobody was a big fan of a lotta people weren't big fans of Donald Trump but he was way way better than the alternative absolute I'm a big fan of Donald Trump loved it and call the

Miller in Georgia Zell Miller changed party he came to our side but\nHe can see after the Keating Five thing I think it was actually a penance that he had to pay to the Democratic party because he carried the water on the assault weapons bill\nAnd I believe that that that was why they said we'll let you off the hook on this Keating Five things but you have to quit this pro gun stuff and quit being a friend who DRA fascinated again there you go but right now what we've got [noise]\nAnd and here's the thing the cabinet bump up because Kavanaugh was eventually a confirmed\nThere are going to be a lot of people that said okay yeah we won that and sit back down in front of the on the couch and we can't have that you have to stay active you have to stay involved\nAnd so I think that the way to do that that what Mitch McConnell could do tomorrow to ensure that Kavanaugh bump lasts on through November the sex\nIs bring the sheer act to the floor of the Senate for a vote is everybody what it is it's been passed out of the house\nIt's sitting in the Senate to whatever committee but the sheer act is an omnibus out doors hunting fishing land access bill but it also includes the I'm hearing Protection Act\nIt also includes the a lawful purposes act which I think is critically important if you don't know about lawful purposes act you need to look it up that's that's a great bill and I\nJust got all over the years you know something else that you tell me if I'm a because you're right Mitch Mitch McConnell's not going to do that probably not he can he promised that they would they promised a lot of things you\nMay not be the biggest Republican problem is that they make promises that they don't keep and our guys say\nHell with them they don't do what they promised to do\nMitch McConnell could bring up concealed carry reciprocity if you want it to absolutely he could do it today and it would have the same effect as bringing up the sheer act it ... he couldn't move that over if I'm not mistaken could he not bring those two could you reconcile those two together actually\nTo I Believe I don't know from a vigil standpoint if I'm trying to remember whether that was incorporated into what was passed out of the house I don't think it was but and and even [noise]\nOne of the tactics when you get into inside baseball one of the things that I suggested was bring the national reciprocity act into the sheer act and then negotiated back away again\nSo that you get the sheer act because you say okay I'll tell you what will drop us how can you give us that and and then we can come back and get that again\nYou're talking procedural strategy too far above in D.C at this stage of the game you know why I and I said I mean obviously Mitch McConnell knows what he can do [noise]\nHere's the problem that we have right now you bring guns up right now the liberal heads are going to pop like that yes right now do go absolutely crazy and you know what that would do is more than likely I Believe Mitch McConnell might think this was just up there ... even more which could be\nObviously we'd be straddling a very fine line there obviously if you're going to do it I don't think conceal carry reciprocity would be the way to go they're going to come after that and not see gun bill but the ... is is absolutely brilliant idea a\nWho do you write who do you call let's tell people where to go to get that done at least ask\nYou need to call your your senators both of them call McConnell's off call McConnell's office um [noise] I used to know to to [noise]\nTo to say no I'm not going to do it I was the only way I can remember that here on live radio sitting at a table ... you're you're more of a patriot than I thought you were I I read it up to your PC you last year or just in an impromptu speech and rattle it often somebody checked me in the U.S I was right but\nI'm not going to take that chance right now but just look up a congressional switchboard right and you can ask for whoever you want to talk to at the congressional switch board\nAnd they will route you there and um [noise] that's that's worth doing send them an email they've all got their messaging apps you just look 'em up and and send them an email [noise] um but tell them we want to gun vote bring the gun vote it could help people like like a\nJon Tester in Montana and well if if test or decided well hey I've got to vote for this it could help him survive\nBut at the same time it would keep Chuck Schumer out of the majority leader spot has signed on to critical now we're talking about the ... the the incredibly fine tactical nuance that's involved here\n\n\nMy friends are here to be with you on this Friday maybe putting up with one of the most interesting which people help our time in my opinion of many of you will recall\nThat when Stephen Harper was the prime minister of Canada which she was a for nearly a decade between two thousand six twenty Fifteen [noise] I Wish I said to you I think the best leader in the world up this time or Stephen Harper Russia Bush\nWhen he was listening you smell is to make sure that what he was it I said that\nHe was in effect the Ronald Reagan of Canada\nAnd now I have him on the line to use his book is literally hours it published today or published this week right here right now and it is his thoughts on what was happening in the world today specifically\nFor dominance of Donald Trump the phenomena and indeed there Stephen Harper the phenomena of other leaders and the ignoring of a lot of their own citizens\nBut of course I Will let him explain what he's written and just say that it is an honor to have ... former prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper on the line welcome sir to buy show\nYeah thank you that thank you for your very kind words I I Do know that you said it was well it was an office that I appreciate hearing it now at person\nWell I'm Glad you knew it while you were in office that that means a lot to me [laughter]\nI by the way I just ... just before we START I I Love Canada I have been to nine of the ten provinces I've spoken to nine of the ten provinces by the way if you can arrange a speech for me I'm prince Edward island\nThen I can say all that much so [laughter]\nI Know we ... we will keep that in mind yes I Do have clout there [laughter] there are there are pretty limited opportunities there I Would bet yeah [laughter] right [laughter]\nExactly [laughter] pretty limited ... pretty key to to do that with the euro best or the other state written [noise] All right so tell us the thesis of your book\nSo that I wrote the book uh obviously you know from my background that spreads prime minister but in the context but who will buy no have I\nRun my own global consulting business in which I one of the country who died of clients around the world that vote or the cold weather can go on certain there and how to respond and prepare for that but also I'm chairman of the idea with the global federation of conservative party includes the applicant party the United states\nAnd a twenty sixteen I had been observing a obviously a theory of new and unorthodox than unexpected electro ... Donald Trump's election boat primary victories and general election victory was the big us but the upset ... Brecht referendum that were I was so called\nPopulist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what um how leaders business and political but particularly how conservative should respond to some of that so that it's really the topic\nAnd I get to put my feet that then the nutshell\nWith some people would find surprising I think the populace I'm as they wait these concerns about market than trade and immigration ... many of their concerns are correct\nAnd that but we do a better job in terms of policy we have to I mean who respond to be concerned but the way to respond to them through um you know good a good conservative response becomes or answered\nSo let me ask you the the mainstream maybe which of course is almost synonymous with a B washed around the world was picked all of these as sort of the nation ... almost fast\nThis ... in a battery and in Poland now Brazil and the United states what is your response to that\nWell any anybody who says that really clearly has no understanding of what fascism was\nUm you know the fascist movement which does exist and some corners in some dark circles or the movement from the central Nineteen twenties and I hit thirty one of the very differently than most of this right wing populism is not to say that in some\nCases there aren't a than some of the extreme there are some similarities but\nUm you know populism or people you see that on the lap I'm liberal media caught mainstream media I just call it liberal media that's what it is um [noise] you know frankly equate anything they disagree with with that that kind of a standard response\nBut populism has a long political tradition populous than on the right left and better and popular or people who\nRightly or wrongly are often trying to bring the concern of large map with the people concerned they believe are being ignored into public the public arena and um I think it's undeniable whether one agreed when that's where the concerns of\nAre the issues Mr ... rate on trade and immigration that matters like that there is no doubt that he is speaking for a large mass of people who are concerned about these policies\nAnd are you familiar I'm sure you are like just a quick take Hungary and Poland\nWhen I look I Try I'm not too I'm a kind of get into talking day to day politics of the various number of her but vi you\nUm I you know I Would say obviously in the case of Hungary 'em wet has heard of them support for Mr or bond more than anything that's been his ... there's been a ... to\n... I'm an irregular migration over his board or something that the population supports them on the right to support them on\nWho so he does it tell us a little I I was not familiar with this and I think the important for listeners to know about the idea of international Democrat union so tell us what one is that\nSo it was set up a believe it or not it was actually set up in Nineteen eighty three\nAre under the Reagan Administration um the regional vice president George W Bush with the spine or at the London Declaration that established the idea of prime minister about your cats are cold Germany a structure Iraq who I Believe was mayor of Paris at the time but the leader of the\nBetter right in France a day and a number of other leaders I think it was thirty five at the time came together to form a global federation of conservative party that has ... fairly regularly in the decades that followed it was very active and have some prominent near the end of the Cold War is the\nLeaders obviously coordinated their policies or you know researching conservatism coordinated their policies that were up ... successful and very short order and bringing down the Berlin Wall of the Soviet Empire but the organization has continued to exist then\nAnd by the court is really one way or conservative activists and operatives really share best practices on campaigning in on governing so\nWe just had a gathering of a hundred representatives of various parties around the world and and the Los Angeles recently actually\n... so I here here's something I Would love to get your take on\nWhen I think of Canada I I think of a tough to Canada is in many ways the same way I think of America to Americans Elect dinner right is to act is that a a valid perception or not so valid\nUm I probably would call with it and it's in that sense there's no doubt I'm there is no doubt that in Canada or a or I don't merit many Americans uh conceive of Canada's they have very left wing country I'm In fact\nConservative movement very strong candidate you mentioned upbringing ten years we had elections recently where and our two largest province of Ontario and Quebec or writers that are government came to office so we have a significant um conservatism and considerate moving in our country\nThat our country is far less polarized\nAnd kind of what you would call left right camps than the United states really are remarkably less polarized and part of the reason I wrote the book\nThe trends I talk about in the book the trend of\nYou know very poor economic outcomes for a lot of middle and working class people and the political disruption and populist movements we're now seeing they really have not hurting Canada the same degree\nSo my book is not about Canada in my book really is about ... from my perspective why some of the lessons and some of the practices we found in Canada a couple of boy some of the challenges and how they can help here the conservative movement in the United states and elsewhere for\nThe book ladies and gentlemen is right here right now I'm speaking to the former prime minister of Canada for ten years conservative no less\nAnd the book is up at the dentist Prager dot com right here right now and this man is as you could tell was obviously very thoughtful\nSo there is however and I are frequently rebates to national post\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago as a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained a fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately\nA lot of the day to day reporting and calling this are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics coverage I I Would not today consider the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of its day to day coverage in federal politics but at the editorial alliance lined remain relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage\nNowhere to hide it tough yeah you have to do a while yeah you have to you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will podcast\nUm you know I think there is a big market candidate for that kind of thing to take off as I said there is a\nYou know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom a kind of the ... the low number\nAnd so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing the\nWater by young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that ... not to the same right\nSo it was but but on the issues they differ is just as clearly as the left white differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued wow why isn't there that polarization\nI I think the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalizations about our country but it's a fact that\nCanadians having more civil public discourse and always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or heart or left liberal\nWould be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between party significantly bigger and Canada plots that I think the other factor\nThat often for God when people can it can ah when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two parties and that really changes the dynamic significantly I always say when you have a strictly to party you know he's Kennedy day and have a candidate B.\nHe can bring candidate B. down in a in a system where you got more than two party there's always a risk for the candidate a attack Kennedy be effectively the winter because Kennedy the blues\nNight oh about an hour I listen to this has been a great honor ... book is right here right now it is helping them as Prager dot com sink you prime minister [noise]\n\nThis is Dr Sebastian Gorka President Obama's views of leading from behind the level of the world in places\nFrom Russia's invasion of Ukraine to North Korea's missile tests and how to grow and I just kept\nOn the president's from American leadership is being restored\nBut that doesn't mean our enemies have this that's why I wrote my new book why we why\nFeeding America as enemies with no public\nAs a former deputy assistant to President Trump's strategy might explain the threat posed by enemies like Russia and China and the global jihadi movement we must know our enemies somehow so we'll see\nIn my book why we find all the political correctness lines of the Obama on ... and how we can bank wish long\nSebastian Gorka whose new book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies is available now from Amazon and Barnes and noble\nToday when you're trying
