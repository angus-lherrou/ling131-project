{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KKNT", "content": "When she was crying\n\nAnd\n[laughter] and they want to make money [noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nTalk [laughter]\nWell ah for for woman I'd like to do is I'd like to talk about what it'll do to the nuclear power plant which\nThe way folks is the safest\nEnergy we have out there we haven't built a nuclear power plant in the United states and the\nI guess the late seventies it was early eighties but it's been about Thirty years or so ... almost ... it's it's it's insane to me because it has been proven to be the safest energy source that we have out there and folks solar is not there yet do I do I have a problem with the idea\nOf solar energy no not at all\nBut one technology is not there and when they're going to try to shut down perfectly safe perfectly well working facilities worst thousands of people are employed where millions of dollars I think it's over sixty million dollars a year we get for our classrooms\nFrom uh these these these energy sources even try to shut them down and known to create solar power in order to do this we will have to create what was it they said they had to create here Andrew I Believe the great at least two factories which are going to be coal burning or fuel burning in order to create the solar right\nYep [laughter] rapidly and what kind of want to use on right now our plan this plant\nShoes natural neutral\nWell what do you think they'd be able to make it self sufficient sufficient in the way it would be able to use solar power up their uh their energy that that just tells you right there it's not as effective again the idea of solar is great but\nWhen it's costing more to greet more is creating more damage to our ecology\nThen it's actually helping is just ridiculous and here's the thing they said the fifty percent number\nThat's the big issue folks I don't mind that we move toward solar in some ways as long as it's\nAffordable and save and it it's a free market is you know growth spur a game for for for everybody either the citizens\nAnd or the companies that are doing I mean why would you do it why would you create something what would you put it out on the free market in last it was something was going to make money well unless you're subsidized um this is what's going on they're looking to subsidize one industry over another and\nIt's an estimate it's an estimate and this is the argument I'm hearing out there they're saying oh how can you say it's going to cost us an actress Nineteen hundred dollars that's just the number he pulled out of nowhere no that's a number where they've actually taken everything into consideration and it's an estimate that it\nProbably would based upon current growth curve numbers Kurt electric bills\nAnd what's going to get shut down and what's not going to get shut down who's going to lose jobs blah blah blah and the costs\nThat are associated with it you on average you vote yes on prop one twenty seven will have to spend an extra Nineteen hundred dollars a year on your on your bills on your electric so\nThat's just one way you wondering as you'd be saying no but to have you care care\nAbout the ecology care about your wallet in the air you breathe\nYou want to vote no it's as simple as that ... I I don't put this one it into\nA really good story line as well as I Do many other my or other problems that I talk about here Andrew and I think the reason is is because it's just it's a double hit of just insanity that they want to pass this\nI mean it's it's a very simple you know [laughter] it's a simple one does this vote no for\nMe to this one doesn't beat all the other ones out of the park just about the interstate why I'd be surprised\nTo\nCost talking California understanding similar\nPoint average and for twenty seven saying well we actually save money that's come we have an example California's right next to\nThis kind of play on their own apps three times what our last spring\nMicro spacecraft mission trying to talk of the opposite my\nFirst year after natural gas plants and other alternative on standby so far [laughter]\n\nRight and and and we're talking about cost here in regards to the nuclear power plant with some people may not realize unless you think about it is you can't run a nuclear power plant part-time he runs fulltime so if you need to it it becomes inefficient cost wise for the power plant to be running\nThat everything's secure to have everybody they're making sure that the temperatures are correct et cetera et cetera\nIf they can't use that power they're losing money they are just out now losing money and there are times a day where they're kilowatt hours in their money and everything is is is is more efficient or I should say more vision but less expensive for them or for other people to buy but when it comes down to is that all of\nThe they would they be working at a loss and no business wants to work in laws so what would happen he would shut down and it takes a long time to shut down something like that I don't know how long it takes to get a nuclear power plant back on line but I'm sure it's nothing simple\nUm it it's just easier talking ludicrous amount of of lost jobs\nAre lost a lost income for the state for our\nClassrooms and higher higher rates for years so I appreciate you coming and I'm putting out the fight here I've been running into a lot of no to prop one twenty seven folks quite a bit and I know we reached out today to have you on the air and it was fun to see one of your good warriors out their Lindy today who was a\nAt a meeting in Scottsdale and I ran into her to get a chance to talk because uh I knew she needed to spread the word so I appreciate all of you and all of your good fights and are are there any other propositions or you want to bring up to the folks because I Know that we aligned on all of them so\nI think when I got the word out there what is their crops like on that one\nOf those guys today [laughter]\nIt's a terrible idea because it ... times as folks that we

out like All right moving I focus you live and you can always find them on their homepage of our website there right there can't miss them the first question that we asked is where do you eat most frequently on airports and hear the results\nAirport club rooms forty percent of your formal restaurants at airports twenty two percent\nFast food and sports bars tied at Thirteen percent snapshot ten percent and vending machines ... percent so uh I guess there were probably club or am I\nJust think there's been an overall increase the number of people eating the lounges in the ... airlines everything\nHere faster than an average or our second traveled poll question when traveling what type of breakfast do you enjoy the most will get food the I'm running here clearly this week the results are hotel a restaurant or paid buffet thirty two percent of you club room Nineteen percent\nWe also have a tie here room service and free hotel breakfast Fifteen Percent donut our coffee shop eleven percent in fast food restaurant nine percent so quickly which we had ... pancake houses on their merit asked about I think I don't know for me I guess courtrooms probably most frequent\nI guess although I like a good sad good hotel yeah well let me turn around the house I don't like when you go what it's like forty nine dollars so now that are not great but again I can literally hold you through latch on the line well leaving you're saving money that way well that that's how I Know the new I Try to post coming up\nWe'll put those up by early next week so folks check out our immoral traveled dot com and you can check out the new polls and cast your vote fan as we move right along Mary where do you want to start off with some travel\nThat's all right well I think it's always a good thing when large companies get back to various philanthropic projects on on that now carnival corporation announced a series of community projects that will support children education at emergency preparedness in the Caribbean carnival of course has a huge cuisine presents and it is the world's most popular area for Cruz vacations\nSeveral of the carnival brands have been working with local and international non government organizations including UNICEF and United Way of Miami Dade and Puerto Rico and they are partnering with several of the island's hit the hardest and the twenty Seventeen hurricane season and some of the projects include rebuilding damaged schools\nAnd bringing back children's playgrounds ...\nPutting a they're they're putting their money back out there and the communities that are participating and nobody likes to talk a lot about Hoover and this week they received proposals from Wall street banks valuing the ride hailing company around a hundred and twenty billion\nAs they prepare for their IP oh an early twenty Nineteen that valuation Mary ... bigger than General Motors Ford and Chrysler combined and really what what also grab my attention they're competitor Lyft is launching a monthly subscription service\nAvailable across its user networking which users pay a flat fee of two hundred Ninety nine dollars they'll get thirty riots per month essentially lift subscribers\nOr can take up to thirty rides at a value of up to Fifteen dollars but if they go over that number or they're going to pay some more uh over that thirty minute window a and then in addition to rise beyond the thirty will come out of five percent is kind of\nInteresting I write well Jet Blue in the news this week by the end of twenty Twenty one Jet Blue said that it will retrofit a hundred and thirty eight Airbus a three twenty aircraft with for tax generators lots of architects generator well apparently it reduces noise on landings\nAnd believe it or not the entire retrofit will cost less than one million dollars so that's a good thing since twenty Fifteen Jet Blue has been taking new deliveries if Airbus a three twenties and a three twenty once with for a tax generators All right so now we know we all know what a vortex Jane now what that is now\nToo quick item landing too quick items from a a United Airlines first this week they boosted their profit outlook for the year as the U.S economy continues to home right along a and they're seeing big jumps and passenger traffic at their Chicago Denver and Houston Hobbs plus more business travelers are paying higher fees for those premiums\nBut they also make clear flyers who buy their cheap basic economy fares on United that they're going to continue to pay the carry on their backs despite moves by American delta who have relax their policy\nAnd then this last one for me to marry or Elizabeth I applaud for its honesty but perhaps not for its liability did you see this week that Nebraska tourism debuted new tagline for its new tourism campaign that since Nebraska\nHonestly not for everyone [laughter] Ali and I'm not making as I say there's yeah honestly you know they're attracting outdoor enthusiast state as they have so much natural beauty there and their new slogan is going to replace the one that dates back to twenty Fifteen Nebraska nice\nBut we really need to watch this because the purpose of the tourism department and they don't need me to tell them is that maybe they do if the cast as wide as bad as possible and attract as many visitors as possible so I'm not real sure about the success of Nebraska honestly it's not for everyone\nWho will Nebraska nice it's how well mindless Nebraska's fifteenth so that clearly that wasn't working that's that's the only three years old and they're taking all they can already see well hard hadn't got caught in the state\nSay our thoughts before we pause for a brief sponsor break and get ready for British writer and

a nutshell Giuseppe you've poured more than thirty five thousand cups of tea for strangers around the country give me the backstory to that what you're riding around in and serving your tea out of and why serving strangers free T is so important to you\nWhile you know I accidentally stumbled upon this power surgery and free T um\nI was one of those people in this country uh about forty percent of people in America a experience loneliness on a regular basis and what I found was that when I started having non monetary interactions where I actually just started simply sharing with people um that my basic human needs for you know ...\nLike my social and emotional basic needs are being met um\nThose being community genuine human interactions and things like that and so for the last Thirteen Years\nI've been traveling the country making the for free the last ten of those years has been an end to live with a free T bus which is a short school bus that's been converted into a mobile free T I was using a mostly salads materials running on recycled vegetable oil a solar power I'm actually a huddled up next to my woodstove right now making a ...\nSo so\nThen you see on the news I and you live at the end of Lou right\nI've lived in the end they will do for a little over ten years [noise]\nSo so what were you doing when the ... before you hit the road what were you doing and where\nI'm I was working fulltime in the video editor in Hollywood, California um when I first started serving T although I I had been either limited my pickup truck at that point for uh for about six months or so but I you know I thought it was in college basically before that was from college to develop I Believe them\nSo you pull up into a new city and started brewing tea and what sort of open the back of the back of your a mobile unit or put out a table and people walk by and say what a cup of tea is that it's that simple ...\nPretty much a free T signs I invite people in the inside of us really cozy warm woodwork space it feels like when people come in it's a lot of people take a deep breath and they say oh I feel like I'm home\nIdle time for your aunts\nMary Carey and radio networks

full\nCurrently earlier every year but in a few minutes we're going to take you to assign Halloween destination since that's the next holiday coming up in Salem, Massachusetts as that big day will be here and eleven days\nYou know Salem frankly I got it it it's an interesting place to visit if you haven't been there especially this time of year it's easy to get to I don't know about thirty forty five minutes or so north east of Boston so I guess married you want to go ahead do the rundown forever to and then we'll get ready to show ...\nFor our two of America's number one travel radio show

mentioned Halloween that's going to be here eleven days so we figured what better way to get all of you ready than a visit to Salem, Massachusetts so let's head to the show hotline and welcomed Giovanni I'll be so the president of failing historical tours\nHi Giovanni it's nice to connect with you we appreciate you saying a few minutes with us as we begin this hour show\nOh thank you so much it's very nice to connect with you\nGreat to have inherent so I think a lot of our audience listening today will connect to family Massachusetts all the way back to those iconic instruments which trials at sixteen Ninety two so I'd love to know Howard Salem preparing for Halloween and give us an idea of these sixteen Ninety two gallon witchcraft to walk that you offer\nSure um well balanced preparing and we prepare every year we get we at one point five million visitors a year and then during ah during the how Halloween falls on a Saturday in October we can have like a hundred and twenty five thousand people and I know I'm so we're always prepare it and try to make things\nBetter bring people in Atlanta as far as the trials all my God uh everybody comes here so funny way for Europe does it we execute twenty people what everybody comes here but we're glad they do we love telling them about it and ... story\nI'm sure that it has to be on the Salem historical tours and the haunted footstep goes to the love of the boat ah they're the oldest walking tours in Salem, Massachusetts\nFrom what we understand your tours they operate combo of history with a dose of those grim details in keeping with the Halloween being so for listeners around the country who might want to come to Salem at this point hoping to see your experience it goes what can you tell them that don't come away with [noise]\nUm you know we're a combination of a lot of things the witchcraft trials everybody knows about we're also fought in Massachusetts we are older than Boston we slow though is great stories in here so we were an\nIncredible seaport uh we had over ... ships\nGoing around the world during both Seventeen Ninety they have the eye and it's um\nThe wealth of the nation was here in Salem\nIn the early Eighteen hundreds we were the one that uh but it all comes crashing down due to various factors show um incredible revolutionary history as well and nice combo tours just kind of um we're going to take a call ghost stories with stuff for history\nI mean I was looking on your website and I saw gallery so no this is kind of people that have taken the to win or Arabs and goes I mean these are that's an awful lot of oddities on these tourists um have you ever seen a ghost or what you think might have been against\nOur absolutely definitely seeing a ghost I'm so\nWe ah well one of the house or the way the laws haunted house I'm In the city where the family had lived on those around the house not there anymore another house but I was telling a story and something went through a tree [noise]\nUm we've seen stuff in our office to we're on the old custom house oh custom houses were going to last so my daughter got\nStarted here when I found the voices behind her head a little freaked out but I slept in my own building because sometimes you know stay overnight waiting so I've never had anything happen that but I definitely have had stuff happen on my horse\nYou know I think that part of the country that you're in and for folks that haven't been to Salem, Massachusetts I mentioned a just a couple of minutes ago when we were\nAbout to introduce you that you know it's easy to get to I mean you're thirty forty five minutes I guess depending on the traffic from Boston northeastern right there on the coasts as you said and also this time of year I mean I guess the folks want to go about forty or forty five minutes south we've got plenty of so now you can kind of hidden all their\nUh you know I got a few questions right now for you and tell us do the tours Ron during all types of weather and how often do they run\nAnd do you and your team you know do you ever get that real fright or scare while you're out on the tourists [noise]\nOh yeah we're on every day I'm through November\nFourth here and then when daylight savings time happened and so we do the weekend but um yeah you know Boston sale employment combination is really a great combination people go to Boston and they take the train up here the train comes right through the city\nAnd its allies have the right to say on a couple of days here\nCould maybe go climate so it's really great combination I mean our area is rich and history you know one of the oldest part of the country so um but yeah so it's um\nIt's it's a great combination all around when\nPeople come here for the tourists uh what do you find is what surprises them the most when they leave that to you you're always going to chuckle about because you thought they would know where they just don't\nI think one of the biggest things that we are older than Boston and everyone doesn't realize that and then when we tell them about stuff like Alexander Graham Bell lived here for three years and uh we had a very\nFamous revolutionary I'll see a conflict I won't say battle that preceded Lexington and Concord is actually the confrontation a Revolutionary War\nA lot of like stuff like that that wall with them and then we call them all the stuff that oh my God people along the way we talk about and you know some of the little stories all the trials that are just so incredibly interesting that explains a lot\nOf those trials certainly in visiting if something folks the website it's Salem historical tours dot com Salem historical tours dot com Giovanni we appreciate your joining us today and good luck with the business and certainly Halloween coming up on the thirty first of\nAll thank you so much thank you for having me on\nGiovanni take care of a good that you tell\nMe All right Mary there goes Giovanni just released

America to go to a very good thing so that one with young children and and now a law degree\nFor young children and that was a triple a lot on\nThat one of the things that I Love that you write about in your article is that yes libraries of course are all about the box and other collections but she also reference some secrets in the actual buildings and downs particularly in the one that you describe I think it was the ... the library of St Paul is that where is that Switzerland\nConsider plenty of having a cold and go in and about an hour from now\nAnd what we tell our listeners maybe

was\nVery much and it was thought to return\nMommy the British Museum and we'd go into a ring around that right across the road from the British Museum and library to Mexico collection but I'm sure a lot of groups like either Holly and welcome collection\nLand for London was relatively easy\nI'm singling enough money in the middle of the law get some wonderful 'cause that was amazing code\nAnd I know there are a great day in this greatest nation on God's green earth a great nation despite the tendency of nearly all politicians to say\nIf you vote for me and I get elected your problems are solved everything taken care of\nA there will suddenly be birds tweeting and the trees and flowers growing out of the dead and land and etcetera etcetera etcetera [noise]\nOne politician who gives you a different point of view\nWho says hey guess what we've got some problems that politics alone can fix\nIs the junior senator from Nebraska who I think has become by a large margin of advantage or one of\nThe most indispensable voices in the United States Senate his name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to\nMichael thank you for the ... and you're right about those words if I said anything like that it might be asked meter would go off I wouldn't be able to pretend you can save the world by politics but my wife would just why we have five bad\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them why we\nHate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because of a very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics didn't get us into this mess and politics and going to get us out what do you mean by that\n[noise] yeah so I'm sure we're gonna talk something today about politics and why does matter so I don't want them to sleep in your audience and thing but it doesn't it surely does\nBut what we're going through right now even in the calf and our topic really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lock the waves were going to\nProduce more total goods and services around the world has ever known and all of human history partly because of the digital revolution but one of the things that it does is it enables human to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have lots of social science literature now confirming what people are\nKnown for millennia um through philosophy and be allergy which is being rooted makes you happy do you have a family or do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation give some projects with co workers in your community local worshipping community\nIf you have those things you tend to be happy that for about rooted nuts and get our technology at letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age there's this route let's age and so\nTraditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace\nFor cetera there and collapse and to what trying to find meaning grand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can of emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with um Americans believing that you're either all on our side or you're on the other side and the other side as pure evil and our side as pure good\nThat kind of political talk flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal uh relationships and support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking\nI did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys\nAnd anti thought and\nAnd the two groups of of dogs who seem to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another and they follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [laughter]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh if you're from antifa new beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... and he beat up somebody from antifa\nHow does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs were kind of lovable\nRight exactly and they could sing uh it it turns out that you know if you if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that but the great quick kit uh take down it's good to just sort of\nA pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agree with you but you don't persuade anybody that way and so when people use all these warm metaphor for politics I think it's sort of understands what we think any American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can drive and flourish the things that matter are the communities of love and your neighborhood where you persuade people to join with you in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving those local community as well\nBut a lot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural or tribes of affection and community and you know your your point about um about the loneliness align your used there are half\nAs many friends in America are in the last twenty seven years what does that mean social science data showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three point two friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half\nAs many as ... percent of Americans have either to zero or only one Koch to not into all those loneliness back out there and a whole bunch of people go to politics say at least I can figure out how to have a common enemy with somebody else and that will make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator or a Republican\n... is a book a new book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nUm let me try to make a case and you can bet it down if you choose a ... that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nWhere you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing\nIs the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice Kavanaugh and they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump\nThat we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness\nThat we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings that's going to go on and on and on so the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile and very destructive folks\n[noise] yes so let me are overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one tweak so the the overwhelming agreement is I'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaign and what people are so I absolutely want the Republican I'm On a ... not just a expend extend our majority and the fact that I Want the Republicans to\nTo win and the house um\nBut at the ... after that I felt so say I'm the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred in the U.S Senate so if you look at anybody score card on\nThe most conservative senator I'm always on the top half dozen of everybody's scorecard so I'm not in different uh on political matters and this is not an argument hey let's just all ... and how much she met all there's really nobody more conservative than I Am\nBut I think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might do something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if they retake the house\nStopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the healing that's going to satisfy people is\nIn a world where job duration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more a smart humans with brains are figuring out ways to produce more goods and services are more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great but it means average duration at a farm I was born in Nineteen Seventy two\nAverage tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner today it's four point two years and getting shorter\nOne of the things that means is you don't have relationships with your co workers that last over the course of a lifetime\nAnd nails in particular are actually good at forming relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old and so we've got a lot more loneliness and their country pockets can't fix that problem rebuilding our neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book is about fifty percent constructive about what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood I Do I Do I joined with\nA local civic organizations that may not more likely to know the person they live two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with being happy\nAnd uh that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post at our website at Michael ... dot com or a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith\nAnd you do talk about a ... the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country what's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues\nOr have that that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\n... well said so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time I'm In in the same way that deep friendship\nAnd stick a nuclear families and shared work are heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well but we we know in the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family the I'm a few friends\nDo you think your work is meaningful and do you have a philosophical or feel logical for a more to make sense of death or suffering that drives happiness but one of the other things that happens in your local worshipping community\nIs you're with people in an intergenerational context overtime\nAnd it turns out that I've got two teenage daughters and then the younger side as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nPolitical jets and there's a way to deal with is the FBI at it in the Senate confidential process\nThat doesn't start with everything as cable reality t._v. screaming and there were people in our Judiciary Committee who decided that's what they wanted to start and the guy that back to the theme of our half an hour to gather here I really do think there is a desperation\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want or they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve long term problems they're trying to make politics for the center of the gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future I'm speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group to bleed and had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broke and then I found myself ... when does it mean to you today a talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there's only one house and the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there was a sense of praying constantly for the camera and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons why is one of the most conservative or rather than the United states elected premier\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican and the legislature people do not officially ... really parties in our unit camera all our one one house a state legislature and so\nWhat people are mostly doing is wrestling with long term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bill that's cost effective uh they're less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have slightly different priorities which bridge in which highway to find it so much healthier thing\nTo the bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell but if the federal politics do what they should be an American constitutional for them we can maintain a framework for ordered liberty appropriate\nIdea that people are created with dignity and the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights government is the author of sorts of right then government give you a small number of big bang\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happened back in communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up and not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new bestseller my Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska\nAll I can say is keep it up senator we need you here in
