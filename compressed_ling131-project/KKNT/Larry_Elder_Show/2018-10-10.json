encourage it causes much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you may have shown as your question talking about the norms you know I'm listening a liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nBut he violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal but they violate the norms of the Senate\nAnd the eight hundred people showed up about ... how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate but that violate the norms of the Senate didn't think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think their behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\n[laughter] and another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November ... member the eight twenty sixteen but he may not like it might not accept the election since the

general\nNamed Jeff Sessions should have resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his

get a lot in ... uh keeping with what you just said\nYou kind of answered it but I'd like to know why um these people who are running Republican side or restaurants getting in their faces going to Mitch McConnell house at seven thirty in the morning and shouting and demonstrating why aren't they arrested for disturbing the peace\nBecause there are leftist and they represent their viewpoints of the political leadership in charge of the city's Washington DC is in charge of a left wing radical progressive female mayor\nWho kind of wants to protesters to do it in Minneapolis I guarantee you I don't know the the politics of Minneapolis, Minnesota but I get all but guaranteed you is left wing extreme politics that governs that city and whether it's Portland, Oregon or San Francisco or New York city\nNow because the police department as handcuffed by the political leadership they can't do their job isn't that sad\nAnd makes me sick\nAnd why isn't someone saying the Christine Ford you lied about the second door and the front of your house you lied about not taking an airplane\nYou lied about no one helping no one tech and pass a polygraph test you lied every part of your testimony was either a fabrication won outright lie why isn't someone saying what's the best the gay Christine forward for perjury why not do that\nOne of 'em dead ... um uh the senator I'm practically losing my memory I'm so nervous talking to you I'm Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham she ... she needed to be investigated hours that's the way I feel\nEvery name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false every factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I think what happened Jeannie in reality\nIs that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor\nYou are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help\nFor your problem so if tomorrow junior you go to a doctor and say my left hand is hurting\nThe doctor believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist\nHas that Christine for dinner and twenty ... twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist\nThat there were four boys who tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the midnight teenagers you know what I Believe that happened I Believe something fundamentally bad happen to Christine Ford which is why choose when seeking mental health for all these years\nAnd probably what she told the therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys try do rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens who became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties and became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what you told a therapist in twenty twelve and joining Thirteen was accurate when she sold a therapist\nWho rented a room in our house that caused her to put the second front door in our house so patients who come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to rape me in the in my late teens\nAnd the Nineteen eighties then sell 'em out in our mind to get fame or to get money\nShe decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens while I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two and so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took that Democrats are wrongfully league current name which by the way it's a crime dying Feinstein's opposite was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage a record her to come forward\nAnd won the Senate said when the Senate said will come to you in California will make it private\nHer lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell the client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers more so perfect for [noise] um her response is drew out\nI'm feeling sympathy say we're absolutely perfect [noise] um can make you on our side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you are given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue\nBut this woman probably had something happen in her life ... involving those four boys that tried to write a paper\nAnd that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident then damage your life so much she didn't get two master's degrees and a doctorate then damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years at Palo Alto University in Stanford\nAnd and not so bad she isn't written or co authored sixty one books and periodicals\nWhat would she would have done Seventy one books and ... there's no evidence that affected her life at all and every factual statement she made before the Senate was either falls or purposely ally one of the other they've all been proven not to occur\nAnd Gina you're a woman and of course your femininity it's been hijacked by the Democratic party do you want to live in a country where your son your brother and your father does not have due process\nAbsolutely not I Am a Christian and I follow what the Bible says I think a man should be the leader of the house um I\nMean but you know you you you can't say that you can't say that you can't say if I can I just don't know ... I'm a Democrat to please Jeannie ... don't do that because men and women are equal in fact women are ... you know the best people I've known in my life or women whether it's my wife and my sister my mom passed away about five years ago\nMy granddaughter those are the best people I Know and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and be told is a man that I don't care about sexual assault against women\nWhen I think about women are thinking about my wife for forty nine years as an appellate judge and the state of Ohio I think about my sister who's the co chairman of the Republican Party the state of Ohio I think my my beautiful little granddaughter I Want to protect\nDown on a baseball fan so I I kind of ... my way around the table and I said a ... sit down with that I Love to what's your name bill Cunningham he said listen to you now and then\n... thank you Mr Armstrong call me Neal please call them and you know so we had small talk for ten or Fifteen minutes and we got up to leave and I kind of walked out with some chit chat with him about the reds are the bangles or something going on and there was a photographer standing there named bill ranking who later who earlier became famous for taking the the\nBruno Molly photo shoot I'm O.J Simpson were on there was hardly Bruno mile issues Monday Night football game in Cincinnati and I said that bill rank and photographer built could you get a picture of me and Neil Armstrong and Neal said why do you want my picture\nWill mail you know you walked on them who they were the first man to walk on the moon is so I ... I got the picture and immediately hurried off and um that was it and other people came up their picture taken with him and he was uneasy didn't want it to happen seat Neil Armstrong was an engineer\nHe didn't seem so it was a pilot and the furthest thing from the truth was a hero he taught for seven years at University of Cincinnati in the school of engineering and every student had him said he was a wonderful teacher a great professor very bright\nBut when you see the University of Cincinnati approached him to name the school of engineering then Neal a Armstrong school of engineering\nBut that makes sense but that makes sense that the school of engineering\nAfter Cincinnati zone Neil Armstrong the answer would be yes but Neal said absolutely not I don't want my name on buildings I don't want that and within a few months\nHe left you see and what he did at that point\nWas simply serve on boards of directors had a farm and Warren County which is a county north of Cincinnati and you see 'em out now and then to the bench but nobody would ever know that that was Neil Armstrong that was the man who walked on the moon because he never carried himself away in any way that Neal was any special than anyone else\nSo when the movie comes out on friday you're going to see the actual real depiction of Neil Armstrong and that was difficult it was to go to the moon in Nineteen sixty nine when there was less than a fifty fifty chance it would come back alive and in fact NASA drafted a two page statement\nTelling the American people that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did not make it and that there forever lost in space because that was the probability of what was going to happen the odds are going there and coming back and being successful and living was less than fifty fifty but Neal took that risk\nAttack in Lebanon other men took it over the next three years\nAnd we're not going back to the moon since\nContinue with your calls\nTo the office and I was a talk show hosts a privilege\nSome of the call his eight seven seven three one three eighty one wanted\nTo see that movie hit a fabulous movie movie reminded me of the ten commandments still counting undergrad American\nAnd skinny a Mac member what they like most about belonging to the conservative alternative to A.

just you know want to be part of the crowd so trying\nTo talk to me about ... or ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose at Texas Senate seat to a clown like bait O'Rourke is that

finding physically attracted to the different strokes for different folks or whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd yeah there there's obviously some liberal natives here in Austin area and some other Houston Dallas a but most of most of the Texas has you know pretty normal solid\nConservatives normal no yeah yeah but yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so uh it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise flus we've now we've got to have

gonna be hard for the for the governor when the U.S Senate seat but\nYou know Scott ... is pretty good governor but nonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flip a Texas or Florida then the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with and and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican can get elected\nHere in Florida and New York and began to me as one in uh taxes looks the same electorally as New York then we're done because Texas and Florida with tempting permanently\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or play I I was not a Trump fan okay I was pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president\nAnd I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that Ted was so\n... and that's why I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning because I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what it was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis hits the Beatles as Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey whoever you want to say doesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump as a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president\nI think is an Iowa denied he hopefully it will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa they're loving thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside\nAnd this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up those guys ... a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz what am done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma that near the charm or whatever you want to call it\nBut Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and moved back to the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circuit twenty four hour Whitney Houston circuit twenty three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town\nIt's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch what Trump you got to ride that baby for all its warts and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a

Steve in Springfield, Massachusetts Massachusetts state welcome to the ... show and said please go ahead\nOh I I've spoken before on WHYY anti ... will be for doing buddy\nI tell you what I couldn't be any better now give me alive update what if the house becomes controlled by Nancy Pelosi and the fat feckless one Jerry Nadler\nPeople need to take seriously this is our battle of the ball I Hope child arts campaigning for all house members because actually we had our own house killing Jordan needs to be the next speaker for us to go forward\nAnd what happens all the investigations of the FBI and the the OJ the Democrats have the gamble in the house what happens\nTo be done is terrified of Hillary of more than\nA un done\nDone in other words I'm saying that the Democrats get the gamble thing of all the revelations that have come out of the house about the misconduct the top of the deal J uh Andrew McCabe et cetera and the top of the FBI all those individuals\nHave been out at because of their false information given for the Pfizer war and it's all this stuff for fusion GPS that came only because the house Republicans had the gamble and Jim Jordan and the other leaders to Trey Gowdy who's retiring if all of a sudden the Democrats control the house\nThey're gonna shut down every investigation conducted by the Republicans and turned to the impeachment of the president and said we can't have that\nLaw we can't just are battling a bold this really is our battle of the budget is a battle that cat be lost it can't\nAll our car country depends on it you know register your brother your clothes and your sister your uncle friends at work if you're an elder relatives all give give elderly people come a nursing home a lot of elderly people are really angry at his cabinet BS\nYou know I Would hope it's much more women tell me there on the side of Brett Kavanaugh and vice versa because women to understand that if we live in a society without due process\nThat means their husbands their boyfriends their sons their brothers their fathers will be judged by the same standard we got to run the think can be your call let's move on to Shane in Springfield, Missouri and Shane welcome to the Marta ... show and Shane please go ahead\n[noise] really enjoying your show I think I had a question are you a while ago when we were we were talking about protesters you were talking about tripling Heinz on them so sorrows would have to pay it you know about or you try them for a crime and put a little more incentive not to be paid to do it\nWhile you know when I'm looking at a self happening in Portland, Oregon will antifa members are pulling white people out of their cars and storing their property that is a hate crime because they're targeting individuals based upon their skin color\nAnd the Portland, Oregon police stand by and watch mobs take over control of intersections stopping only white people damaging their card to curse at them and these are privileged white people doing it you can imagine if somebody with a ... mega hat\nWas polling someone blackout of a car somewhere that that person should be arrested indicted but when white it'll lead radical liberals in Portland, Oregon in front of the Portland police\nTargeting intersections and stopped traffic why can't the mayor of Portland stand up and say enough is enough stop it it's amazing what's going on\nYeah I agree it's horrible\nIt's horrible ... and his team puts behind this you know and watch it on Fox right now to my right uh and I'm watching the left as protesters takeover\nIntersections of Portland, Oregon and the downtown section pulling out white people beating on their car and using or using racial epithets against him and you can't have this\nHard to prove to hate crime they wouldn't be hard to prove they hate us\nIt's not going to happen in Oregon I guess but what about the U.S department of justice doing it what about Jeff Sessions in the FBI and all the rest of what about that\n[noise] I agree that's where should come from the top\nBecause you know in Charlottesville what went out one white skinhead ran into a crowd and killed some woman he was charged with murder in Virginia and then he was charged with a hate crime now I don't know why it's a crime if a white person kills a white person but nonetheless I went back to spend the rest of his life in jail because he killed ... woman who was protesting I'm with them\nAnd when and when when white supremacist march or on Charlottesville yelling about Jews you're talking to a guy this practice all with Jews most of my professional life I'm disgusted by that\nAre running around Charlottesville at night with tiki torches talking about the N word and about Jews that's bad stuff that happens but ten times that stuff happens\nOn the left all the time and it's never confronted in reality for what it is which is ... from the left\nThere's much more hate from the left and from the right there's many more hate crimes on the left and on the right but they're never prosecuted that where they\nNo no they're not\nWell shame we've got to go thanks for your call this move on to John and California John in California Welcome to the market limited show John please go ahead\nI Want to ask you a great legal mind the question from the school again after ... over they're controlling the streets in Oregon and the mayor's ordering them to the police to stand down so that people can be assaulted their property can be destroyed the mayor be charged for aiding and abetting those who are against\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with one state authorities actor honor act on their color if state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon is part of an unspoken conspiracy the object to which is to violate someone civil rights who have the right to travel and when these individuals' confronted Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property and then one authorities to not arrest those individuals\nAnd this happened in Washington DC\nThis was under color a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted in such a way to do is to deny the human rights\nOf Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice under Jeff Sessions\nThese things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color upstate law and the fact is not good not and the other thing that drives me crazy John is that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine a large numbers of radical individuals taking over as\nIntersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking white citizens'\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and say not in my city there's tape on Fox tonight of Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything to happen this is despicable this is wrong it can happen in America\nAnd the man is lying is political gender to go for it or didn't even expect the governor to step up and say I'm going to bring in the national guard on my ... my state back I'm gonna take my city back I'm not going to tolerate this maybe somebody above it needs to step in the federal government and we can't have America like that they have all this violence\nBut well I think the mere Portland believes what he's doing his politically popular he's doing what the citizens of Portland want him to do and elected him to do it\nAnd so how is it possible that a great American city not in the south but Portland, Oregon allows in teeth ought to take over city streets block intersections line in front of federal buildings making an impossible for federal agents to do their job\nAnd the mayor of Portland a clown a feckless full name wheeler does absolutely nothing to stop it because it's politically it's popular to do that in Portland, Oregon\nYou know John how is that possible how do we get ourselves in this situation the instability on the left his unspeakable\nIt's after ... says this movement that's all they are saying that thank you for your a great job current in front of great when John\nThank you and when I watched what happened on the Supreme Court on Thursday Friday Saturday and even today on break Kevin O's first day on the job large numbers of individuals in violation of federal law committed criminal trespass on federal property\nAnd I'll watch them climbing on top of the un statues and scratching up the doors of the United States Supreme court how\nHow do they do this in public committed ... literally thousands of crimes in public a few are arrested there find like fifty dollars on the first violation and then the second time they might be a night in jail and the guy paying it as

tell us factually what's going on in Portland, Oregon\nOh it's nothing short of anarchy [noise] um we can go back to the uh take care of the study of America let that go on for months and they disbanded that finally got the best of the police chief [noise] um [noise]\nSome of them moved to city hall and you may recall a story where a a protester stabbed his civilian yeah yeah right I encounter that individual about two days prior\nAnd he was hauling out a flight on a guide on and said I'm a badge I said I was just shaking my head me she turned across the street subject for me to hear that one because I'm shaking my head [noise] um\nWhat what are you talking about the ticket over city streets I see this video and there's a cop standing by watching individuals who beat up on cars stopping city streets and better explain what's going on\nIs that [noise] [noise]\nThe mayor told the police to stand down I don't think the chief is going to stand for that very much longer\n[noise] um [noise] it's it's an arcane it is they uh they let these protests they call them peaceful protests mind you they let these contracts in this case it is over a\nCivilian and that was shot by a police officer\nResponding to another shooting so they all take on the Senate structure for going on two weeks now at a believer ... pedophile pedophile being Harvey Milk they've decided to rename the street and um they've been there for two weeks now and it's time to let the city habit street back it's ridiculous\nHow is it possible that a few dogs into antifa protesters can take over an intersection in downtown area of the city for you're telling me weeks and the police do nothing about it\nBasically for the most part they let them go bell bell jar chocolate low road and then they decided to grow up at the end of a work day I don't know what the what what what the motivation as they just pick and choose what they want to do something\nThey're covering the news or people angry about what's going on\nKnowing a cover the the the uh the left slant to appear unfortunately we don't really have a non biased news network\nSo you don't have television condemning this kind of misbehavior they cover it as if they have a valid point\nOut of our local conservative talk show radio host up here in in Portland and now we don't have a voice saying otherwise\nWell it does is pearly to conceal carry steak can you have your own weapon yes isn't it so much riskier be pulling people out of cars and stopping them and beating their vehicles with sticks and baseball bats another bit dangerous\nAll you may recall a story about two years ago was a one Mr Strickland poll has a firearm out of four and a half seconds to push back a group of people are touching them an intimidating him he is\nUnder various federal charges right now trying to fight all that back because they said he's come down on him rather than the people that were intimidating him\n\nI'm On my friends I [noise] I watch\nActually I listen to the key Haley conference with the president [noise] where it was announced that she was leaving the United nations at the end of the year she had already pulled the president this [noise] prior to\nThe I don't know when to do was made clear several months ago running so there's speculation as to why is she leaving\nBecause of course nothing could actually happen for orderly and milk us reasons seems to me that two years of the United nations or one should be up for a monument\nSomewhere in the capital\nEspecially if you're confronted the bad guys of the world is Nikki Haley has and it was done by during the eight years abroad Obama\nAnd keeping true to a major left wing\nAttitude toward life you when\nYou don't fight this is an ancient soul music phrase those who are cruel to the kind or better those were calling to the crew will be cruel to the kind\n\nThat is a motto of our dear fellow citizens of the left ... liberals are left and that is that they are kind to the cruel like the Iranian regime and they are cruel to the kind like Israel\nThat's a perfect pitch truly a perfect example there was something truly sick\nThere's a there's a morality of the conscience for those who work kinder to Iran than to Israel or to Hezbollah or to come or ... or to all of them\nMickey Haley has been extraordinary of the United nations Donald Trump has been extraordinary that the United nations\nAfter all the United nations ambassador reflect the will of the president of the United states\nI repeat that the risk of what\nIs the risk but I think of it but what is the risk getting my sings at us for the president of the United states has\nBeen a great president\n... well the risk is\nThat you alienate those who hate the president but I have a model with regard to that\nI adopted this when I ... in my first full time job\nAnd I was ... the director of a Jewish Institute in California that's why I moved from New York to California in my twenties to direct this Institute they had weekend retreats which gorgeous facility thirty two hundred acres\nThey had this summer sessions for young people and I would advocate gobs existence and I would advocate observance of the laws in the Bible and so on\nSome members of the board or very afraid of my advocacy of God's existence set observance of the laws of the Bible and so on\nAnd they uh they would say to me you know not not not with hatred or anything like that are just they would be worried and they would say you know you'll alienate some of the people who come and I developed a great phrase\nThat has guided me you can't alienate the alienated they already worry alienated [laughter]\nThat's why they showed up\nSo but I you know a friend begged them to cover somebody treated them through a weekend or whatever so you know I'll alienate people by saying that the president of the United states has been great develops far I don't think those people have already been alienated\nI guess that's all it takes is is a favorable word of a mirror vote for Republican\nAnd you're pro rape you understand how ... does become there are no limits to what the left will say that there are no moral limits to what that he will do or say\nWho is this person who tweeted about the the ... you know do something for the good guys and that somebody should take a breath capital a teacher yeah it was a teacher\nYeah ...\n... is a special ed teacher in Minnesota and and so this is one cracks me up a ... so was this on a Facebook account or a tweet so Twitter has decided to suspend this person's account suspend\nYou publicly called for murder and your your account is suspended\nDidn't they suspend James Woods who called for no no violence whatsoever who's barely a well by the way he is truly\nOne of the ... people in the country I I don't read many tweets but I read I read his my wife sure the chosen to me\nIt's a it's an extraordinary thing so anyway ah he has been great it is an astonishing thing I Do worry I admit it or would like to let me can I play ball Street Journal hear ya I admit it I'm just saying I worry\nWas do you think that because I support the president I have a band in critical fought and I may be wrong by the way I was just telling you I'm worried I'm not telling you I oppose what he's doing but I Am worried U.S China strains deep and and I there was only one reason one\nThat I Am worried about us China relations you know what it might be I don't think the Chinese would invade Taiwan\nLittle hotel rooms are good because North Korea\nI think that if China says to Kim Jong un don't continue\nThe nuclear ... and then he won't he's too reliant on China I sat with China's way of holding us hostage is is North Korea there is no no no other\nSo that's the reason I worry about that that China has abuse the world Trade Organization that it is abused intellectual property it's I I personally a worry more about China's about
