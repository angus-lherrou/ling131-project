many people go through life not knowing that they've got to co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nWell right now I think at this point in time as more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people and we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin D day of bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the University of Hawaii talking about vitamin D and colon health\nI mean who thinks of those things right\nYeah that's amazing so I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formulate a co Q. super loose formula in addition to that I said to channel look we should put some B. twelve and here as well it's called ...\nAnd I say that because the

super formula who needs it and why is this in your opinion the next generation of co Q. supplementation and how does purity free bottle offer work\nWell look I think there's a distinct advantage to having energy endurance and stamina and if we were going to isolate the nutrients and create what we would call a daily essential and somebody gave me the assignment list the top five or six nutrients that we need to literally give us energy to build endurance to bill stamina\nI went to list the following nutrients\nCo Q. ten resveratrol B. twelve and vitamin D day this is the advantage as we're

online appear these Web sites only right here through this special offer\nLimit of one free bottle per household that toll free number again\nOne eight hundred\nSomething around seven million okay then that was kind of what the average person that had doubled their wealth while they were in Congress had done and this isn't just an aggregate number of people that get skewed by a few folks this was actually looking at individuals\nThey are also some individuals in Congress that claimed that they actually then had negative net worth\nI'm which I'm not sure I really want those people making financial decisions for me but be that all is it may\nHere was the point it these people make a hundred and Seventy four thousand dollars a year sensibly and yet they're becoming phenomenally wealthy I mean you ask questions like how did Dennis Hastert go from being a high school wrestling coach to being worth ten million dollars when he walked out of Congress\nYo Nancy Pelosi has done this is a bipartisan thing okay hazards are Republican blows who's a Democrat\nAnd you know she's made phenomenal amounts of money because of how transportation projects have been routed through her area and places where she's on property and there's a ton of stuff like this Harry Reid's made a boatload of money on real estate by buying stuff and then the other government projects in the area\nThe point I Want to make is this these people are totally divorced from the average person these people don't I don't think give a hoot about anybody but themselves in the vast majority of cases I understand there are exceptions there are people who are trying to do the right thing but\nWith all due respect if you're trying to do the right thing I don't know why you're running for these offices because it should be a parent to anyone who's in these offices that is become a sense the impossible to do the right thing\nNow what does this have to deal with the market what I'm seeing coming in and again I don't know who's going to win elections in two thousand and Eighteen I'm not saying who should win or who I'm favoring\nBut if the Democrats win the house and a lot of people think they will\nThat that have tremendous implications to the downside for the stock market you know people talk about well you only have a divided government it tends to be good for the markets well not when the one branch of the government is spending all of his time investigating the other branch which is what's going to happen you will effectively ... two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd if you look it was driven this market hire\nThe market first of all after inflation didn't really go much of anywhere from the year two thousand two the year two thousand and six teen\nStarting with the election until now now there are some tremendous gains in the market although it's still only give you about four percent a year and kind of capital gain not again that's not even factoring in inflation so still hasn't been great but it's gotten somewhat better\nPart of the reason is is there's this belief that taxes will continue to come down that regulation will be more under control\nAnd if we spent two years investigating and the most ruthless manner possible which is what I see coming investigating the president I'm not sure that's going to be good for markets and the question is what do we do about it\nNow I'm going to talk about a number of other factors that are out there but there's a lot of things that are kind of screaming that we're really close to a top in this market so the class that I'm going to be teaching is before\nThe crash it's going to be strategy is both for the market ... to go up as well as protection strategies and very importantly strategies for making money when the market goes down if you want to come to class and the teacher personally you can get to free tickets and free tablet when you come out plus we'll feed your lunch\nBe one of the next dozen callers

harder for you\nWho should your money workforce brought you buy online trading academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education\nAll right this week I Want to get into some signs I see of the top in the market but in the first segment just to recap briefly\nI look at the share of vitriol and hatred on both sides\nIn what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which side to that argument Iran\nFirst of all if you believe firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay and you can they say well then that means ... that means y understand all that\nBut realize the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned I have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach\nBut the idea of this is before the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money in the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors well defined investors me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realize that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong\nAnd again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly if you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nRanch now\nWhat are you doing [noise]\nI was just telling everyone how great you are\nMake some good

is Shannon welcome back to who should Germany were for you work hard for your money learn how to make your money work harder for you who should your money workforce brought you buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education\nAll right real quick before I get to the signs that we might be during the top and the market I just want to finish the kind of one thought from the last segment\nI was talking about kind of in my opinion the futility of technical analysis now understand this is someone that being me\nWho when I was learning to trade years ago went to pretty much every hotel seminar there was out there who spent and I kid you not tens and tens of thousands of dollars\nLearning about technical analysis buying software I studied the wave and the Fibonacci and all that stuff and I kid you not I can talk that as well as anybody\nAnd here's what you find out when you really get into it is that it has no real predictive value\nAnd if it doesn't really have any predictable you let me let me say be tens of thousands of course you're okay\nThere's no point in spending the time and money learning something that fundamentally doesn't work and again I Would get back to if this really work why are there are hundreds of different technical indicators why they're literally an infinite number of adjustable parameters well it's because after the fact that it's really easy to say well that would have worked\nBut again unless you make enough money in the markets to buy a time machine I'm not sure that's really all that valuable\nThe next big approach that people take and I spend some money on this as well as what's called the fundamental analysis\nReally studying these companies and understanding what they do and all the rest of it well the problem is first of all that relies on you knowing things other people don't know and the first question is what are you going to know the Goldman Sachs doesn't already know the\nSecond thing is is that a lot of what we're told it's not that we just don't even know stop what we know it was wrong I Would actually argue on most of these companies we have negative information because most of what we're told isn't for our benefit in fact none of it's for our benefit me think about this\nThe market is a zero sum game and this is something I cover in class at sometimes as controversial but I Will prove it to\nThe market is a zero sum game now if the market is a zero sum game\nThan Goldman Sachs these guys make boatloads of money which I Will show you in class as well somebody's losing boatloads of money and over time it becomes the retail trader\nAnd it's because they're acting on bad information and they're not ever understanding that well they might be wrong sometimes and the key to this whole thing is whenever you get into you know what do you want to call investment a trade or whatever\nThe first question to always ask is how bad could this be and can I\nBut with that because of the answered that has no it doesn't matter how good it could be all that matters is can you deal with that loss and by the way the amount of money you should be willing to lose in any given investment shouldn't be any more than kind of one percent of your account\nBecause you're gonna have losers have losers in a row it's just the way the math works you may have six eight ten losers in a row even have happier trades make money\nAnd you can make a lot of money if happier trades make money okay but most people\nCan't make money even if sixty or Seventy percent of their trades make money because on the trades were they lose they lose a lot and that's the thing we have to really avoid and again this is the kind of stuff I'm going to cover in class and and just real quick for the those views tuning in\nWhen I look at this market I see a lot of dangers in this market in the first segment I kind of talked about I think the election this fall could be really pivotal for this market\nI don't have a dog in the fight I don't you know I can make money up or down it makes no difference to me but I think that if you have Democrats control of Congress after the fall and you may think this is the greatest thing in the world and that's not my argument\nMy argument is I think there's going to have a tremendous impact on the markets and can be exceptionally negative because what you've just lived through a judge Kavanaugh you're going to live through a Donald Trump for the next two years because it will be two years of hearings\nAnd it will be brutal and it will be bloody and it will it\nIs not going to inspire confidence market's dropped thrive on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things but those things have helped the market we have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly\nSo that the class something to be teaching and and by the way it totally aside from that\nThere's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nAnd I'm really getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes\nBut the to me the key is\nYou have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad as it happens way too fast and you can't react and time you've got to be position before it happens now when the markets fall as I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the U.S and the gay backs Thirteen Years of profits in the year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to his two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years\nAnd people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investing horizon is thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside\nThat's very very hard than for people to achieve their goals\nSo going to be talking about how do we identify the prices which big institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at\nYou know when he was buying apple it a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five that would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was by an apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how do I want to actually make money when this stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is is they invest in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have losses okay\nIf you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay and my dad's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those would be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world is changed in my opinion from a marketing a RINO manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you could always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at at charts and looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nThere's a fundamental we'd better approach again that I Wanna teach in class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T.
