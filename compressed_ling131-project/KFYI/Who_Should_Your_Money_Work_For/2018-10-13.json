how to make your money work harder for you who should your money workforce brought you buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education All right this week we're talking\nThe show we've talked a lot in the past about how I just don't believe in is is just to extend its not just because I'm skeptical although I'm skeptical person if they don't make any sense and if you think about it for about five minutes she's oh well this is absurd why do we believe these things\nBut we're taking it a step further on the show which is so why why does anyone care why does it matter well if your fundamental view of the economy is strong it's growing in earnings are good\nThen you're going to behave in a certain way and what you realize is that this is a Potemkin village\nAnd we're making things look good by borrowing from future demand to make things look good today but to do that we have to borrow a bunch of money in borrowing money is getting more expensive and therefore we're getting closer to the end of this you maybe have been a very different way when\nThe chairman of the Federal Reserve comes out and says hey we have three point seven percent unemployment and his quote is that the ... the outlook for the economy is remarkably positive\nThen he's going to view changes in interest rates and changes in what's called quantitative tightening very differently then again if he realizes is all just smoke and mirrors or due to budget cuts and now we're going to operate just on matters of ...\nThat was I was in a favorite cartoon so I remember I saw that but it's great so at any rate so what we talked about also in the last segment is\nKay ... the key to this is what makes a modern economy workers debt alright there's the the economy the United states is having to borrow three to four dollars every year to get a dollars worth of growth so one of the reasons I don't believe the statistics is is that really gross\nSee actual growth comes from two things the number of people working and how much stuff they can make an hour well we have Ninety five million people in this country not working and productivity basically isn't changing anywhere in the world except for ... you don't underdeveloped countries\nSo if we don't have more people working and we don't have the people working making more stuff\nHow do you have grows well you know you mascot by borrowing huge sums of money in efficiently in order to try to bring demand forward in order to try to be able to make things look better than they really are which again has been going on now for decades this isn't a Trump thing this is an Obama things not even a Bush thing\nThis has been going on since Reagan at a minimum okay and you may even argue before that\nSo if you have a world in which there isn't any real growth and it's all being driven by that Kim continuing to grow the debt is critically important to making things continue to look good\nWell there are two things you need to continue to grow debt\nOne is willing borrowers and one is willing lenders and both of that those people require faith that things are going well are getting better if that mindset changes then all of a sudden all hell breaks loose and you end up with what you had in two thousand and eight or two thousand\nWhen all of a sudden there's a change in psychology and that's the thing that we have to be careful of what I was talking about in the last segment is the biggest risk to change in psychology is\nAll of a sudden Democrats take control of the house and again not a political statement you may think that's the greatest in the world that's not my point\nMy point is there will be two years of investigations of anyone who's ever stayed as the Trump Hotel anyone who's ever use the word Trump playing bridge that's them out of it OK there'll be a big that'd be bridged players will be for no Trump will be on their science for for my red flares up there so at any rate\n... it's going to be chaos okay it's going to be division you think again the Kavanaugh step was bad this will be a whole nother level okay now again you may think that's great you may think Trump's evil all the rest of it not my argument\nMy argument is is that's not going to be good for the economy and it's not going to be good for the markets because the confidence will be lost the other thing playing into that is the fact that interest rates are going up\nIn a market that's built on debt and is built on cheap money and built on bringing in demand from the future to today if money becomes more expensive that becomes a lot less lucrative for people to do I mean if you can borrow money one or two percent your big us company", "year": "2018",
