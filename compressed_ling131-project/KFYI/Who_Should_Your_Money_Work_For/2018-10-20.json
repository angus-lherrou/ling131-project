comfort and and of course you need to walk around but you need to sit down again and you don't want to do that you know that but it is you move along and your years\nI think all of us in the kind of lifestyles we're living we're gonna have some symptoms of this we're gonna be in a static environment where we can't move around too much\nAnd for hours and hours that blood is going to a pool and the lower half in our legs and so I'm gonna get swelling and so on and of course it's just overlooked in Europe it's that prescription we talk about well it's not that costly there here it's over the counter all you need to hear as\nWell what kind of symptoms having why should I use this\nAnd of course we're reporting all the good science from the medical literature over the years\nAnd this started in the Nineteen Seventy\nSo my we have over four decades abusive there's millions of prescriptions it's just been overlooked we love talking about this story because for a lot of people it's the first time\nThey've ever heard that something can be done\nAbout your spider Bain about that discomfort about swelling about your limp system where we're talking about things where the fans get weak way down into the small blood vessels we want to make sure that good circulation we have a return system to the heart to do that\nWe want to strengthen up those they were these wonderful citrus

you've heard even hemorrhage if you're lucky enough to be dealing with that now bill before we further discuss the lake billions of them are white issues\nI Want to ask you about the loop system because earlier you mentioned the new reprint is also good for the loop system to ride so why is that so important\n... systems kind of the garbage system it take stuff out and and get that circulation going so that are just things\nThat we dispose of in our body's lymph system is there for that and of course you've got to get that worked and so it goes along with the venous system because it's part of the returns system is to get things disposed of into our system so that it it to the cells clean themselves up the limb\nIs there to make sure that we have a good immune system too because it takes things away and so it's all part of great circulation in our body and and we want those things we want to remain healthy but then when you have these things don't wait until this becomes unsightly and then\nIt's just cosmetic makes you do it all of that coming from week Bain's in the legs so it it spans this and of course what's that telling you and of course we want to get these blood vessels\nExpanding dial aiding and that that's the the other part of it we didn't understand early on is it it's not just making the bane stronger it dilate and white and the sea small

study purity products now making it available it's called new for print H. D.\nToo much recap this incredible story tell us once again when new reprint can do for our veins both cause medically\nAnd otherwise and I and I just want to remind our listeners of just how well these active ingredients really work in fact\nIn one study five hundred and twenty two people who took this ... extract and Ninety four percent of them reduce advocacy is either high or very high this Ninety four percent so people are really going to love the results\nThat we find that we have to say everything three times\nBecause it's all new to our audience so we are repetitious but that's for a good reason we want to make sure that they got the story that this wonderful product ... products right here from Europe to make sure Americans got the story\nThat you can get what's a prescription good you're if you get it here it's for cosmetic reasons it's for good circulatory reasons is for every thing good about our system in a sedentary society we all are going to have in our lifetime issues with our venous system we've given you some hints today\nAnd talking about the swelling and talking about the spider veins in talking about the circulation and what you can do about it and of course we're addressing the cause not just the symptoms we want to make sure\nThat you get optimum circulation you want to have this being a system working it's the lower half of our body to get the blood back to the heart so it can get re oxygen aided again\nWhat does it is these wonderful citrus appeal extract\nThat we find in purity products new ... H. D. ... high dose meaning it's the same dose they used in the clinical studies purity wants you to try it had Campbell is going to tell you how to get it\nYou don't think so much let me get the best special offer for Thirty years millions of Europeans have experienced the magic of these special doctor prescribed citrus extracts\nFor them as many healthy circulation powerful support for the lymph system smoother more attracted waves and believe it or not effective management and relief for hemorrhage something Americans just haven't had many good options for to me surety products is trying to make it impossible for you to resist trying new we're primed for yourself here's the deal\nPick up the phone call right now ... going to rush you on a free bought a new friend to put to the test you just pay for shipping only four Ninety five which is one hundred percent refundable by the way then you try you decide whether it's spider means ... issues occasional ... when we moved the ankles were\nGeneral circulatory health weakening veins cannot be ignored fast acting newer print is the perfect answer for both the short term issues and the long term health for underlined Venus structure and function just pick up the phone and call purity and ask for your free bottle\nThe worst and what it means is because there is so much value in power and we've all so talked about this a lot\nNo one's going to be willing to give up this power when you have a few thousand people deciding how to split up three and a half four trillion dollars of government spending who gets to write the rules and regulations for everybody else\nThat's a tremendous amount of power and these people become phenomenally wealthy there's actually a website called open secrets dot a I think it's out of work\nAnd if you go there and what you can find out is the net worth essentially if every person in Congress and you can actually track it over time and I haven't looked in a couple of years\nBut I remember being very stunned that if you look at the percentage of Congress people who essentially at least doubled their net worth while they were in Congress it was well over a third of the people\nAnd the people that had doubled their net worth and I'm not going to get the number is exactly right but this will be closed they they went from that you know worth of about one point seven million dollars to something around seven million okay and that was kind of what the average person that had doubled their wealth while they were in Congress had done\nAnd this isn't just an aggregate number of people that get skewed by a few folks\nThis was actually looking at individual\nThey're also some individuals in Congress to claim that they actually had negative net worth\nI'm which I'm not sure I really want those people making financial decisions for me but be that all is it may\nHere was the point it these people make a hundred and Seventy four thousand dollars a year sensibly and yet they're becoming phenomenally wealthy\nI mean do you ask questions like how to Dennis Hastert go from being a high school wrestling coach to being worth ten million dollars when he walked out of Congress you'll Nancy Pelosi has only this is a bipartisan thing okay hazards Republican blows who's a Democrat\nAnd you know she's made phenomenal amounts of money because\nOf transportation projects have been routed through her area and places where she's on property and there's a ton of stuff like this Harry Reid's made a boatload of money on real estate by\nBuying stuff and then the other government projects in the area\nThe point I Want to make is this these people are totally divorced from the average person these people don't I don't think give a hoot about anybody but themselves in the vast majority of cases\nI understand there are exceptions there are people who are trying to do the right thing but with all due respect to be trying to do the right thing I don't know why you're running for these offices because it should be a parent to anyone who's in these offices\nThat has become a sense the impossible to do the right thing\nNow what does this have to do with the market what I'm seeing coming in and again I don't know who's gonna win elections in two thousand and Eighteen I'm not saying who should win or who I'm favoring\nBut if the Democrats win the house and a lot of people think they will\nThat that have tremendous implications to the downside for the stock market you know people talk about well you only have a divided government it tends to be good for the markets well not when the one branch of the government is spending all of his time investigating the other branch which is what's going to happen you will effectively ... two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd if you look it was driven this market hire\nThe market first of all after inflation didn't really go much of anywhere from the year two thousand two the year two thousand and sixteen\nStarting with the election until now now there are some tremendous gains in the market although it's still only give you about four percent a year and kind of capital gain not again that's not even factoring in inflation so still hasn't been great but it's gotten somewhat better\nPart of the reason is is there's this belief that taxes will continue to come down that regulation will be more under control\nAnd if we spent two years investigating and the most ruthless manner possible which is what I see coming investigating the president I'm not sure that's going to be good for markets and the question is what do we do about it\nNow I'm going to talk about a number of other factors that are out there but there's a lot of things that are kind of screaming that we're really close to a top in this market so the class it ought to be teaching is\nBefore the crash it's going to be strategies both to the market June to go up as well as protection strategies and very importantly strategies for making money when the market goes down if you want to come to class and the teacher personally you can get to free tickets and free tablet when you come out plus we'll feed your lunch\nBe one of the next dozen

Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in\nTrader education All right this week I Want to get into some signs I see of the top and the market but in the first segment just to recap briefly\nI look at the share of vitriol and hatred on both sides\nIn what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which side to that argument Iran first of all if you believe firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay\nAnd you can they say well then that means act so that means y understand all that\nBut realize the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned I have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if the right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the idea that this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach\nBut the idea of this is before the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money in the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realized that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong\nAnd again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly if you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nWell it's not like I'm going anywhere for the next couple of hundred\nYears I Know I Love it a turtle turtle is not here yet man he's late every morning you'd think it would have learned by now to leave the night before meetings okay squirrels anybody\nSeem the

Germany were for you work hard for your money learn how to make your money work harder for you who should your money workforce brought you buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education\nAll right real quick before I get to the signs that we might be during the top and the market I just want to finish the kind of one thought from the last segment\nI was talking about kind of in my opinion the futility of technical analysis now understand this is someone that being me\nWho when I was learning to trade years ago went to pretty much every hotel seminar there was out there who spent and I kid you not tens and tens of thousands of dollars\nLearning about technical analysis buying software I studied the Eliot waving the Fibonacci and all that stuff and I kid you not I can talk that as well as anybody\nAnd here's what you find out when you really get into it is that it has no real predictive value\nAnd if it doesn't really have any predict you let me let me save you tens of thousands of course you're okay there's no point in spending the time and money learning something that fundamentally doesn't work\nAnd again I Would get back to if this really work why are there are hundreds of different technical indicators why they're literally an infinite number of adjustable parameters well it's because after the fact that it's really easy to say well that would have worked\nBut again unless you make enough money in the markets to buy a time machine I'm not sure that's really on that valuable\nThe next big approach that people take and I spend some money\nOn this as well as what's called fundamental analysis really studying these companies and understanding what they do and all the rest of it well the problem is first of all that relies on you knowing things other people don't know and the first question is what are you going to know the Goldman Sachs doesn't already know\nThe second thing is is that a lot of what we're told it's not that we just don't even know stuff what we know it was wrong I Would actually argue on most of these companies we have negative information because most of what we're told isn't for our benefit in fact none of it's for our benefit I mean think about this\nThe market is a zero sum game and this is something I cover in class at sometimes controversial but I Will prove it to\nThe market is a zero sum game now if the market is a zero sum game\nThen Goldman Sachs and these guys make boatloads of money which I Will show to you in class as well somebody's losing boatloads of money and over time it becomes the retail trader\nAnd it's because they're acting on bad information and they're not ever understanding that well they might be wrong sometimes and the key to this whole thing is\nWhenever you get into you know what do you want to call investment a trade or whatever\nThe first question to always ask is how bad could this be and can I live with that\nBecause of the answered that has no it doesn't matter how good it could be all that matters is can you deal with that loss and by the way the amount of money you should be willing to lose in any given investment shouldn't be any more than kind of one percent of your account\nBecause you're gonna have losers have losers in a row is just the way the math works you may have six eight ten losers in a row even have happier trades make money\nAnd you can make a lot of money if happier trades make money okay but most people can't make money even if sixty or Seventy percent of their trades make money because on the trades were they lose they lose a lot\nAnd that's the thing we have to really avoid and again this is a kind of stuff I'm going to cover in class and and just real quick for the those will be tuning in\nWhen I look at this market I see a lot of dangers in this market in the first segment I kind of talked about I think the election this fall could be really pivotal for this market\nI don't have a dog in the fight I don't you know I can make money up or down it makes no difference to me but I think that if you have Democrats control of Congress after the fall and you may think this is the greatest thing in the world and that's not my argument\nMy argument is I think there's going to have a tremendous impact on the markets and can be exceptionally negative\nBecause what you've just lived through a judge Kavanaugh you're going to live through a Donald Trump for the next two years because it will be two years of hearings and it will be brutal and it will be bloody and it will\nIt is not going to inspire confidence market's dropped thrive on confidence it also means that his ability to continue to cut taxes and regulation again you may think those are bad things but those things have helped the market\nWe have to realize that all of that is at risk of changing pretty quickly\nSo that the class I'm going to be teaching ... and by the way it totally aside from that\nThere's some other things out there right now that indicate that the market may well be near the top\nAnd I'm really getting into to those ideas in just a couple of minutes but the to me the key is\nYou have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad as it happens way too fast and you can't react and time you've got to be positioned before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the U.S and the gay backs Thirteen Years of profits in a year and a half\nThat's how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to his two thousand level and that was short a lot of times it takes twenty and twenty five years\nAnd people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon most people's investing horizon is thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years\nAnd you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside\nThat's very very hard than for people to achieve their goals\nSo going to be talking about how do we identify the prices which big institutions like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at\nYou know when he was buying apple at a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five that would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was by an apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics of how do I want to actually make money on this stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is is they invest in stocks because they think they're safe socks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have losses okay if you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay\nAnd that's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I've ... I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those would be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world is changed in my opinion from a marketing a RINO manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you could always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at at charts and looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nThere is a fundamental we'd better approach again that I Wanna teach in class so if you want to come out you can get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T.
