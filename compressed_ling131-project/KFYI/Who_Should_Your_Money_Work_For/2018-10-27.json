enhanced and redesigned powerfully support your joints cartilage and connected to choose here's the deal\nSo everybody loses and so what are all the little things I mean there's the obvious stuff you can do but what are the little things that really make the difference and we've kinda gotten to a level of sophistication now where we can spend a lot of time on the small stuff because we've got the big stuff down pretty well so kind of taken a big step back\nYou say what are kind of the knowledge things that people really need to know to be successful in the markets\nAnd for those of you who come to the half day classes that I teach what I'm doing is giving you an overview of these ideas but I'm also given a lot of really really important information to understand things like for example housing market really works which by the way it is totally different than what you've been taught\nWhat everyone is hot is it is about identifying good companies and buying them and holding them forever and it's all about company earnings and you know you take that this kind of cash flow of the future earnings and you own a piece that none of that is true okay it may be at one point it was true although I don't really think so but it certainly isn't true now\nIf you look at the valuations this market it has nothing to do with reality or Tesla could not have been worth more than General Motors and Ford and everything else\nThere's just no basis for it other than understanding it as\nThe market is a marketing exercise now what do I mean by that what I mean is the stocks get hyped to you by people that want to sell them to you don't even take a step back another part of the\nMarket that people fundamentally misunderstand is there's this belief out there that the market creates wealth and you hear this all the time since Trump's election Marcus credit seven trillion dollars in well\nWell that's impossible okay and if you really think it through if you biased or a stock for a hundred dollars and it goes to a hundred and fifty how much money if he made\nWas the first key is until you sell you haven't made it time okay you have to sell it to be able to make money and good investors don't buy stuff and hope the really good people and the people like the big institutions they never buy a stock and hope it goes up\nThey buy stock and they make it go up and one of the ways they make it go up is to convince you of how great the company is they will tell you all these stories about things that may or may not ever happen but it will get you to buy the stock from them at a higher price than what they paid and this game is\nExactly like any other retail business it's out there\nThe key is by something and sell it for more\nBut the the retail trade or has been brainwashed into believing that there is an objective outside value for a company that can be known and there's not a share of stock is worth what someone's willing to pay for it okay it's worth what someone will sell it for that yet\nEverything else is just story and marketing and that's the first really really important thing to understand and when you come to the the the class\nI I Will really show you example after example of this and help you understand it because it is critically important\nIf you don't understand the basic game you're playing your chance of winning is very very small so the first thing we do in the class is to really help you understand how this market works and how the marketing works and how quite frankly the manipulation works because if you don't understand that\nAgain it's going to be really hard to win now for those kind of new to the show I teach classes that we give tickets away here on the radio for are loyal listeners if you want to come out to the class it's going to be to reflect all the topics I'm Talking about here today starting with how does the market really work\nIf you want to come out to a class you can get free tickets push will get a free tablet when you come out every one of the next dozen callers the number to call is\nEighty four forty eight trader that's T. R. A. D. E. R. that's eight for for\nAid age seven twenty three thirty seven you can also get to free tickets in the tablet by text and the letters oh T. A.\nAs in online training academy two three one nine nine six again to free tickets and a tablet\nTax to oh T. A. as in online training academy two\nThree one nine nine six\nIf you win tickets pleased registers we know you're coming that we will have your seat or have your tablet will have lunch for you and all will be cool we come back we'll talk more about how to succeed in this market seemed to bet [noise]\n\nHi this is Ken welcome back to who should Germany work for you work hard for your money learn how to make your money work harder for you Hoosier money workforce brought you buy\nOnline training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education well if you're just joining us today shows a little bit different it's kind of more philosophical in some ways and and actually in some ways kind of more practical I guess the normal\nWhere we just got back from a conference and we want a number of words are under the forty three online trading academy campuses worldwide we in Phoenix one was called the brand champion award for the third time and the ... only be given three times so we build pretty good about that\nBut it's essentially because the people who win this or the people who do the best job of representing the values of the company and the values of the company are all about focusing on students' success and we work really really hard at it and it made me think about\nWhat is it that kind of we do I think well in supporting our students which took me to an even bigger question which was\nWhat is it really take to be successful in the markets and talked about in the first segment the first thing you have to understand is what the market's really are which is totally different than what has been sold to us\nThey're not discounting mechanisms of future cash flow you cannot study a company's conference calls and know which companies are going to win and lose because first of all you're never going to know more than Goldman Sachs and city group and the people that run the companies\nThere's always going to be able to have an informational advantage so why should we try to compete where we have a weakness\nThe second part of it is is that the things that make a company successful change over time it's not just about the technology is devoted to raise money the ability to market the ability to sell its about outs about sourcing and logistics is about corporate culture it's about leadership it's about competitive response\nAll things that change over time now one of the difficulties is that the market's done nothing but go up essentially for nine years although maybe seen some change in that right now\nBut when the market's going up every strategy works\nYou know back in the nineties is always talk about never confused genius with a bull market\nAnd I think there's a lot of risk and that today as well everybody that's been buying stocks and you know most people aren't doing great but they're doing kind of okay\nNow they have no real plan for what to do when the market goes down and that's like one of the really key pieces of information how do you not just survive when the market goes down but how do you thrive how do you develop a mindset to where you look forward to the opportunity of the market going down\nA conference one of the people I was talking to Jon O'Donnell's one of the founders of online trading academies are chief knowledge officer and I said so how you do and he said just waiting for the crash so I can be short and that's how we view this and it's not that\nWe don't we ... we wish harm to other people in the market to go down but we know the market's going to go down at some point and again you're starting to see some real weakness in rocky and his and\nAnd again the war's only been given three times we want it three times so we're feeling pretty good right now but it it can be just thinking about what is it that makes someone so they can succeed in the market\nAnd there's really two big pieces one there's this stuff you have to know you have to really understand what the market is you have to really understand risk management the most magical thing about the market is your ability if you know what you're doing to limit you risk when you're wrong because here's the thing all of us are wrong and all of us around a lot\nAnd the key is not losing a lot of money those times that you're wrong that's how you win this game and the long run\nYou get into trade only five things can happen and look and I know people love the word investing and they hate the word trading explained to me how you invest when you can't manage a risk\nAnd if you're buying stocks how do you manage a risk when the market's closed the stock market's only open six and a half hours a day as close Seventeen and a half hours every day as close forty eight hours every weekend your stock can move dramatically while the market's close\nSo and this is I don't want this on the way it's going to sound but how can you call yourself an investor when you can't control your risk your gambler and the vast majority of people are gambling in the markets today the problem is is it for nine years people kind of gotten away with it because the market's just largely been going up\nThe problem is when the market goes down people get crushed and they get crushed quickly because markets fall much faster than they rise so the first thing we have to understand this reality of the market the next thing we have to understand is how do we find the highest probability entry and exit points\nNow in the last segment I talked about what would institutions you know called Goldman Sachs for sake of argument Goldman Sachs doesn't biased stock and just hope it goes up\nGoldman Sachs buys a stock and makes it go up they can make it go up a lot of ways one of the ... which is they convince you that it's a really really good stock and so they can sell it to you at a higher price they also can\nShares to drive the price higher yuan mosques has been you know you people don't like the word and and you know but he's been manipulating the price of his stock\nHow by going out and buying millions of shares it and that you know in a day to push the price higher and then what happens is people have been betting against the stock have to buy the stock back what's called a short squeeze that pushes the stock up further and this is what happens on a daily basis\nAnd if we think that this is all about just finding good companies and holding them forever our chances accessing the market over a lifetime of investing is very very small\nYou have periods in this market were literally for Thirty years the market after inflation doesn't really go anywhere so what we have to be able to do is not just buy it on the hope that we can somewhat later\nBut the key is to identify the points where the institutions that people like the Goldman Sachs are buying and getting ready then to push it higher\nThan also understanding that when they are out of shares they can actually make money by shorting by selling stock they don't own and pushing the price down if we can learn to identify those points with a high degree of probability\nAnd then manage our risk when we're wrong we have actually dealt with two of the three big issues from the knowledge perspective of the markets I'll get to the third one in a moment\nWith these kinds of things that we teach you guys in class if these concepts are of interest to you again I'm putting together a special class just to go through all these kind of ideas that we're talking about here\nHow do we find these entry and exit point how do we minimize or risk the third point is how do we then use the leverage how do we make our money work harder for us that we worked for ...\n... the whole concept of probability risk that leverage is the key to really our approach to the market but we're going to cover a whole lot more than that and the first thing I mean did you guys is the reality of what the what game you're applying and then you can make an intelligent decision is this a game I really want to play\nSo if you want to come out to class you can get to free tickets and you'll get a free tablet when you come out just be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that T. R. A. D. E. R. that's eight for for eight eight\nSeven twenty three thirty seven you can also get two tickets and a tablet plus we featured as lunch when you come out by the way but you can get those if you text the letters oh T. A.\nAs in online training academy two three one nine nine six text the letters O. T. A. as in online training academy two three one nine nine six if you win tickets please\nRegisters we know you're coming otherwise we may not have a seat for you we may not have your tablet may have your lunch\nAnd chaos ensues and we would like to get whatever Roswell so coming back to this\nThe the three main ... of understanding how to make money in this market is understand that this is a game of probability is never a game of certainty but we can get the highest possible probability if we know what to look for\nSecondly the times that we're wrong we're going to randomly be wrong if we knew we were going to be wrong we wouldn't get into the trade so how do we minimize our losses those times were wrong\nThen how do we make our money work as hard for us as possible when you buy stock you generally have to put up at least half the money so if you buy a hundred dollar stock you have to put up you know fifty bucks in some cases you may only have to put up twenty five percent of the money but there are some rules to that", "show_name": "Who Should Your Money Work For", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "27"}
