financial advisors to call you back you'll be able to share with us your concerns some of your goals some of the things that are on your mind and will in turn tell you how we think we can help\nAnd if it makes sense for both parties moving forward we will schedule your first visit with us at one of our offices either in Chandler Scottsdale to get your complimentary Taylor customized one page retirement map review that you've heard me talk so much about on the show again that number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nDo you have a tax plan like do you know what you're doing the next Twenty years do you know what you're doing and to to have an Eighteen to prepare for two thousand and thirty and do you know what the current tax environment is today relative to what you're likely to be in Twenty years from now\nI find that very few people are leaving the gate and the terminal with any sort of plan of how they're going to land in Houston related their taxes whatsoever\nYou know what I think we see this in our kids I mean for those that have kids or grandkids how far in advance does a three year old think that's part of the immaturity\nThe toddler they think about the thing that's going to happen next maybe they think about a Disney trip it's a week in advance but usually it's just what does my snack right now\nCan we go to the park today\nIt's not wow you know the compound interest I could get on an investment account if I started saving will be phenomenal we don't think that what part of us maturing is that we start thinking more through the consequences and the impact of what we do today on the future and unfortunately we live within a society that we all recognize\nReally promotes instant gratification and with our taxes that means just stuff as much money for it is possible and reduce my taxes this year\nAnd so I Want to encourage you if we know that one of our primary landmines to accomplishing our goals is gonna be taxes I mean really simple to take away from this podcast is who's helping you\nCreate efficient tax strategies if you're making right now here's a real practical way to think about this if you are making if you're married and you're earning under three hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars a year of adjusted gross income\nYou should not even for one second considered differing taxes\nWith the new tax reform you're in a twenty four percent tax bracket previous to this dude I'm Seventy you would have had to make less than Seventy five thousand dollars to get under the twenty five percent bracket\nThe only way you would have gotten below the twenty five percent bracket is if you earn Seventy four thousand dollars or less so if you're listening and you even make three hundred grand you're like John I'm doing really well you're in a twenty four percent bracket\nWhy are you different taxes I get it you make too much to contribute to a rap irate but most likely if you're in a big company\nOr you're not very of options to set it up yourself why are you not funny in the ... section of your four one K. why are you putting Eighteen five away that's a ghost and never tax ever again for the rest of your life\nWhat John and I'm gonna have to be twenty four percent tax on the Eighteen five and if I put it in different I don't have to pay that correct\nBut you would have never paid less than twenty four percent in any conceivable scenario ever again for the rest of your life so why would you asked to pay it later enough to be thirty five or forty at some other point in the future\nAnd right now or current tax structure is set to sunset and twenty twenty five now there's no certainty obviously things can change if in a few years\nA Democrat gets elected this'll be one of the first things they go after so who knows how long this opportunity is available but I Want to make sure you understand you need to have a tax strategy in reducing taxes today is not the answer for most of you if you're making over three hundred and fifty thousand now you're up in a thirty two percent bracket maybe you have a little more question on that\nI Would argue that that person should still be putting money in most cases depending on the situation in tax free accounts part of us maturity is that we start thinking more through the consequences and the impact of what we do today on the future and unfortunately we live within a society that we all recognize\nReally promotes instant gratification and with our taxes that means just stuff as much money for it is possible and reduce my taxes this year\nAnd so I Want to encourage you if we know that one of our primary landmines to accomplishing our goals is gonna be taxes I mean really simple to take away to who's helping you

their victims I'm half who sounds Fox News and names I think eight men and three rent and gunned down at a Pittsburgh synagogue has just been released the victims include a husband and wife and a pair of brothers at a news conference a short time ago Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city is revered again\nThey want for their products they can also charged Fifteen dollars for a box of jello if they want\nWhat's going on what the answer what they're making more money bring your own bad like everybody else\nSides\nThat's it yeah yeah it's a no I'm Sorry it would be ... and I understand\nBut I think they can charge anything above that now you could be that the only charge ten cents\nA and uh that's the way it goes I don't know what the law reads I mean you can look up a law that's easy I just look up the statute where they changed it and just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet and go you know ten cents a bag law mandatory bag payment whatever a search word you want\nBut I based on if there isn't a law that says the stores can only charge ten cents\nAnd they must charge ten cents then all they can do is charged sense but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nWow yeah\nSo bring it can be the answer you bring your own damn bag you when you go to the story I don't know what I'm saying I always bring their own recycle bands\n[noise] right right yeah\nOkay there's your answer or what a big legal issue on that one isn't there oh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an hour\nOr what does my lawyer charge 'em whenever I Need legal work just keep in mind died my expertise is\nIs limited as most lawyers are limited in their expertise and mine is insanely limited to a third party reproductive laws you know I I was my lawyer charging I just had an issue with a a lawyer headed I needed some a business documents a six and a quarter an hour\nSix hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers summer seven hundred appeals\nLawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars an hour senior ... senior partners in a law firm you can run nine hundred thousand bucks an hour so when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love law it's a principal thing I Want to file a lawsuit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're absolutely right thank you the other side can't do it anymore and you're out Fifteen thousand dollars\nA Israel Israel I Am here yes or we're going to do for you\nAll right I'll bet you for ten years um you know and I was a pretty good they are to the nomination a long story short my wife had an affair ah the nomination did not care whose fault it was if you're not able to lead the album guy or lead your own house\nCan't lead the album God so I was removed from ministry wow kept my ordination ah for two years I was working back and forth or email thought about getting in ... after\nA finally tears later I was given my termination notice however they backed candidate a day before my ten year where I Would have been backed into my tension play a lot of my church luck I wipe it off by tension there they were my just rude\nAlright well first of all I did what denomination is a happy Methodist\nI'm Sorry free method is yeah you know I deal with that is have you considered becoming let's say a Muslim or a Jew\n[laughter] oh actually I met you ought to use I should just go that route\nAnd you know what I Love that because you know what the uh you know when people call them is the ... Jews people that believe in Christ with that\nThat so we call them\nThere are not messianic Jews just saying just throwing that out always a pleasure talking about that uh there where you can do ah I think you can go for your pension because uh that was knocking you off one day\nA is retaliatory and as predators or a predatory I mean that is I mean they're just a bunch of pastures they really are to do that well hell yeah they sure have that Christian outlook on life don't they\nAh and yeah absolutely and now the issue of uh their belief that you can hold your own house in order you can't leave you certainly can't a lead a house of God a which is also a complete ...\nIf your wife leaves you in a has an affair somehow it's your fault I Love that man that's another reason why he sort of just switching ah religions Israel I mean this this is a tough way to go it really is\nA no no I'm I'm thinking of it that just I don't like the people I got to stop people from my chair\nAlright uh is uh the other possibility of getting in another a person who is your ah another church\nShe and it's funny you say that actually I was just approached by one of the new leaders that just stepped up and and what are the higher conditions and they asked if I were still interested and uh I kinda wondered if if uh if I did do that if they would have to take all the fact that they terminated me and got caught me on fourteen years\nNow that's the other issue is as you talk to or the new folks that you are I'm considering going back to the church or at least having a a a a church or\nWhat what do they call that a person to use a congregation congregation that's the word yeah having your own congregation you want to say can I please be credited\nUh with the two years so my pension kicks in and have a ... not only are we in statement but credit for the two years and if I were if if I were them\nOr or the I Would do I'd give it to you in a heartbeat because it's so unfair to what happened to you\nI mean it really is I mean on the face of it just said you know the fact that you have a a good attitude about this if it were me I was torched the church\n[laughter] anyway so uh the issue is yes I think you have a legal\nA right to go after the pension based on their actions but if you can only do that with a new congregation and the higher ups on the church willing to do that you're home free Israel you know chair matter of fact you don't have damage\nThat is true and I really appreciate that thank you so much All right take care of me not to join that church if I ever convert ah I'm not going to be a free Methodist\nWill be paid Methodist [noise] I think so was that ... that works for sure [laughter] okay\nThis is a handle on the law\nBreaking news as it happens real views in

he do that if he doesn't have a job\nYeah okay I of course all of course yeah you don't need a job to be an emancipated minor so you want to look into that but you know the bottom line is I don't think there's going to be a custody issue I really don't\nOkay 'cause I think some 'cause he's a ...\nYeah I Know I wouldn't worry about it [laughter] I'm doing those film I alright yeah by someone

I talked to an attorney or because there isn't\nA fair and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars to get taken a contingency that one is a problem because if the money's gone uh and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where his lawyer yet that wears away or get paid\nYeah so there has to me and she spent the money ah Regina what do you do\nYeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe helped make somebody said if you go to and file it they can make make myself um I Do you say the ...\nThe executor I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file your score to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a trust trust in a state lawyer I go to the website to do that because there was a lot of pieces on this one\nFor sure sunny hello sunny\nRandall [noise]\nProbably more in the crowd at grad school to let that or you don't hear from LA itself okay that I it and I do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are a the law schools generally do have clinics where they do help people who don't have any money\nOr it's a these pro bono I've organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer\nAnd get some a practice but you're going to need die you're gonna find that out in Georgia sunny\nDay that I that that's highly they've done your\nVacation in Georgia you don't have to call a lawyer in Georgia we call the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\nOkay called enough\nYeah call every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that that do pro bono work\nSunny or are you are you ... are you broke [laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nA ... that are out there and my mom or a bill\nAnd uh this lawyer is spreading or ... or it was a it was a a lot of a combination is known for their dollar for dollar felt when the guy I gave them they uh they they're they're ... and I asked them what to do it\nIf they sent their favorite and pay a fine ... for the death for that but to divert out\nOkay I Know this makes sense on ... you can get the death certificate in two seconds that's that's a public record yeah you're going to need a you're probably going to need some kind of a clinic no lawyers gonna take designed contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars on ours\nSo called the law schools you wanna look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia right\nOkay All right All right All right good luck you know it's just occurred to me that some law schools do have ...
