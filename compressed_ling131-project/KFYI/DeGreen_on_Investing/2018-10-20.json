each one dollars worth of aggregate corporate earnings\nNow we also saw markets sell off from investors on the news that the fed does plan to stay on course what they are planned rate hikes now this is despite President Trump's growing criticism\nNow China released yeah\nPretty disappointing economic numbers making the weakest growth and queue one of two thousand nine now this comes amid pressure from the country's trade war with us now we're going to discuss all of these topics in the context of politics economics and investing that's our subject today actually the grapes collision\nPolitics economics and invest ads right now midterms ... now midterms are just Seventeen days away and early voting has already started in Arizona voter early and often yes right [laughter]\nOh boy last night it's a it was a spectacular rally if you didn't I Hope you saw President Trump arrived to board the presidential helicopter with a U.S Senate candidate Martha ... ah once more at his rally he introduced mix valley called her to the podium gave her the opportunity to speak briefly\nNow tonight he has another rally or in Nevada for Dean Heller\nNow it's about another Senate candidate another Senate candidate now it's about time we see phenomenal efforts by our president to specifically support candidates\nNow that you were Arizona's Republican candidate for us in the U.S Senate in Nineteen eighty eight\nI was the I mean yeah you were you were barely hold enough to serve in the Senate\nFloor yours was the closest race in the country that year against the Democratic incumbent Dennis deacon Seaney but you luck I managed to parlay my youth and inexperience into a defeat yes what what has changed politically since then and it how does that impact us as citizens and as he was invested\nIn very significant changes you know Martha mix Sally\nOr as by now I Hope everyone knows is competing with a Christian send them for the open US Senate seat which is being vacated none too soon\nBy Jeff Flake are enormous amounts of outside money have poured into Arizona sun in support of both candidates now one thing remains true about Washington politics even after all these years\nNinety percent of campaign contributions go two incumbents and Ninety percent of incumbents get reelected but things are changing\nBack then and now we're talking about when I was not a whole lot older than you I'm Republicans in Washington actually acted as though they were doing Senate candidates a favor\nBy supporting them when I received the Republican nomination for the U.S Senate here in Arizona I was immediately invited to the White House and I met personally with Ronald Reagan in the oval office and needless to say that's a you know pictures on the wall here at the office and\nFrequently clients looked at them and we talk about the experience we had a nice chat he and I we discussed specifically the line item veto which was a hot topic at the time\nAnd took photos and video but his staff get this specifically told me before I walked in there\nThat if I asked him to campaign in Arizona for me they the staff does stand up to that would withhold their support I wouldn't get the videos I wouldn't get anything else out of the White House\nI was also pulled aside by one Washington pundit when I was there trying to raise funds for our campaign he said son there are two political parties in Washington and the incumbents and everyone else\nUnder Trump and with the growth of political action committees that has been gone to change and you know people among the so called divisiveness in Washington I applaud it get in there and fight and quit running for miss congeniality\nOr the ... the Republican Party and conservative political action committees are finally starting to act like Republicans and conservatives by aggressively supporting their candidates\nIncumbency still means a lot in terms of raising money from special interest or someone last from a political action committees these days but it means a lot less overall that wants to\nHave it sit down and I'm not sure what specific hangar they used for the rally last night\nBut I I think I recognize that when I watched on TV and I think I Know who might have owned that hangar some years ago they used that hangar because it's private quote privately owned or some years ago when I was practicing law I represented either do practice we were investment advisory firm and I also um help clients\nAnd some years ago uh when I was a practicing law I represent a fellow who's company did some very interesting classified work\nFor an agency of the U.S government and I think he owned that particular hangar based on what I saw on TV last night\nHe wanted to sell his business to retire and that government agency had and shall we say and intense interest\nIn who the buyer might be that case got me my security clearance upgraded um I already had one and took me to the famous seven for or they certainly headquarters in Langley, Virginia very cruel experience and yes we completed the deal for\nNow did anyone come to Arizona to campaign or for you like the president did for Mick salad\nOh we're not just dripping down memory lane here I Want to use this as an example of how things have changed remember I spent nearly a year trying to persuade Washington Republicans\nThat our race was winnable and it was as they ultimately discovered a ultimately Robert Bork a came in after he had been rejected by the Senate for the Supreme Court he was still a big headliner\nUm and he spoke at a large rally for me and Oliver North colonel Oliver North tried to come here on my behalf he was very much in the news back then\nBut North Sea bass was scheduled at the Phoenician resorts at a time when someone who I regard basically as a crutch personal opinion build cheating owned the place or he supported my opponent and at the last minute he refused to provide security for the event\nA Norse life was being threatened by the uh Nicaragua contras among other people\nOr the orange for or whatever it was a deal that he was in effect on 'em so he canceled he cancelled the best side got literally was a publicized phone call from vice president Bush's he literally literally full flew over Arizona on his way to an event in California\nSo winning the final weeks of find a couple of weeks of the campaign that become a ... became abundantly clear to the people in Washington that what I had been telling them all along was true that we can win the RMC Republican National committee jumped in with a few commercials but by then it was too absolutely I'm\nReal quick don't forget please give us a call at for you know six zero nine Ninety nine hundred to request your

E. G. R. E. E. N. dot com\nAnd to the show will be posted and I think we had a particularly interesting first half of we're talking about Martha mix Sally\nOr some past experiences that I've had\n'em as a former U.S on a candidate and um I think you'll find it very interesting so why is this time different look\nIf you look back to the Nineteen sixties and what's changed since then it does provide some clues to us as to whether or not we're going to have the site sort of runaway inflation\nThat they experienced as a result of the Vietnam Era or deficits that we ran\n'em back then low unemployment high deficits both a consequence of the Vietnam War\nAnd that triggered a surgeon inflation there was a hostile relationship between\nA president or Johnson Lyndon Johnson and fed chairman William Mick Chesney Martin a that didn't help either so this is this business of the president complaining about the fed is not new news it happens almost all the time\nI'm back in sixty nine Johnson was saying man look my boys in Vietnam are dying and you're not printing enough money we need more money\nOr you'll recall that Lyndon Johnson or tried to wage war on Vietnam and I'm In Vietnam not on Vietnam in Vietnam\nUm the war we would have one we did not lose it on the ... we lost on the Potomac that's a whole different show um this'll marine says um\nBut he was trying to wage war in Vietnam and on poverty at the same time all the massive Lyndon Johnson I'm a welfare programs at the time\nNo contrast that with two thousand and here we have low unemployment high deficits and once again a vocal critic White House um\nSo there's a lot of echoes from the previous period even so there'd been structural changes in monetary policy in labor markets so that this means this time around similar conditions on unemployment in deficits\nAre probably won't lead to the same results on inflation and this is important for us as investors because as investors one of the risk that we face when I talk about this at length when we conduct a serious a diagnostic meeting called the investment suit ability interview here\nUm we talk about the many risks that investors space and one of them as purchasing power risk later in life we certainly want our clients to be in a position where they can give themselves a pay raise\nThat is at least commensurate with the rates of inflation in the years ahead on in September this year the unemployment rate hit three point seven percent that's the lowest since December of Nineteen sixty nine now I might add that in sixty nine\nOr that was a time when the draft for the Vietnam War contributed to labor market tightened is high incidentally volunteer I was not drafted I was in a foxhole\nWhen I learned that my um draft number was three twenty which means I wouldn't have been drafted\nLucky may well I'm a ... but I look you know I had political ambitions than I wanted to serve my country\nI'm In twenty Eighteen the budget deficit is expected to come in and around four percent of GDP now reflecting not so much the attack the Trump tax cuts Trump tax cuts say that\nFast tent on Trump's tax cut Trump to okay I'm just I don't mean it literally son um it doesn't so much reflect that despite what the Democrats say as it reflects Congress's profligate spending we don't have a revenue problem we have a spending problem\nIn fact government tax revenues after the tax cut already exceeding expectations now in the late sixties the combination of war spending and an income tax cut even as\nLyndon Johnson was waging war on poverty and spending huge sums of money on programs or that did not work um the deficit their peaked it only two point eight percent and that was in Nineteen sixty eight\nUnless it down like a this week President Trump a instructed his cabinet members to each cut spending and their departments by five percent\nNow that probably plays well to looking into his conservative base but even if they can accomplish this only Congress can determine what is spent and we've had points in our history before where administrations were compelled", "show_name": "DeGreen on Investing", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "20"}
