your advisors put together I don't know ... in stocks maybe it's a combination of fixed income and your equities maybe it's divest you know some shares periodically maybe it's segmented out some in

make reasonable accommodations\nLike a box or step ladder for him to step on and then running back and forth so he's not gonna be able to run back and forth but here's the course we did what we could unless the law says they absolutely have to accommodate\nAnybody with de da\n... to this college I don't know if it's a public college probably not and for example public schools here are people who have disabilities or they have to be accommodated for example the kids in a wheelchair or the school is going to put ramps in\nAnd it gets pretty pricey\nSo um we're um I I Can't wait for this one I
