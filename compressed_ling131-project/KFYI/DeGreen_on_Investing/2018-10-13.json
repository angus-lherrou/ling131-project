major investment asset classes equities fixed income alternatives and cash\nNow in addition to maintain those sixteen portfolios\nAt D.C him we maintain a written defensive measures protocol we don't just track the behavior beach portfolio retract the behavior of each individual exchange traded fond or ATF in the portfolio\nWe don't go to cash lightly but in a position falls outside of the single three years standard deviation is the technical term and I'm not going to get into the weeds here on this but trust us is something we track\nI Will then consider taking the consider taking that position to cash now a lot of times it may happen and we see that's the short term blip we see that there's a lot of really strong underlying fundamental some technical that are going to pass it right back and so we won't go to cash even now\nOnly if I see a long term challenge ahead for that index for that entire index while I take that specific ATF position to cash now since may are developed markets outside the U.

they're sending out fluff pieces saying don't worry you'll be fine says do no longer like the ... ah those markets that we accidentally specifically we only exited\nUm non us develop markets and emerging markets those two positions that we had in our portfolios and again are more conservative portfolios have smaller bits of those in them are more aggressive portfolios had you know larger applications to them\nNo I Love those markets I absolutely loved those markets there valuations that is to say their price earnings ratios right now are terrific\nBut I Want to and I want us to get back just as absolutely as soon as possible but they face longer term challenges now now that they've\nFallen below the um volatility metrics that we defensively establish for each position\nNow that they've fallen below those metrics um [noise] I Believe that they face longer term challenges are and I don't believe they're going to go away for a while and in the meantime they could fall a further\n... and I want to point out one other thing too if I may\nI'm part of our ... passed a confidence in those markets was the rising tide effect\nAs the U.S does well the world tends to do well we have a unique confluence of events going on right now higher interest rates in the U.S meaning a much stronger US dollar\nWhich is a difficult for many emerging market countries and willing to talk about that\nKnow as you know Sam emerging markets are not the only people complaining about these rights so this is not new news but it's getting pretty serious the bottom line is that as much as I Love emerging markets in their current very attractive that market valuations\nI just don't see an early exit for them from the challenges that they currently face\nNow that they've fallen outside their acceptable range of volatility that we establish an advanced ...\nAnd we accept more volatility and this is it specific position than in any others I mentioned it's just time to keep our money
