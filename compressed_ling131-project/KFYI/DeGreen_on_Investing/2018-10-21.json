I Know that as a passenger on these flights\nBut landing safely at the end of the day once you get up in the air this whole thing is a really great I mean we can get you all the way above Miami but if we don't get you on the ground safely but it's pretty safe to say that we didn't really accomplish our goal here\nRight in landing is a lot more technical than when you're sitting up in crews and so how do we apply this to our retirement situation if you are now nearing retirement or getting into retirement right now\nYou're kind of landing right now you're the part of the flight where you're you're dropping down the landing gear and you're getting on the island approach right and you're talking to the tower now and you're trying to monitor your air speed and you're putting down your ...\nSend your checking your levels are we are we hire we low right we've got a flair as we get into the ground affect me get near the runway\nAll of these things are going to set it down we have to not slam those we'll down we have to set it down softly right we need to correct and crab into the wind if there's a cross wind user rather to balance it out I mean all these things I Know you're going John we get it you like flying I Do love flying the love aviation\nWhat point B and that's a critical part of the flight and for your financial planning for your financial road map you better have that strategist because just like on a flight how critical the landing is the landing is unbelievably important related to your retirement plan\nDo you have planned out how much risk you should have where are you in a ... income from should you Ross convert when are you taking Social Security do you need more growth not enough growth\nWhere do you position the assets should roll out of your retirement plan should you take the lump sum pension should you take the income stream all of these things and so much more are part of that landing and we've helped hundreds of people land successfully I mean that's the whole idea right that's what you rely on for your airline pilot\nI landed airplanes hundreds of times successfully and I got my passengers safely to the gate and I've done the same thing here Keystone and we'd love to do that for you if you're not sure exactly how you need to be landing the airplane\nCall us and get your retirement preview will break down exactly what that looks like for you and the numbers one hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty not again the numbers one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen I call my team right now\nAnd schedule your retirement map review will talk to you about how to land the airplane safely and it all starts with on that phone call my team is going to schedule a Fifteen minute phone call was one of our financial advisors that's what you're committing to call us right now\nYou're getting a roadmap a one page Taylor road map for your situation and you're committing to a Fifteen minute phone call one of our advisors who just wants to hear about your story and what's going on in your life how we can maybe help you and as I wrap up the last thing is enjoying the destination upon arrival maybe one of the most important things that we often don't map out\nIs once we get to our destination water our goals\nLike once we get to our destination what's the plan like what matters to us I talked earlier in the show about on a broader scale than financially like my road map in life as a Christian is the Bible and I know somebody was nice to have different face but\nI'm able to go back to that plum line on decisions big decisions in life\nAbout what we're going to be about as a family about what I'm going to instill in our children about where they're going to go to school about the way we're going to treat other people about the fact that we're going to adopt two older children from Ethiopia I like those sorts of decisions the fact that we get back\nTo charity water every year here accuse the whole part is we dig wells and villages in Ethiopia that's a huge part of what we do in our clients do we do that together with our clients here\nWell those are easy decisions when you have a map for how you're going to live your life and\nHey don't hear me saying that as as pompous at all like I Wish I could say that I that I Do that perfectly all the time and I follow my map all the time and I don't I Wish I did I don't make mistakes we all do right but it's a whole lot easier to know when we're off course when we have the map that's one of the beauties and a map is when we're off course we know we are\nIn life in my life when I'm off course it's real easy from I have to say hey\nYou're you're off year man and it's easier to say that 'cause she goes look here's our ... here's how we know we want to live here said what we want to give out and with your money you need to know when you're off course and if you don't have a map to begin with if you don't have your quote unquote Bible\nFor financial planning you know if you don't have anything that's really breaking down and\nAnd specifically stating how it is you're going to invest how you're going to land how you're going to just along the way how to prepare for your flight you're just as James talks about the Bible you're just blowing and tossing in the wind like a wave of the sea we want to give you clarity we want

urgent specifically my father has a timeshare if he leaves it to me can I say yes to the rest of the inheritance but noted that sure and what would I finished my record\nI don't think so you know you don't get I mean there's nothing in the world I mean how can you be forced to accept property and in the case\nIn a case of a A N good for you by the way to say no and the case of a time share that's not property that's a liability\n... that that's what it is so no you can just simply say uh you know whoever the trustee is say please do not transfer the property to my name I have no interest in being an owner of this property do whatever the hell you want with it but uh I'm done and\nAnd they go back again to the state somehow\nTheoretically they could but uh they're not going to they're not going to sue ... they're not going to sue the state or its they're going to walk away from it\nSuch a thank you very much okay yeah I mean I mean could they go after the state of course for breach of contract or do you stay does the money but then it gets interesting because I I guess theoretically the trustee would have to negotiate\nWith the time share company to pay it off and get a get rid of it because you've got the time share company could sue the estate because he's still owes the money dead or not and\nUh but that would stop or the estate from being distributed\nBecause there has to be enough money put into that\nTo cover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a mess so timeshare companies normally just walk away or that's it you try to get him to walk away anyway but I mean the bottom line is you're crazy to get into a timeshare\nThat's for starters especially now with type shares because there are no longer you know on her own the property it used to be you'd say you at a time share you buy one week writer two weeks or you would own two parts of to let's say one fifty seconds\nOf the property there already is there is a deed you own property\nNow they just give you points you all nothing what you own is a contract in perpetuity\nWhere they have the right to raise maintenance fees every year every three years or whatever the contract says forever\n\nAnd inevitably does anybody actually use time shares once in awhile I run across someone that yeah loves the time share and yes thought it was the greatest deal but that's one out of all\nFifty maybe

right what's your question um how do I get my book that you are doing the right to\nI think so based on what you said because if he's the one that put it in a counter that if ah it it's not to\nThe bowl or it is susceptible to a ring around the counter\nA are based on mouthwash I mean you you're the one that just described it perfectly hey what do you expect there won't be a bottle of mouthwash on the counter what ... what did you expect you're the one that put in the wrong material and are\nThere are a now I don't know if you know this but if you go to one of these uh marvel yards these rock ... yards or counter or manufacturers put encounters there is was typically\nA anti mouthwash counters that you know that I Know I did there in there it is anti mouthwash counters I just made
