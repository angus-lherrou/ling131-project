investment advisors and the green and with me [noise] my father\nAttorney and certified financial planner Keith degree now we've been talking about the real volatility we've been seen in the markets and\nAnd how our portfolios have performed I'm and I'm I'm proud that you know obviously we are going to have losses from time to time but we have managed to reduce those losses I'm a\nWell below the loss of staying by the major industry so\nFar this month now dad you said you think the fed interest rate policy at the primary driver of today's pie do\nTurbulence yeah why is that well look look back and see how markets responded in advance to Trump's election it's very instructive they anticipated nothing had happened except he had gotten elected\nThey anticipated lower taxes possibly they weren't sure where whether we'd get lower taxes but they at least anticipated less regulation and more friendly business environment that's really all they could count on at the time markets shot up on election night\nUh well before the president took office and they continue to rise in anticipation of those pro business developments now look at that interest rate policy recently\nFed chairman a drone policy said that the fed would raise rates until they reach what he calls neutral\nNeutral is the point at which interest rate levels neither slow the economy Norris for inflation the problem is\nMr Paul freely admits that the fed doesn't know what the real neutral rate is in fact us interest rates they think it's maybe three and a half three Seventy five they don't know\nIn fact you that the fed funds rate incidentally\nIn fact us interest rates are already slowing the world's a world economy for sure our interest rates have slowed the world's economy\nMoney has been sucked out of emerging markets for example as investors seek the safety of higher rate us treasuries the spreads are ridiculous but listen to this post the annual yield on the ten year German bond that's the bond is a ridiculous thirty five bases points\nThat you earned it correctly tenure German Government bonds pay about one third of one percent interest per year\nEven in Italy whether he was all bent out of shape about their budget their tenure yield is just three point four four percent after shooting up\nMeanwhile in the U.S our ten year old is now it's three point zero seven six and that's down from a recent high of three point to three percent so again I think it's important that we we we explain why the u._s. yields had been declining it's temporary\nDuring the stock sell off that's all it's about people seek safety and vibe on the offer price increases due to demand so the declines pretty simple supply and demand has markets recover that is as equity markets recover\nReal quickly resume tenure yields in the three and a quarter range and a bug in my opinion and that's the problem there are signs that parts of our economy is slowing\nReal estate single family home Star Trek down mortgage applications for existing homes are down\nAnd on just real sector or reports of declining world demand a due to an overvalued dollar in a in a world economy that is starting to slow a slightly in fact there was something over the wires here just as we were starting to show and I wanted to read to you is from the Bloomberg\nUp a wire [noise] um\nThe most straightforward evidence the tighter conditions that's interest rate conditions are at the center of The Tempest is in rate sensitive groups like homebuilders and banks\nBuilding companies have tumbled and nine of the past ten weeks as higher borrowing costs contributed to disappointing housing data this is straight off the wires\nBanks normally beneficiaries of higher rates have slumped Fifteen Percent on concern rising financing costs have cramped loans so yeah banks profit when rates go up because they have a wider", "year": "2018", "show_name": "DeGreen on Investing", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "27"}
