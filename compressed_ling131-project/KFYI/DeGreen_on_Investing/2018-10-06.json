five PM popular blood pressure drugs could doubled the risk of leg amputations know anybody who's on high blood pressure drugs are taking drugs for blood pressure\nI'll bet a lot of them don't realize that there is a drug that they may be taking that may increase the risk of leg amputations will have that also burgers and hot dogs increase breast cancer big study brand new study out of Harvard is saying so if you know anybody who consumes a burgers\nAnd hot dogs and they have brass they may want to tune into the show tomorrow afternoon starting at five PM as we go nationwide those are just some of the topics were going to get into will have a course this week since all of the health outrage the weekend the health ministry of the week as well\nStyle I Want to allergic to the fact that the cabin of vote is going to be coming down within about a half hour from right now so keep\nGlued to your radio right here on news talk five fifty KFYI and you'll know the results of the vote which I understand a foregone conclusion but will say that maybe some surprises who knows it's coming up right here\nSo stay with news talk five fifty KFYI and until we talk again making a healthy Dana healthy week\nGood people um and it's tough these days because you see I we're witnessing first hand what can happen to a good person\nOr just because they are approaching a level of success that some people don't want to see them achieve\nThere's also another month before the election so expect the Democrats to manufacture another crisis with the White House\nBetween now and then as they try to make the election a negative referendum on Trump now this doesn't fly\nIn our solidly Republican congressional districts which we tend to have here in Arizona although there's a couple of them never you know down in Tucson for example we have a young woman\nUm use analyses I'm so sorry I forget her name right now Republican candidate and uh I Know we've done a little bit to try to contribute to her campaign and I hope she does well but that's a that's going to be a tough race on this doesn't fly in are usually solidly Republican congressional districts here\nAre but it can make a big difference in split districts\nSo keep an eye on that there'll be more of this kind of bologna between now and election day and a final no\nUh you know for what it's worth I'm especially concerned for judge Kavanaugh safety until at least after he's sworn in\nI'm Sam you were telling me that his house has been vandalized and yet um yeah they were raped all over his garage doors and spray paint [noise]\nYou know who's going to compensate them for ... who's going to want to buy a house even if he moves [laughter]\nYou know because people these idiots are going to split aside studios are gonna think he's still there will they threw fecal matter at his house to Cuba is a very well they're they're full of that so they probably have plenty of ammunition might look at it that way\nUm unfortunately he's not going to get sworn in I'm told oh I've heard a until Monday or Tuesday by the White House and I would like to see them get that accelerated\nUm and just get him to work you know so that this thing can die down I'm now ... what happens if we have a Republican president and the Democratic house well if we're lucky in my opinion if we're lucky the house Democrats remember this is all about the impact on investing\nA the house Democrats are going to attempt to appease Trump and I cannot think of a better way to ensure a Republican sweep and the twenty twenty election then if they do that\nYou know with both senators McCain and flake gone after the new Congress to see that I don't see any way that the Senate Republican majority would back now an impeachment vote\nNow historically this is what's so interesting\nSince Nineteen forty six markets have perform better under a Republican president anti Democratic Congress\nThen under any other scenario now some of that's coincidental and\nHas a sign of the times and so on but it's very interesting now we're going to have more on that in a in the coming coming segment now in historical terms as you were saying what might we expect this coming year well according to research from a a ... a strategic securities that's the name of the group\nThe U.S in the five hundred this is interesting has not declined in the year after mid term election since the Nineteen forty six cycle\nAnd its climbed on average you ready for this Fifteen Percent\nIn the third year on average of a president's term regardless of which party won or lost control of Congress with the market's doing somewhat better if there is a Republican president and a Democratic Congress go figure\nNow in comparison to the indexes average annual gain in every year going back to Nineteen forty six is eight point eight percent and then has slumped in twenty of those years and that's according to Dow Jones a market data\nNow some of this may be because historically\nDuring the third year the president's term administration has tried to propose and then implement popular economic reforms that boost the economy especially if they've just lost one or both houses of Congress course\nA President Trump just it was blind to the season's going to keep doing what he's doing\nAnd it's great uh what he's doing you don't have to love approve of some of his antics to really be enthusiastic about not only is agenda how he's getting it done yeah I Know that's not to say that the Republican loss of Congress might not spark some short term volatility\nAnd but we do have tail wins and I'll talk about those\nHere in just a moment sure but don't forget to give us a call at Ford oh six zero nine Ninety nine hundred to request your objective
