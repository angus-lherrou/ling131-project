would like to schedule that call one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine call right now as we near the end of the show here I Want to provide a recap because I think these questions before indicators\nOn whether you should be considering a different advisor are so important and by the way this doesn't mean that all roads lead the Keystone while partners I don't think we're the only good for him out there in fact I have personal relationships with other advisors here in the area that are great they fit what I'm sharing with you right now they do a good job\nBut unfortunately many of you are working with folks that don't do a great job they don't fit these things these indicator lights are just going off right now in your head and because of maybe a loyalty biased with the fact that you've known them a long time or whatever it may be you're unable to maybe make that jump but I Want to recap for you again what are the four indicators really think this through\nYou can go to our website anytime a Keystone wealth partners dot com\nAnd ask for retirement map you remember my team will call you back\nThat business day or if you do it over the weekend if you do it right now we'll call you back Monday morning and learn more about your situation Cuba here's the Fort indicators really think these are this is your life savings the first is is your person a fiduciary\nAre they with a registered investment advisory firm or they with a broker dealer do they sell you products on behalf of those brokers or are they operating legally within your best interests at all times that's what a ... that's what a CPA is that's what we are here at Keystone\nYou should expect that if you're going to get advice and ask what you should be doing with your life savings or are they ... the first indicator second indicator are you getting comprehensive tax planning advice\nHas your advisor looked at your tax return or ask to see it in the last year\nIf they haven't we already know you need to upgrade your advisor fire them and find someone else that doesn't have to be Keystone but find someone else your taxes are far too important and we just had the biggest tax reform since Reagan how was your financial advisor and I'm putting up air quotes not asked\nTo see a return number three is your strategy understandable\nCould you explain it on the back of an apt into one of your friends or do you think about your strategy do you say well no I mean it's so complicated I I just have no idea it shouldn't be complicated it should be simple and easy to understand that for you to articulate and communicate\nTo one of your friends because by the way that's actually what provides clarity and confidence for you when you actually have an understanding\nOf what you're doing with your money and the last thing number four is is this an advisor who is an expert in retirement and the circumstances and situations that arise related to retirement I just use that example of a new kind of our Syracuse don't doing uh Seventy two tea\nIt allows us to take equal systematic withdrawals from IRAs before fifty nine and a half and not pay a penalty this gentleman\nAnd both of those charges and failure felony first degree animal cruelty I'm convinced ... a conviction is a two year jail sentence or can included junior jails and ... at a thousand dollars and it's a first violation and the forfeiture of ants\nHoles in possession and a permanent ban on owning any similar animals so why he if he has dogs or any kind of pets are no longer a you can no longer own or any other kind of pet like that particularly dead beavers\nAnd it's just one of those very strange cases the case\nOf sex with a dead beaver no it's not fair because it ... beeper was probably alive when he was having sex with it\nOkay enough of that when we go ahead and take a phone call fair enough sure\nSam Hi Sam welcome to handle on the law\nGood morning I Am a truck driver\nAnd I have a question concerning whether or not I'm a contractor or employee [noise]\nUm and I've never on my own truck I worked for sure uh solely for one company [noise] and uh where I worked for the orientation they had me sign a ten Ninety nine for him and I was wondering if that's what are you going nope nope nope nope nope\nIt use you it is it since you work for the company and they own the truck your employee and do they determine where you deliver and do they determine your hours that's sort of thing exactly oh you are so you are so an employee\nRight and what happened is I got hurt last year and there are ... what was that I was a contract signed up for no it\nDoesn't matter uh it's do you 'cause you're are you a that's fighting for them was pure coercion that they wouldn't give you a job unless you find it there in violation of law big time so you are entitled\nTo workers' comp disability and they're going to get nailed you about just make a a complaint to the labor board and they were going to get nailed beyond nailed\nAll right and one last question the fact that the beaver got hit by the car was that a mitigating factor and the guy trial\nNo it was not he hasn't been try he hasn't been tried yet [noise] ... not a he's a yeah and what makes it even worse with the beaver is I understand it was a particularly ugly beaver\nI mean I can see a good looking fever even have attraction to good looking deeper but an ugly beef or no I don't think so ... Victoria oh no let's Eddie is supposed to use for a moment Eddie hello\nYes\nI'm a I'm about to get into my wife and at this point in time that I'm about to get out but I think that we've been together\nA thing about a month by that if I ever buy something right now saying that way I feel that require that well\nYes and she's obligated but that doesn't mean she's going to\nBecause what you want to do is ah you're relying on her agreement in writing\nTo uh go ahead and change ah I changed titled the house or allow the uh the ... [noise] uh but the bottom line is uh you can't force her\nTo sign all you can do is sue her after the fact that she does ... maybe you can get a now I don't think so a court order this going to force her to sign but I don't think so I think\nIf she changes are mine she changed her mind and you let her know inch snow uncertain terms that if she just changed your mind she's bought herself a world of litigation\n[noise] but I wouldn't be able to her I think so I Would ever damages yeah I think so okay All right yeah\nAnd you hate her anyway so what difference does it make All right now Victoria Hi Victoria\n[noise] I get money I had an a or writing or reading a tech communication which are not doing\nYou're talking about right you're talking about ... basically driving while texting right\nYeah okay but not All right and they're very well nation wide I don't actually came back and I did up at my yeah\nAnd I don't know for not having my ... like in my possession id late and giving the graphic like them but I get on there is also a good reason for that and it's a matter of whether or not a judge will pay my rent or below me off\nThat's exactly correct It's a matter of whether the judge will see a will look at you and believe you were not believing so what is what is your question\nMy question is ... ... number one what are the possible that I could have\nJust showing court exactly what you said you plead not guilty and you explain why you're not guilty okay\nAnd they're gonna put the cop on the stand who's going to probably do a whole different story and it's up to the judge to determine who is telling the truth and who isn't\nActually the second part I'm In Africa and the jurisdiction of choice like corrupt or not you know let the Abbott\nAnd that's no that's not corruption that saw just notoriously believing officers versus leaving drivers\nWell sure and that is by the way most jurisdiction because here's a philosophy you have every reason to lie because you have all the skin and again a cop theoretically has no reason to lie use objective\nSo from the beginning you're going up hill\nYeah All right so all you can do is tell your story and say this is the reason and this is why I'm not\nGuilty and CNN and you know judges do believe that once in a blue moon so we'll see what happens [noise] this is handle\nOn the law breaking news as it happens real news in

it and you're what you're saying you could negotiate it yourself and you don't think they did much right yeah All right so they have any recourse oh yeah you consume in small claims court saying they didn't do anything they just let it lapse and you\nCome away I requested documentation they haven't that me\nAnd they will they will as soon as you file a lawsuit in small claims court for your seven thousand dollars oh trust me they're going to come up with documentation because you're saying they did nothing and they're saying oh you don't deserve any money back because we did something in your question is okay let's see it\nAnd if they didn't do anything I mean uh their letters negotiations but if they they did or didn't do as you said I Can't imagine you're not going to get your seven thousand dollars back\nOkay small claims court but yeah the right absolutely what did you get into a time share in the first place because I was an idiot guys very well say I'd die you beat me to it well said\nMy man identity [noise] if you're young lady yes ma'am I'm can you hear me yeah\nUm I had been working for a school district and so Cal for sixteen years um I'm part time actually it's a lesson part time and they've done that for this reason\nI'm I'm getting ready to retire [laughter] when I had taken um days off for being sick and the whole sixteen years generally taken a few and and put them on the books are sick days [laughter] but um mostly I've accumulated I'm thinking that I could\n... them at the end either take a pay out or um take time off prior to my retirement I'm looking into it we're getting ready to retire this year um I have over three hundred and twenty five hours accumulated and I can't take any of it\nAnd why can't you take any of it on the same because I Am part time work to less than twenty hours on it so what's your question do I have any recourse at all\nI didn't know if if the policy of the school board and the policy in which you hired is that\nPeople were under twenty or twenty five hours a week or month whatever it is or not entitled to take their sick pay\nAt the end of it uh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy\nAnd some school boards some companies allow people to take sick days my police departments for example usually do\nSo uh you got cops that retiring literally a year's worth of sick leave that they pull out early and then there are companies and uh there are introduced to say no for example uh my my company this anniversary good parenting\nIt's using or lose it Mm same thing uh I worked for this radio station it to use it or lose it\nAnd they said the only recourse I could have is if I had because I'm part that if I took a different um government job that was over twenty hours\nRight well I mean whenever the policy is\nYeah then it could it 'cause it stays with me I guess\nOkay but it's whenever the policy is you have to live within the policy and it is perfectly legal to have a policy that says use it or lose it\nYeah as which I Do and not only do I haven't my company uh but I also live under it\nYeah yeah well yeah you're screwed I congratulations so there is no case you're\nA new

[noise] um\n[noise] if this turns into like a big problem in the future or something I could take my landlord with small claims court about\nMaybe by the the first thing you're going to argue is you're not responsible negligent or what does that mean I don't know is it what can you do that would cause the plumbing issue rather than block up a toilet for example were ... I don't even know other than that\nBlock up a sink or a toilet or what pipes undoing it's a soldering on ah just unraveling so I don't quite get it and that did you sign the agreement with a new company\nKnow how to find a ... that's too bad and you say no thank you I'm not saying I'm not accepting this\n... cloud leasing agreement or a certain seem to be a contract or anything it's just like grain to the rules\nBut they're changing the rules that you say I don't agree to it now if the board says you're agreeing to what you've agreed to it\nOkay All right and so I don't know if they're asking for individual owners or they're going through the uh the ... board if you ...
