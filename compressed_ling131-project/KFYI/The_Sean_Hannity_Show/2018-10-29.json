one week from tomorrow that was the president talking about the Pittsburgh should have gone to synagogue shooter\nUm we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert Bowers and who he is he was a very ill an anti Semite\nHe was a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know to keep for saying what that means maybe and we talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings where the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those says we continue rose cannon I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long run to the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nOr you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rows of very very sorry or thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes beat my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is shining you or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood\nI go there to shop and to dying and in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the neighborhood is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities\nAnd as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's ... that you brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I I got sick thinking that this is starting to become political and\nIt's in you can count the seconds there's an interesting side note that there is no brothers to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turning against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful\nColumn that he put out linking the demands to go to the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan I'd never ever get in a room with the dishes racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged with ... and\nObama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we've had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump more recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nYeah ... ... any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump president as many bone in his body is that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out\n... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr Eric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrakhan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater I get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate\nAbomination what climate dizzy away just for the press release\nSome of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ... praises resume Oday\nUh terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she's been praised by Christ in dealing with a Democrat she hasn't praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter and those things matter a great deal\nAs it should be expected when you normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expected\nWell the way that I Would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic Cade he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism in any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson and Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd trying to find may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because\nI I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate right here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hat and they said that you yourself called the\nWho went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more\nThese are the real stories and this is the truth these were not acts of a nation divided that's what the ones that the way the media wants to believe\nThat we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it just makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said\nHe said the bullet holes are too numerous to count but we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been here one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off them branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nSo that Sean is who we are and date as a nation I Know you agree that we are as a nation we are not invited\nHim and the ... most of us or not but the blame game ... interest time yes and it's All right well thank you both again a rose our thoughts and prayers to all our friends in Pittsburgh and to the community in the synagogue and the rabbi\nPlease send more loving in regards and our prayers\nUm eight hundred nine four one showing toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program eight days till election day how do we get out the vote was going to deal with that all the other issues of the day threats against Republicans that the media just outright ignores\nAnd the mob mentality continues will have full full chronicling of all of this as we continue eight days till election day the best election coverage available on your radio dial\n\n\nIt will be heading for from the KFYI newsroom I'm Deborah Dale the White House calling the attack in Pittsburgh synagogue an act of hatred\nAnd evil comment was made it a briefing by press secretary Sarah Sanders is President Trump prepares to visit Pittsburgh tomorrow details of who he'll meet with and we're all go haven't been released yet\nAnd an emotional statements Sanders says the nation mourns the loss of eleven extraordinary people who were killed in the shooting attack\nAccused synagogue shooter Robert powers has his first court appearance us attorney Scott Brady lays out the charges he faces\nOn Saturday or over twenty seven twenty eight seen my office charge Robert ... hours with federal murder assault charges relatives of the river acts of violence he committed the tree of life synagogue\nBowers is being held without bond if convicted he could face the death penalty\nThe suspect accused mailing pipe bombs to some high profile critics of the president had his first court appearance today\nSuspect say sorry say Iraq faces charges including threats against former presidents and illegally mailing explosive materials today officials said they intercepted another suspicious package addressed to CNN from a postal facility in Atlanta\nIt's not known if it was male by ...\nAnd it looks like we'll be getting a Trump visit in the valley this week not the president though political reports that Donald Trump junior is coming to the valley on Thursday to campaign for Republican Senate ...

Sean our number you want to be a part of the program Ralph Reed is back with us a he is the founder of the chairman of the faith and freedom\nCoalition and CEO of of century strategies and look he was part of the Christian Coalition back in the day when they paid played such a powerful force in American politics in many ways he has rebuilt the Christian Coalition in terms of\nGetting out mailers and and making contacts with voters all around the country key races\nNow in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both the Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and run to the census was a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle of people showing up in the panhandle\nYou had a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill ... and we have British students team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really has taken people back also on tape staffers for breakfast and calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get out the vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against the phony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically is just like Obama but she too like Brett as soon as hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota's down by double digits she also was exposed by project Vera ... uh we now have in a Brown in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe Donnelly a Democrat\nThe only the only factor there that I really see is there's a libertarian that's drawing votes away from\nThe Republican so if you're in Indiana don't vote libertarian or else that's like a half a boat for Donnelly we've got to hold the seat held her seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then Arizona I have no idea why poll came out this weekend showing Christian cinema the Democrat up\nOn war hero twenty eight year veteran\nSix tours of duty Iraq and Afghanistan Martha McSally especially with cinema calling the people of Arizona crazy\nAnd saying Arizona's the\nMeth lab of democracy and inviting\nThe attorney for the blind shake to Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven I was perfectly fine of Americans want to join the enemy and joined the Taliban I don't have a problem with it anyway he believes that he can help get out the vote Ralph Reed is with us that's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nIdeas Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million evangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on a million nine hundred and seven thousand two hundred twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day we think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had in mid term elections\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide ear\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats and two oh five Republicans at two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignore the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nAnd everybody around me you know I make a living for people not ignoring mining law\nYou're accepted okay by it but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nCitizen through Z ask\n'em and you could see CNN fake news and\nAnd that mess that they're just desperate and they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision where Republicans get seats in the Senate\nBut below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half of Oprah below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for below sea ensure\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know the different polls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president\nWe have a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me she was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids bay filled an arena\nThat we're over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on the jumbotron they stayed there to show their support you simply cannot quantity\nOf quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nOr a quick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed

chairman of the faith and freedom\nCoalition um and I think that the ... look there are many factors I think Kavanaugh is\nPlaying a part in this I think the Democrats none of them have spoken at all about the caravan their silence is deafening and they'll say is well Republicans talking about it means that they're they're racist and seen a phobic it no it just means we believe in the rule of law\nAnd we're not going to wait the four weeks so you\nKnow seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up\nA Republican headquarters in Florida we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressmen\nHave an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota or there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\nYeah and I think anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of pervasive dark the most important thing that you can do is light a candle and I think what people have got to do is they've got to resist that hate with a love for their country a love for their fellow man\nAnd hope for a better future for all of our citizens stay positive stay prayer full and work hard you know I when I was coming up Sean and me

be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nUh a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knocked down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear that that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around that\nTo do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given\nSpecial consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend in a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis sees a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole column ... my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the mark I mean there was actually good actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks from my party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's elected who basically tried to uh overthrow the constitutional make himself or presidents for life they are in bed with the Venezuelans\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to let the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that well\nI mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people that the and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity as mountain seemed to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws come in according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply ... to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just added stuff if that's the principal well\nWhat I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be\nGiven the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on a ... percent we don't want it to her and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to us\nOn the look probably been lied to the beginning I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nUm so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply lose HUD ugly as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country and\nTimes and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nOn the other side and Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know a million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego and if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and\nAnd ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people but we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd I really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere without question of what you just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the border that we are supposed to allow three to ... billion people move here\nBecause that is what you were actually talking about\nIf you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion\nObviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of you know\nAll right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program we got to take a break up right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections that turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four O. one K. is that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com they're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax\nKnock on doors help neighbors get to the polls\nGo to a big choice election dot com because the only way we lose this year is if you don't show up if you don't turn out go to big choice election dot com do your part\nAnd let's not get out worked in November big choice election dot com will come back for your phone call straight ahead eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number [noise]\nOh yeah right here and get out of a media man around\nDoing [noise] Shaun\nHannity show they inform\nUnder the law we must present this case to a federal grand jury within thirty days of today our thoughts and prayers continued to be with the victims families and with the community and rest assured we have a team of prosecutors working hard to ensure that justice is done\nPowered spaces twenty nine charges in the shooting that killed eleven people and injured six more it's believe prosecutors will seek the death penalty\nMale bombing suspect seizure say apple remain behind bars for the time being he's accused of sending pipe bombs to several high profile targets he appeared in court today facing charges that include threats against former president and the illegal mailing of explosives\nUnderstanding we'll focus on evaluating the heart and lung health of wild land firefighters FEMA awarded at one point five million dollar grant to the University of Maryland for the one of the kind three year study researchers will look at how wild land fires smoke my foot firefighters at risk for such things as cardiovascular disease\nI look at your money sponsored by money matters with Ken morays now closed down two hundred and forty five points to twenty four thousand four hundred and forty two KFYI news time three thirty one\nHalfway I coverage Somali when he died last night traffic here's me power\nIn Scottsdale there's Iraq when it went south bound or the Indian school at the autograph also a crash on the ... found a twenty four straight couple of service St ... done one of those on Cape creek roaches\nAlpha greenway in Iraq I union hills drive just east of I Seventy four traveling for oh two five fifty KFYI for\nThis report is round you buy guns et cetera Saturday November third only it's the guns et cetera once a year anniversary sales of and there's only one day I hear you can receive these unbelievable me it'll still be ten thousand two hundred square feet of deals all over the store had guns et cetera and makes it on Saturday November third only\nTwo six eight to gold or online at R.

twenty five now till the top of the hour a there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they have narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words it we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians cinema can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest poll is beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exact even tie forty six all\nNelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRhonda Santa's is coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his\nThe latest habit now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll of West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seen is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of\nCommissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say this shot first off thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every quarter of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went through the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we got Heidi Heitkamp will unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns\nSaying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing in the case of Tennessee got reticence staff calling the people in Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day are Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry at least Sean and the less not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media had two scenarios out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hillary won in the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still one\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that the two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten ... mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase to regulate its watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now
