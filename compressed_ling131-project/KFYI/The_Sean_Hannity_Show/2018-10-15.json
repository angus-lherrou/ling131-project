anything to the level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know when you're a scientist your scientists have long said disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nMight have he said now I've seen the hurricane situations I changed my mind that really as climate change and I thought wow what an impact [noise]\nWhen when I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about that in the news they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than going just said was Michael says that they say I mean they say and what about the scientists say it's worse than having\nA show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda us like cancelling them just also have a political agenda\nWhere was that angle of the the altered climate change data it's science\nWas as the Al Gore and others would tell you if it was so surely perfect there's no disagreement and the scientific community it's just not sure why would they have to alter the data back at that time\nBy the way the job of started listening and he heard that he's about to lose his mind or am I why do I know and the president was down visiting the devastation left by Michael ... hurricane you call that a thousand percent right I think up to now we've lost Nineteen people is the latest number I've heard but\nYou know thankfully most people listen and got out\nA job of stories with weather bell dot com that that annoyed you I Know right\nOff of all of my my interviews the ... she went to debate the president she didn't want to interview the president she wanted a debate\nFirst of all agree inland folks the last two years Greenland has had near record snowfall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold\nPeriods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties and nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process for the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal skillful\nAnd near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking ... record breaking high about five six years ago and they came down below and they're back your normal now let me let me say this the president answer the question perfectly here's why\nUp until now\nClimate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change the climate is always change naturally until now people are saying that now it's man that's doing it how\nIt is not questioning it make any sense in other words if you were just apply only accept something after ten million years every single time it was natural now or\nYou know whether they ever anybody else better than anyone else I mean okay but when you look back at the earth temperature as it got a cooler and then warmer in the warmer than cooler\nIt has so questioning it questioning authority is what he's doing and that's his background that's why now let me let me give Leslie for if if she lets thing if you're unless they will give you for example to intensify bore rapidly that Michael right off the top of my head\nNineteen thirty five hurricane went from a tropical storm to a category five and thirty six hours hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine\nCame eleven days across the Atlantic is a tropical wave\nForty eight hours later a category five hurricane fill your with a hundred and eighty miles an hour wind gusts Corpus Christi went from a hurricane a category one to a category four in the twenty four hours coming into Corpus Christi Nineteen Seventy\n... in Nineteen sixty nine when over ... light ship with a hundred and twenty five mile an hour winds thirty six hours before fifty mile an hour tropical storm and that's way up in the north Atlantic they're countless examples\nAre paid by thinking about this the top three percent pay the majority of everything the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes and literally than the bottom Ninety percent one percent pays more than Ninety\nPercent the top fifty percent paid all the taxes Ninety seven percent we have redistribution the bottom fifty percent of Americans only pay three percent of the bill that's it\nThe individual income tax system is designed to be progress if it is it is redistribution of wealth we already have the system and then when you get a little bit of your ... back because the ... the only ones that are getting ... back or people that pay\nYou know but for the middle class that's a lot\nOf money one and two thousand dollars in to say you want the crumbs back is ridiculous\nSo there's a lot going on this election and twenty two days\nNow I Would argue that what your tax savings is on the ballot\nThe American economy is on the ballot are great comeback is on the ballot jobs are on the ballot your kids jobs in future is on the ballot your wages and for one case that's on the ballot your business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nIn all the biggest challenge is who's in charge of the future is it going to be ... or you going to elect and get to continue the Trump agenda go to tax cuts work dot com\nAnd they'll help you make it easier to make calls and emails text knock on doors the only way we lose is if you don't show up in twenty\nTwo days tax cuts work dot com so you can do your part and never want to get out worked before November quick break right back we'll continue\nOn that it'd be pretty can use as an avid real views in real time he was talking five fifty KFYI\n\nHi Michele I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I reported on with the trial of abortion doctor ... now I Will be woman goes you know when it comes out there and there's\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a federal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton the paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this can be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so\nJason shape it's is with us former congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller the deep state\nHave Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us a thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to earn force that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the DEA Jay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also militarized themselves with is mark and why it marked why it was ...\nHe was ... for the DNC he was counsel for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers on and I hope Jason you're talking to your former French and telling them to get them a get hit in to the Congress to take this ad and\nI don't care if they're not going to\nUm ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't have our own minds you didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday\nThat I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nAh Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some ... but let me just say this 'cause this is really important\nAll the names that you heard Michael ... Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress hasn't and clear issue any subpoenas court we now know that the FBI or\nAm I fix and that you see a cue\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was in fact conversations of George ... were intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation\nThey found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information to the by the court\nKnow it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the ...\nNow is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testify that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there is no there are there and then all of a sudden we find the media elites strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in\nAnd what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that the CIA information is leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaky so that they can appoint the special counsel so then the which one could be good begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nThat would have favorite George Papadopoulos they hit it from the by the court there is no doubt\nThat number people John granted James Clapper on down all the way into the White House committed crimes and that Jeff Sessions\nAnd Rod Rosenstein cannot figure out a way to do that and by the way John cue or a Utah at the head ...\nDoing nothing six months without a report I let you read the budget and die tomorrow use what an outrage with Joe that she had been ... by ... I Do the credits waited till after the election to get rid of them and I say to hell with both of them All right\nThank you what's going to happen Jason ... you see a new attorney general down their own\nSoon enough I just put up a piece that I wrote about sessions can't go soon enough worthless use their name only the really should be a ... a spec and professional ... to look into Brandon and all these cast of characters we've been talking about over the last few minutes they did the president needs that employees\nWell ear hair president making that decision himself\nYeah absolutely you could push that for a ... and and releasing the documents to Congress absolutely\nYeah I think all of that needs to happen uh orange twenty two days before the election we'll see what goes on from here\nA thank you all for being one of those eight hundred ... all one Sean toll free telephone number what happened to the Washington Post reporter uh Jamal should a cause showed the\nUm accusations that the Saudi crown prince is involved in the murder of this journalist will get into that also have the latest on the rioting that took place over the weekend both in Portland in New York City and much much more as we continue busy Newsday here on the Sean Hannity show only twenty two days till election day\n[noise]\n\n[noise] fireworks\nExpect this night as a candidate for US Senate in Arizona the fate friendly KFYI\nNewsroom ...

V. I. L. GB T. Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are the candidates said\nAnd then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who are told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia\nWell that's good to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp telling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote and Georgia and said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants\nAnd adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in the gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Chris than a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... Sally one of the important races that were following and how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and\nAll the Washington Examiner apparently found the emails that shows cinema herself inviting a prominent group I'm not making this up of I'm reading from the Washington Examiner of feminist which is\nI'm not saying I'm suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse now how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of the there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you\nKnow we were ... they had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah yeah that's the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just that it's only the need to answer why they like the president on that you know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale\nAnd the thing that we don't know about it look like they didn't like it the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nAnd well okay you're going to happen I mean the the women I chronicled the lot on this program and ...\nWomen voting and driving et cetera and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up if you left if you went out in public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under the sharia there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWasn't modernization and Saturday we felt when then being able to drive with other ... what the route that the government that I had to wear ... and that you were at high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major you see all\nThe people who dress observant link but it's such a great clean found that people aren't talking about what you just said is that it has been an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to ... for many years and and this and this new\nThey're all ... all relates to Judaism and Christianity and lesbians or either slogged or killed is not true\nAbsolutely him but that for me what's unfortunate about\nThis incident and why I Hope it gets corrupted very quickly is that we will actually modernization static thing look or you know a more liberal or much to women's rights limits education when driving and that played the crime rate had built up such good well around the world is because he was taking a different approach\nTo really saddens me to see them go so far backwards from what was really an interactive at last year to change things\nRight last for ...\nYeah Morgan's right they were trying to diversify the economy get away from us strictly Petro dollars and I mean this is an enormous enormous step back on you\nKnow there there there's no covering this up if they have to admit that they did this ... and\nThe details of this come out there's a risk because we think there's going to be some explaining to do I just encourage everybody to keep the whole global picture in mind here uh when doing it we can't start World War three over this although sub there has to be a some form of a upcoming clean by the Saudi some form of a of retribution there's no\nDown like they want to pass it on to people and the consulate and I don't believe for a second that they didn't know or at least the crown prince did no sooner than this uh All right thank you all pre shit it\nUh Morgan Ortega and are are good friend a dam bond Gino eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number next

I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all but I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now ...\nGet to walk the halls without what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations zone in that are\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and by the way all within the last ... and\nDo it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama the number one leave us kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I appreciate the early ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents\nAnd I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear it\nWay I don't need to but what I Would love you to play it again look first of all you're ignoring the fears of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all your your seem to be ignoring the examples that Donald Trump really\nWhen people were stood up protecting him saying I've got to hurt him if you you know I'll get you in court don't worry about it are you on TALK marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing has happened no nothing that I saw a sort of like well what I Will say oh no no no no no if you want me to the other question I didn't take that as it's the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing\nThat is now happening with the Democratic party and by the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama only play with ... ... you're talking about\nProtecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error you got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile I\nMissed the speakers you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah You're welcome\nSally called\n... ... ... here's what I think we agree on violence is that I Hope we both agree that the thing I was little and I have actually and written about it or you know Hillary Clinton's comments Eric Holder's using comment I spoken out about them and it gets so\nNow there is also a very very visible pattern Cohn at ... at at the comet of Donald Trump I'll beat the crap out of part of the problem is nobody wants to hurt you want it anymore and the good old days the rest of them I treat them very very rough\nFirst of all let it be fair about both sides in the Senate and go to this past weekend where you had to write we hate groups that by next several accounts book this weekend\nIn your effort to a point but as the ... slow
