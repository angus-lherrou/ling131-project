{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Yeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer at one of the authors of the study even said I'm not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitions air pollution death anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're messing with my beer and you know everybody's interested in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll this month of October I've been putting in little stories and the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween\nThat I Love to get every year the one that caught my attention this past week was that a child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery there was this eerie discovery ... they found it was the skeleton of a ten year old that had\nA rock lodged in his mouth they bury this child this way because they were afraid I was going to come back to life and contain the spread malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university that Stanford\nWent on this gig in Italy and they found this child cemetery and so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic\nRoman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside a limestone rocks\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said\nThey believed that child died as malaria\nSixty miles north of round and they said that the way that they buried this catalyst they ... they kid who was already dead they opened an ounce for ... to the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they\nCan be sure that the Iraq wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead 'cause of those same impression right locally or they're calling it the vampire of little nano it's in this ... like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called ... de ...\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in this very will say you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of a ... in the trenches they're covered trenches\nThere was a remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents toad bones ROMs called dreams these things were filled the ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist all these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that the where people and like I don't know how this would apply to children but it had violated society's rules and ... and ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why was popping up\nAnd things that they feared they thought might come back from the dead that thought they were vampires that's why they took these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nThey would do all kinds of things like that were\nOr we have representative John Ratcliffe\nAt talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying that indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a federal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele of foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason Chaffetz is with us\nFormer congressman now Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state\nWe have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of diGenova and Toensing with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your wheel house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issues to peanut when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ... he was counsel for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth and it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former friends and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress\nTo take that said and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got is the ... usa peanut first and then you negotiate later you don't say ooh minds you didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it went state and you make it there is\nThat I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials that Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... of warrants the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office or Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over ... painted materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important\nAll the names that you heard Michael ...\nMr liar Simpson or all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress hasn't and clear issue any subpoenas court\nWe now know that the FBI or am I stick\nAnd that you do you conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information\nWas fat conversations of George ... what\nWere your perspective and in the course of intercepting the compensation they found out that out the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there's no there there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that the CIA information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relief of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition\nUh transcribe under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these big go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information\nThey would do it that way\nVictoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just not fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also Victoria Toensing with us\nI Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done it again call

Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are\nThe candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who were told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia well that's good to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp telling Fox News that Abrams once the illegals to vote in Georgia\nAnd said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in the gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Christian a cinema now she's going up

department stores and gas stations you know maybe on the heels of nobody in the Democratic party condemning what happened up Pam Bondi here's the Nielsen the secretary of homeland security or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant or Mitch McConnell at an airport\nYou know it's just play a little bit of ah some of the marching orders\nYou cannot be criminal with a political party

you tell people to follow Pam Bondi and and Sarah Sanders family and and secretary Nielsen into restaurants and getting their faces and confront them and great a crowd and push back in ... is that

gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer is\nAh when I was an organizer you know before when I met him in the community organizer I used to organize protests like the scene are going to\nPeople's workplaces or you know not just the halls of Congress right which are that's where the people's businesses supposedly down but we're talking\nPeople's lawns cetera um you know look I support and a free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and then these protests those sorts of protest now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out against\nA you know going up to you know and it's costing people in restaurants or you know what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders et cetera\nI Do think you are I I Love you say you're dancing 'cause you're kind of ignoring you know I I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or not the crap out of them or you know maybe they should have been wrapped up or you know that that if we're talking about\nViolent rhetoric and we're going to look I think it's all bad but like ... rhetoric\nIs now the tax or the the heart of the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write you use to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correctly yes\nWhy would you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a role leave the women and children alone\nWell I I I haven't\nMet I mean maybe today that I don't know maybe it'll be accused on me and\nSome of those policymakers might be women don't leave the husband and children alone to where the partners whatever again John I'm not saying it a ... or some kind of bragging rights I'm saying it because I ... on that has changed\nBut we'll hire hearing out regularly ... these sounds to me like marching orders creator crowd push back followed them into gas stations department stores restaurants you see a cabinet member you go at him getting their face\nI'm I'm not hearing the Republican side and my point to you is this look I I think it's very hard to tie I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line and um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings\nDuring the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now hunger is get to walk the halls without what's now becoming I think a dangerous confrontations zone and other\nThan protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting hearing that by the way all within the last ... or ... to\nDo it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled my play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama that number one leaves kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents and I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear it\nWay I don't need to buy what I wouldn't want me to play it again look first of all you're ignoring the stairs of nonviolent protest the phone calls the petition that whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you have your seemed to be ignoring the examples that Donald Trump really\nWhen people were stood up protecting him saying well I got to hurt him if you get out and

C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big\nRedistribution

trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I'm king corroborate doesn't only telling you what the New York post and and the British newspapers are reporting\nOn one Turkish newspaper if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet\nAnyway returned to Riyadh on Tuesday I had a plan in search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took the show gave this uh parents that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show he but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nThe source told the site that his dad took seven minutes forensic physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi

several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to have close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nThey have a pro government newspaper reporting that quiz show these apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out in body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and\nYou have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is

to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs

nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal was born well she does have to get re elected a senator or she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American\nWe can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the directory of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage she was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThey and tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want or elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nTo shine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm you know Scott Brown won when he ran together with\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush um\nWhen Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House twenty twenty", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "21"}
