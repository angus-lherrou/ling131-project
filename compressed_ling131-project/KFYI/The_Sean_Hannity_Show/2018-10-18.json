I think honestly rush that the Democrats plan is anarchy because they don't have a plan I think they they are just\nVerbal already that throws everything against the wall the sea sick because do you remember the or\nThe science fiction film Forbidden Planet\nMm years I rent me where I made earlier\nWas like a a ... a monster that was made of energy that that was conjured up by this man I there was Walter pigeons brain and every time they attacked it it grew in straight it absorbs all that energy\nAnd that's basically what Trump is he absorbs all the energy just makes me stronger\nIt makes the people that support Jim are digging their heels even even further down and it makes president war how comfortable and confident because\nHe's used to being attacked and it doesn't faze him you know and um I just think that the Democrats right now or in a point where they just are in a in a like a a fever and they can't figure out how to get this guy and they're going to throw anything and everything\nI Do I I I I Do think that they are seriously folks I don't I'm not saying this to be funny or outrageous to call attention to myself I\nIn Nineteen days we can create a system of health

you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whatever I Need to say to get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them then go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win if they define who they really are they can't win if they give us their true agenda\nThey can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five and Pete forty five impeach forty five are claiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it when I'm ... now I don't want to talk about\nIt just don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment endless never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now you have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want to open borders through they calculated that is going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold on to power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline site Cannae hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they weren't open borders so that they think that

I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a meal is street violence\nA which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative when you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I it everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as the pension his intention to for better trade deals freer fear or deals\nYou know I think well I think he is the fourth oh cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd is often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater or fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the love crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and and the and I think that just further isolates from\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously have a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare I'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because I think if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly\nThat they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think and I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and Carol van I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators in Senate meetings I think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nGuatemala actually four thousand people now grown too\nBut at a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall and that just as it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between health care education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says the show's on Romney distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nOr they may well be lying but\nIf in the end we discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia involved I suspect it will be sanctions but the difference is one thing that sanctions there's another thing you know to go wild and break up the the alliance in the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear that they regard Saudi Arabia\nAs such an important a defense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful and there's ...\nWe've got to go but I'm Mr Speaker uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi is\nThat's right and I think sometimes you use I said you know we have taken steps against Russia in concert with the British\nOver killing ... trying to poison several people but we didn't we didn't go ... I think we may have to take significant steps ear and sanctioned some people and blocks and people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly a crown prince had better clean this up or he will not be allowed back in the U.S for a long time\nI miss the bigger thank you for being with us we got to take a break by David shown and Carter Page will join us as the deep state gate gets a little deeper eh
