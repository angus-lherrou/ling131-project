practicing tyrants their history okay in absolute lie there hadn't been crimes against women where they have occurred we must condemn them\nBy men throughout history have given their lives and their

for Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think it's done a phenomenal job or as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin in ... I Hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close\nA we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican Kemp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rest musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota I Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana that can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing\nAnd I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should have been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well and then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ... important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make a difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering up a big portion and percentage of seats I ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nWhat if he's not fighting then we're not winning\nAnd when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made it was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime\nFrom ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the white blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury\nApparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great with therapy for the world and we got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I

the so called leaders of the Democratic party and that's what that's what we've got to understand here\nThis is the modern left the Democratic party there is no vision there's no there's there are no solutions being offered there's a lot of hate being pedaled around a lot of innuendo now we know the not the party of the constitution and due process and presumption of innocence\nYou know these values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly no alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence it might even live next door to you don't know where these people are\nWhen we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is

warrant\nThat so forth buys a warrant the third renewal application all of it based on the pony dusty a in every case some fraud committed upon the size of courts and then the same information that we now have learned the media league strategy that existed\nJust before at least a page that nobody had any evidence of any Trump Russia collusion at all and Peter structure that there's no there there at all but now we know what the insurance policy was they had immediately strategy to to create the impression that there was a lot that they had\nWhen in fact it was them leaking to different news sources to create the impression that this was real\nAnd then of course you know uniting what they're good friend Robert Mueller and that's why it's been a witch hunt\nFor whatever Eighteen months\nThe biggest abuse of power ever that pony dusty it used to manipulate not only by the court judges and committed brought on them\nBut that information was disseminated before the election so that the American people would buy the lies on the propaganda and and vote for Hillary oh jeez the hookers in a bad urinating in Moscow we can all like this guy\nAnd then it got used again and again and again they weaponized what turned out to be nothing but at the bumped set of documents that its own author won't stand by\nAnyway why won't Rod Rosenstein know pure under oath before the committees with Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte where's the subpoena demanding that he turned over the the three oh Tuesday buys the war it's all these things that have been requested\nJim Jordan who's joining us Freedom Caucus member candidate to be speaker of the house of representatives if the Republicans winning twenty six days\nAnd congressman Dave Brat of Virginia and by the way Congress Monday bread it happens to be in one of those districts that is a very very tough but winnable district if you're in what district you in ... in the commonwealth her\nSeventh seventh district Sean ...\nIf you're in the seventh district and the commonwealth of Virginia let me tell you something we need Dave Brat as part of the Freedom Caucus within that's the only group that's been out there fighting to keep the promises that the Republicans made\nYou know for the last seven years and he's been fighting hard every day and he's taken a lot of heat for it and now they're thrown tons of money to get him defeated\nIf you're in the seventh district in Virginia I Hope you go out and vote for Dave Brat maybe help out his campaign if you cut and we welcome both of you to the program a gym let me start with you is it is it three or four people now that say that Rod Rosenstein or on\nHow many have you been out\nThere there there are several and here's the bottom line when the when the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction\nAsk you to come in and testify in this case the chairman of the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to do that remember Rod Rosenstein it and it can from when he goes through the confirmation process you get asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress has question when called is it so that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ... ... actually a account\nOf someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he's in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it's very difficult to come in at birth order your maybe he's the guy who have been on the carpet and understand the timeline on may ninth Kobe is fire based on the Rosenstein Nemo or make six eight to ... when he had this conversation with police the page and Andy McCabe where he said he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI cheap council Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn ... feet and of course may seventeenth it's when Bob Mueller his name's Becca ... constantly on what what else happened on ...\nThat they were able to cook adopted up that director\nThe same day it's kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happened and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know that there are no we'll get signed one month later so ... the timeline and what we what it's all you want to bring in and ask questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this but first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going good weren't went on the pilot the or the health care immigration practices that my opponent is a clerk your local and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions then because they\nKnow they're going after you and never come back talk big time during your right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nI should really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running on the resistance than out and do vote and that that's why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba ... and then she'll every yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left\nI think the ah the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona meal loving Utah Colorado is the number of seats there there was it and if people want the full list of the the we've identified the top Seventy\nIt's we put it up on the Hannity dot com oh so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman who was in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days congressman tried\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase ups on his way you been doing it how radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there's the dilemma today\nIs that they apply Capra Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when America was never that great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary nearly so\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the Web has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nI'm Shaun how are you I'm good what's happening\nHey I just had Jim Jordan and that day brat on there and you've had a a a Trey Gowdy I think previously over the past time but the thing that irritates me about when you talk to these guys and this Rod Rosenstein a fiasco that's going on [noise]\nYou'd never ask them why don't they just\nSomebody stand up and make this guy up here and how does he keep his job when he won't come and you know go before Congress like he's being instructed to\nWell I mean that's a great that's a great point because you and I wouldn't be able to duck a subpoena\nWe you and I wouldn't be able to if they subpoenaed are documents good luck to us\nIt was like in the case that Hillary Clinton ... have you ever subpoenaed you know your emails and your delete thirty three thousand of 'em and then you bleach pick your hard drive and have someone bus stop your devices and take out sim cards just what's going to happen to re just take a guess\nYeah yeah I Know you're going to jail in\nJordan I liked Dave Brat I like all these guys but after a while you just find out they're they're they're all talk and no actually\nThat's not true I mean do you think of everything that we have gotten we've been able to peel the onion to the point where we've exposed to all of this happened they listen every document we have gotten is because we had to pull teeth to get everything I mean we we are getting their hope you see that\nYou've given it to him on a platter but they will act on it for\nWell it's not Jordan and it's not brat and it's not meadows but it is some of the leadership and the Republican Party that are weak and timid and learn nothing of the success of Donald

new line but it's never been the case Jonathan I mean that's why we chronicled the every two and four years and I think we saw the worst of the worst with judge Kavanaugh you know immediately I Believe\nI think people that make serious allegations like was made in the case of professor port they've got to be listened to but she gave the names of people including an eye witness that didn't corroborate their story\nYou know the the problem we're we're we're having now Sean is that we don't just have the same rhetoric that politics have every year we also have activists out there we have um\nDifferent groups like an tougher and are bombings necessary be am in ... these people are actively going out and causing fear and intimidation using violence as we saw in Portland, Oregon when you combine all these things\nThe the rhetoric the violence the on the ground in your face type of stuff is there going and intimidating the politicians and then speakers when they're out eating what you're seeing is an escalation far beyond just rhetoric which we've had before and even when you have somebody like Dr Ford given testimony it gets match\nThat gets covered up whether it's serious or real there's evidence or not this stuff gets so covered up by a motion\nUm and they've gotten completely out of control now to a point where\nUh there there is no truth I mean you look at these statements that Eric Holder made you can't double speak you can't say kick people and then say let's not do anything illegal that's double speak\nBut then you know this has been your party name one thing that does your Democratic Party ... party is offering the American people besides impeachment endless investigations keeping the failure of Obamacare wanting the crumbs back of the tax cut open borders eliminating ice what what what are they going to do for the\nMen and women in this country\nUm after eight years of failure with Rocco bomb or what are they gonna what are they offering what are they running on except hatred\nAnd different again I at ... Craig's list and conditions Medicare and Medicaid care that environment or they don't want to\nAsk what are they going to do they had eight years uh Brock Hussein Obama as president\nThirteen million more Americans on and on food stamps have more in poverty accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined the lowest labor participation rate since the Nineteen seventies and the only president in history never to reach a ... percent GDP GDP Growth than a year\nYou know they had that they had the football they they they ran backwards the country went backwards now we got eight million Americans out of poverty for a million or food stamps\nFor a million jobs manufacturing jobs over almost five hundred thousand of those those are jobs Obama set of never coming back why should anybody vote Democrat 'cause all we hear is as lies negativity et cetera et cetera\nNot George W.

they change from the Obama years what did they offering besides I hate Donald Trump\nWas like I said we had we care about any case we care that\nI we got a bad line again have been to China than what is it\nYou know suddenly you just said a second ago about how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter\nIs the fact that we're here and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that but we we have rhetoric in Washington DC\nThat is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if they are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college change the number of Supreme Court justice is ridiculous stuff like that and it's\nHow do you become a party that doesn't even believe in simple due process the constitution presumption of innocence how you know how how do you become a party that is now noted for\nYou you know people in your party confronting people and in restaurants women Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders you can't you can't even go have a bite to eat without being confronted now\nYou know the list that you've been doing over the past year about all the stuff that has to do with the Russia investigation all that if you did a list on your show of all the things that the Democratic party is trying to do to get away from the way we live

other countries with no excuses and what ... what happens when you do that people fall into Iran and they're easily\nCan we're a constitutional republic right you know it's for example surreal law as
