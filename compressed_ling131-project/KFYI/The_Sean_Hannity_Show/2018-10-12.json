Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handled Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing\nThe president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it hurt don't told Trump to bring these guys in the eyes shut and all and I should have known Geraldo\nTold Trump to get Kanye West in there and Joe Brown and tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know that her into did bring up a or something I forgot it was\nKanye West who told George W. Bush\nThat\nHe didn't think he cared about black people because Hurricane Katrina boy that remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the left was out there saying that Bush wanted blacks in Louisiana New Orleans to be hurt so that they would leave\nAnd they go to Texas or someplace to lessen\nThe strength of the Democratic party in Louisiana they were out there saying that the Bush also a was able to steer the hurricane\nAnd that Bush was responsible for the Lebanese being weak because he didn't hold people accountable when they didn't spend the money to shore them up\nIn other words if you're going to come to America and you want to be a part of our family you got to start with one basic simple fundamental rule and that is that you've got to obey our laws\nI think that's that should be basic and fundamental\nFor anybody the issue of incivility is now back in the forefront even more I mean it shouldn't surprise anybody um and by the way what is really happening what a play ... James O'Keefe is going to join us\nAnd the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there him and his campaign in his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people at tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play a few later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them off oh why do we get to the tape on sentiment today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but then when they get there and here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that sort of first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip has a hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering solutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers ferret out\nAll across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in\nJeopardy and you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama which put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty\nAnd he became the only president in history ever\nThat never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in creating factories manufacturing centers here and tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation\nPer unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America\nAnd then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America and then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years\nAnd he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody is that all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like\nWell I Do think we need some prison reform I give me an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of Alice marine Johnson remembers a woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug a fence\nA grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties like there's no one knew on some times in our criminal justice system\nAnyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\nInto the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you thank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York while I've been hearing the Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred burning Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's it's sad it's unnecessary I our our human our human family and Palin are being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making with things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know the ... they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd why as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viral thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow they'll read flat folks aren't that he just praying tiny west and the race\n... ...

in the mirror and say you did everything you could\nDo because there's a lot at stake that's not going to\nBe the end of the world of the Democrats were just going to make every thing harder and more divisive and more difficult and it's going to waste our time and slow or progress I ... that's really the truth\nAnd it's important that we keep the momentum are you better off than you or two years

lead\nAnd remember if you have that happening and that many states you're not going to get a blue wave in the house\nAt the same voters of the same people and and the tide is not there but but there's something else or you just said that I think's really important and again I'm I'm thinking out loud with you so you trigger the reporting you're doing is treated this in my own thinking I think our folks so to start shifting towards humor\nI mean I I really mean is I think you can take\nYou know I mean here I Am I'm I'm throwing is hard to punch is like yeah I'm I'm fighting as hard as I Know how to fight and then you had any just what your foot off the gas and tell a joke you\nKnow no no no I Want you to put your foot in the gas even more but remember as Reagan often proved sometimes humor is more devastating that anger\nHe's right now so for example British and I I really think marshes editorial it'll be ... it's okay\nWell I understand you're a liberal well understand you're going to vote for humor that don't don't be ashamed of it it's All right\n[laughter] foreign history you really are\nAnd and again I think I think it's just something I just I learned this in part from from theater wage great coverage oh John F.

I Can't but I think there should be over now\nBut they let us on the first thing we should say ... why would you want to be the senator from the meth capital of the world I mean if you believe the stuff he said why would you want to represent people are crazy what what's wrong with you\nCan't bring life you know and I never really I think\nI think we should we should accept they really are who they are\nI accept that and I also was another thing that the there is no more moderation you know the history of relationships even Tip O'Neill and Reagan I mean those days are long long gone and the era of moderation or a scoop Jackson Democrat or even Joe Lieberman got thrown out of the party Mr Speaker that\nPretty much says it all that was one of the nice as human beings ever\nYou cannot be a moderate Democrat today and survive a and and be because you just get more and more and more isolated I mean I thought it was very telling that the votes on Kavanaugh\nYou have people who might have had a better chance of getting re elected but they couldn't break with their caucus only want to do with their donors only\nOne person and not to give them credit Joe mansion ... probably my home is in a you know I'm sure he got that helped me out of 'em by Chuck Schumer and company\nThey were desperate for him to not vote because they didn't want it to be bipartisan\nAnd that's what his vote to\nWell I mean I guess that means he's strong and he's like you're not going to ruin my career because you because of your radical left his agenda maybe it'll even think about becoming a Republican to be wins and that is the one seat that seems safe or red state Democrats the only one you know this point\nI think that's right I think and and it really even Asian if you watch the ... even when he voted for Kavanaugh the numbers narrow the races closer today than it was a week ago because I think\nWhat's happened is people hooked up and suddenly realized what a team sport this is that you got two teams in and there's a really simple question for every so called moderate and I'd say this I Would also says to mention is he was really going to vote for humor\nSome fair question everybody needs to be asked that question that's a Democrat\n'cause we because we tend to vote for ... why would why would West Virginians send somebody to Washington to take power away from Mitch McConnell in a neighboring state\nMean McConnell least understands West Virginia [noise] humor as contempt for West Virginia as Hillary Clinton has contempt as just recently in two weeks ago you know you add\nI'm Nancy Pelosi saying things that were contemptible about what's really there's the question I'll be opposed to ... why are you even running\nI don't know if I go to vote for him or why run\nYou know when you look at things that have been said and I mean just in recent times I mean the the idea of smelly\nWalmart boaters or or we can't be civil or\nJoe Biden saying in September the Trump voters of the ... society\nOr era de mobile deplorable ... or ... bitter people\nClinging to their God guns bibles in religion I mean it's pretty obvious where these people are you you haven't had a chance you have to see the bread is in office beat the undercover video project ...

the pasture in Turkey\nToday President Trump is once again\nDelivered for American delivered for religious liberty and for human rights another victory for him and for America or the other side basically just wants to resist and then I take it to a very specific issues I think Kevin McCarthy is in the introduction\nOf a bill to control the southern border that will be voted on in December is

probably part two three four and five coming and what are you got\n[noise] well there there's a this is the ... the biggest congressional elections of our lifetime and\nAnd in in the past we've done parts of a particular state and this time we've got multiple states\nI'm four years ago we did for these and we've got so many and this is a problem Sean that in all the swing states we have another one coming out early next week it's a similar problem and use red state Democrats having to lie to their voters to get elected it it it is and every single\n... do you want to give us a hint what state is is there is one of is it either North Dakota Indiana and Missouri is Arizona Florida one\nOf those it's one of the ones you just mentioned and and and be happening we have an editor on tape and and listening to Shaun\nOh they have their senator on tape that means it's not Arizona let me go but his [laughter] so it could be in and that could be Heidi Heitkamp Joe Donnelly could be\nOn western Montana and yes Claire McCaskill is\nOn tape it centers on eight and let me tell you that in our democracy people need to be informed they have to know what people actually believe in how they're gonna vote I don't\nAnd that's before the release of the tape that we showed last night of cinema and twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona that she wants to vote for her crazy I don't think that's going to go over well nor do I think it's going to go over well that she invited this\nThis radical attorney to Arizona State university at a university a lawyer convicted of aiding and abetting an Islamic terror organization and its leader\nAnd the lawyer in question represented someone who was one sentence to life in prison\nOr set a sentence for in the nineties for blowing up a

served our country with incredible distinction\nUm and here to go through all these latest numbers and what it means and whether or not or this is gonna be the blue wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over redux\nA we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shown is with us welcome both the back to the program\nThank you thank you thank you I don't think there's any doubt the Kavanaugh overreach\nAnd the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence has now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and send them out in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies\nAnd when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I ... I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing and how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm\nMcCaskill is losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want jobs\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is do you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your closer to raise taxes take what you've got take away the jobs to take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans don't want to go back to that I mean we have holes in September with with Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country so these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play or Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction\nThat Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it yeah I Do\nI think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of New York\nAnd I've noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat their problem is not me they stem cells are streaming\nMade it to me that there are actually are conservatives certainly notice that it's not a\nSimple number one Hans within a size life oh no\nA I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nWhenever office would like to run for I think my friend John and I can ... the ... well you\nDisabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I say look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still in hand with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers\nI've never looked at it as I Know for a good idea what the hell my God I Know you're not exactly run up to the Supreme Court but there
