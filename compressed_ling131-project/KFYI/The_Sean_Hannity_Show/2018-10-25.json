number which is one eight eight eight New York city save and that's for anything new or if someone as information about any of the instruments this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make George our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature or any other kind of nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nTry joint terrorist taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision that can say with certainty that we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York

is why we fight\nOr defeating America's enemies with no apologies thank you both for being here you know Bernie ... ... you know I listen to Hillary yesterday\nCompared to what you said a week ago I listen to you know Andrew Cuomo worst governor of New York history say conservatives he they're not New Yorkers they don't belong here I had every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I could do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now yes they say no e pluribus owned them and I'm like you're so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them try to put the blame on the president then making these choices are as you know Sean was much I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck\nBranded in the middle of our broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought it was a good idea\nThe general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be a and then he got on for it had been a blast of the president's I just think it's bizarre I took his way over the top I think\nWhat happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left and they send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then then you have to ruptured and said that ... was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this had been a tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chase me down the block trying to get me to come back we're calling me\nBut you know what a doctor said enough already listen this is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh this is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and granted we're at the max dividing uh ... the audience that was watching the show\nIs no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka ... nobody ever\nNot being conservatives that have been you know same things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House\nUm it's been Hollywood wants to punch the president in the face and showing separate heads of the president and those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives in\nYou know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here it's I've been saying for weeks now\nGoing back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress\nSomebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get killed and no one will hold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up and then those people that were silent when it's a Republican now or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric and this is this is horrible he can't fake news they are fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment what'd you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the list of who it is CNN anybody tell me which Republican which member of either the media\nOr the political leadership made political profit\nFrom Bernie saw this woman to shooting Steve Steve ... which Republican member of the the pop the all
