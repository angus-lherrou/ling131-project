moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I listen to what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nMy oven on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days\nAnd on almost I you can see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the holes you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this was a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting in eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant\nThere run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off taught some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they loved the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein was speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news\nAnd they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news\nAnd they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should've seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies oh the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted\nDo this for cheap political points my answer is I Want everybody safe everybody needs to stop and

like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this was going to be better it out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing a van at the White House\nAnd he was with the vice president he retweeted the vice president's comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as\nMedia outlets left wing politicians you know around the country we've got to protect our politicians they getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nKnow that is this happened to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened to Don junior and his family we know that it has happened just\nRice and letters were sent to Trump in Madison ray and has just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt though Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMaybe even watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD they have their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all we don't know if they were alive we'll get updates from sure throughout the day\nNow the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act I strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority\nSaid the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable

C. N. D. C. I remember getting a call from Tom Brokaw she's producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real\nUm you don't know who sent them look purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices said and they got that without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie [noise] [noise] well ... when you get NATO to stuff or you know you blow to pieces gets harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send who uh who runs ... a machine right so now you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps were writing the device little side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah but you know watched on tons of different times of different technologies get sprint know mailing list of those different areas and there are so many packages loses a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like ... okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's a lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is that devices are no don't when with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nAnd sent the vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period hole stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically a strategically devious he would send those bombs\nAnd it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop\nA new kind of a ... the same ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this\nThey're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices any clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that\nThis person or persons I'm wanting to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish Sean I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent the CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet\nAnd you can figure out the John Brennan and you know it'd be the comet he's not a CNN\nCountry this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were a enough of the Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility you think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that's I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you add a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City\nWhen he got ... ridge just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms of the next two weeks\nSo we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days um they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here um that's been captured\nWouldn't you first be looking for some radical fringe\nWe often after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and I've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could it be and were Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered that a lot of these people engaged in this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see based I going to have an obviously haven't analyze these devices but having seen what the press is put out and what's in the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices as the foremost someone either\nDidn't know what they were doing in March sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God war\nThey somehow wanted to get caught like we saw on that bombing in in in Austin but you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish that they that they almost weren't even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre uh this whole case is very bizarre even look John

McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states the elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the school have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and\nWe and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your mom poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here\nAnd and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff the same\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to work with the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be selling liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know because Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well it got\nIts protests are it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that well that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to work with the moderates and they and they can only make one choice once\nBut he did not have a choice\nIt's lying is is a a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that Phil Bredesen hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't it doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNo I Know and it it it's in a hurry to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated as like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in\nMissouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something I'm Sean if it's wrong\nFor me to go Under Cover and ...\nThese folks and how wrong is
