in Saudi Arabia he's not an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years Saudi council and it can be heard on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I'm king corroborate doesn't only telling you what the New York post and and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet\nAnyway return to Riyadh on Tuesday ahead of a plan search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took the show gave to some parents that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show he but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nSource told the site that his dad took seven minutes forensic physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air go on and the Turkish foreign minister and three rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMy palm pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts adapt to the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nStop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to have close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nYou have a pro government newspaper reporting that could show geese apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out in body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's\nGoing on and we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan Hoffman Fox News contributors thirty year CIA up operations officer\nA duck the Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned uh I think this man is that\nWhether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often out of the wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was cork in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist was Americans that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common faith that you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history\nOf ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century ... so all of these things a total statement for factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hot but it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murders and the most evil root for brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered\nAnd we know he just show again never exited the consulate um we do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly did\nBring a ... body after he was killed or what we don't know\nWhat were the orders that were given the fifteenth outing and who gave them the orders and then to do that they report postpartum those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think with a hundred percent right to dispatch secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they ... issue of grave concerns what we'll get back with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when they gave it apart with poison back in March\nBritish home secretary ... that\nWe needed a void speculation while we allow the police carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would highlight is that well if I'm paying with needing and doing its public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an ... an uncle or up probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe\nThat the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had Gemini and the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat or not the ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics itself domestically it is the author of the ... the uh over the perfect I'm On the truth is wrong we have a lot of um average or with Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood ties through a and B as the mom had been found them in the ... relationships are not going to be tested but\nThis is a nation\nThat revival depends upon our support militarily and I'm surrounded and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is talk of eight\nI Wish we were to leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we don't knowing the gays and lesbians or killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like fourth class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShort guy can I give you one example of how bad it was so this guy who was a

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discussed\nAnd I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator\nHad been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five\nImpeach forty five then we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna\nDo don't tell them what you have is a massive fraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary scenario for the country\nAnd for people that ... that's the only way they can win is ally ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees that McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate through the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected and instead of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um\nI think we the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also had said the minute Kavanaugh was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these anarchists middle class of benders attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her\nCampaign side I mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but\nI think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill's statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she had been quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of fraudulent embedding someone in my campaign first of all I\nCategorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV [noise] Shaun Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will walk by what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own their own their own or it's not\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next to roast about how she's going to impeach Trump that you can tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and innuendo an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you know what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know my M. O. a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release a candidate a bit of the time we have to United States senators\nAnd their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the ... tactics against the landscape stealing ski was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction we have two reactions now and\nWe're going to the next state will be releasing another video early next week and a very very a battleground state same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected to the new deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotape stopped my words stopped my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nNot to let people watch it to themselves and they can decide people are pretty smart um oh James O'Keefe is with us founder and the c._e._o. project very toss dot com and\nThe videos are up there and you can check 'em out yourself a boat Claire McCaskill and her staff and bill Brett a son and his staff and now he's telling us there's more to come we'll come back we'll take a quick break we'll come back and continue eight hundred nine four one Sean or toll free telephone number will make a quick stop or there is an opponent for\nPocahontas Elizabeth Warren Jeffs deal and or does that that that raised now need re evaluation by the people of Massachusetts will get to that\nAnd your calls a eight hundred million for one shown as a number will continue\n[noise]\nPartying and investigating\nReports about suspicious financial transactions to a reporter\nThe report contained information about former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort Trump's campaign official Richard ...
