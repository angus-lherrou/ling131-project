a plan for impeachment of President Trump is revealing here\n\nHold on a huge man I get the moderates\nWhat are we found a moderate and after ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] and all of you know\nOver\nWe discovered that McCaskill is receiving money from democratic US Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nLet me get money from ... to our link I pack okay another one of those things where we get the money and mine you know keep it on a deal yeah I don't understand how to fly on during the war crime\nI just take the money [laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they ask in less they specifically ask ... voting for the wall we shouldn't let them go they need to think that so I think she's going to say thanks for the wall and they don't ask me and let them think that\nAnd if they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment shut up about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course she would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly she says she supports say hey gun control group\nYou know in our staff is saying well wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAn Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses Scott this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line oh he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power and it's being exposed to very high level I mean this is really\nYou know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people of Tennessee uh Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing the senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars that's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we release the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate rather than you know responded by fumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office thrown thing is actually the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of those powerful pieces which when the sky Glenn Winfrey one of McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we're going to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is the other guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views no I confronted neck on the street yesterday with a microphone ethnic why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee it's true in North Dakota\nOh how are these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposed\nYou don't want you know what I disagree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty and embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I keep hearing to everybody on they're showing on TV\nIf you look the houses in play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a boat for Claire McCaskill or British ... or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nYou know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to this\nThings but that's a shrinking group of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there's honest because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so it's very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week\nBritish and talk to local media this is the kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well in all these ... these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is that the Democratic spokesperson for the British in campaign he actually apologized to the media can you believe that Sean apologize\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's in response now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video\nHow bad as a band and what is the alternative\nIn terms of a solution will get to all of that lives in all of us here on the Sean Hannity show we love the

C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about\nAtlas MD Dr Josh ... and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child they negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nAnd a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store it's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nSo that people can tune in and literally see we've also put up an interactive map on Hannity dot com that people can use\nAnd you also see it Christian cinema is imploding out in Arizona\nProject Vera tossed with the tape that they released the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on the same happened to governor governor Bredesen and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nUh we now see Heller was very important state of Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll at least eight I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response to hurricane I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott\nHas really shown if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election right here in Jersey that's for Hurricane Sandy hit and the President Obama had the advantage of acting like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney is basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama because Mitt Romney at all the\nMomentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nFor a strobe I'm at that time and he said yesterday is why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with her DNA\nNow he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nA fence around that she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that ... that one one thousand twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is it but her she literally personally change herself to\nStatus when U. Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority\nFemale professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry it and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren really reveals proof\nOf Native American ancestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front\nRunner but the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah I Know you turn to see who the Democrats settle on ... and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a group formed by none other than John Podesta\nThey're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project beret ... tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times or obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and strategies to prepare the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern and and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reporter by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missile over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with Kavanaugh as well even that CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America\nGreat again or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a if it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like it did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her uh if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safer at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state tendency red standing\nBeside the way that he has a rep I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nNow there you go yeah and and remember ... federal Rourke out more money than any count my gosh are eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think they'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration 'cause they Republicans in Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory\nOf ... unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably gonna pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty midterms\nI have gone against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten so I was thinking you know I ... I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that the Republicans keep the house and if that happens\nAfter all this negative press that President Trump has received the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think back then you have two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality\nAnd we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings and you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say in it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nNot allowed to say the words mob rights they will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter on the hill a will come back we're also\nBut as we continue Joe ... is with the hills all the\nCoverage stormy stormy stormy kind of was a big deal that California judge throughout her case and demanded that she paid legal fees for Donald Trump but for the president tweeting about or today I don't think anyone would is willing to cover it at all\nYou know I I don't try to figure out who's having a worst month um the New York giants\nElizabeth Warren or Michael ... I'm Sorry I have an audio complete those those two names uh yeah I mean that's that's pretty big that that was thrown out Sean because [laughter] I mean that's the killer that now stormy is actually responsible for Trump's legal fees I ... and by the way it should\nBe always gotten ... from the beginning I'm kind of it these are street fighter um but I think what especially during the cabinet hearings with Julie sweating egg I mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis\nYou know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls and these boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of adults almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on his ... I think a fairly smart guy right and and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that with this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly he went back\nTo parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back and oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can collaborate the story at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the for people that Julie sweating except for those parties one's dead or to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't know who actually sweating it watch so now Democrats who used to hell of an ... and the media obviously\nAnother story but also hurting on it but in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process in the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe ... over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only meeting he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much great break right back your calls on the other side of big candidates and I tell you about that in a minute including pastor Brunson\nIs going to speak out his first cable interview tonight at nine what it was like in prison in Turkey and much more [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThe hurricane Michael gets to go off from the ...

the radio I mean I Can't just we don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain who you really are especially that's why they call radio a warmth medium\nFat you're exactly right you're exactly right look shot in the reason I caught was that was on your program yet they fight a clip from Larry Clinton's speech and in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility\nIn this country used to elect Democrats and then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion\nChief telling us telling the American people\n[noise] the only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up is still a Democrat\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand\nSince the day Donald Trump won the left\nIn this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob in some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera\nAll of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them you know wanted anywhere anymore\nOkay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen\nAnd the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos\nOf ... it is either they're not telling Maxine Waters that said they keep telling me not to say it then you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because then you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it's sad that Hillary Clinton that the cheap Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian ...\nTo ... and then had all of our deep stay friends lying to the American people with unverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives this is who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said how we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation\nOpening up bad ... building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs so you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're going to watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when maybe they lose the house you lose the house\nThen all you're going to see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeachment that's the agenda that's it\nThere's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... and so there's a lot of states\n[noise] the Democrats rely on people of low information they rely on propaganda in putting things out there and
