million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our

scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit landed a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job is starting the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told is the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage it there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane and the golf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast and I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category where he perhaps even\nA a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing what does it mean to look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern when Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely I said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there\nIt did last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComic to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap on ... or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto we\nHit it off to the east over there with or this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's hitting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nIn a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is gonna be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't have to ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nBeing down it's all good for the American people I don't know why people you know there are different people different styles and life like lenders very combative and drops the F bomb a lot on this was not

getting information needed information from the project and all kinds of important conversation between struck page he rejected and promise we had to go with the Justice Department finding this wouldn't be the first time he has given us information frankly I think we're entitled to I Want a real well we've got thirty seconds I don't have time to get into another subject carrier Mr\nUm which I appreciate that but I Do think it's interesting that you had\nYou discovered it and we couldn't get it right away like all the other ... ... we had to wait until the final report\nRight our to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the D. O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fight that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah quarter won by John Solomon\nOh Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember\n... cave and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this any way now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain and the FBI lawyer that\nWas assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that the source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI remember then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein would have said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nBut making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates an already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon\nRemember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease ... an investigative reporter is what the hell\nReg Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nYou all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we've got a first start with the ... the timeline is may twenty Seventeen well that's\nAnd Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... at least a page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all it was was the ... recycled the different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that rarely I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director that allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... to market may they still had or wherever you're from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump are biased read that investigation he get fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that the roses is a a McKay and a stroke page\nIt's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather be can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with ... but I'm sure that could talk about history his book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a softer right\nLook at this we have the FBI they're not investigating a crime here that in\nFact they can't find a crime by a page\nAs well at least the pages testimony just to be clear she said they they had found nothing in nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI the deputy attorney general\nOr allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road with the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a great Jerry why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using in misusing\nTheir power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious but the people in the conversation with Rosenstein who are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was dead\nSerious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing\nClaims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devon newness\nAnd said oh I was misunderstood and now in his attempted coup of the president or the evidence indicates he is saying oh I was misunderstood it was my words were misinterpreted it was just sarcasm\nGuy by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenties sixteenth election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton at the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance how the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer Warren wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jarrett continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong Greg Jarrett\nYou got out a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection\nAnd conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed they doubled down and they continue to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller\nViolated other federal regulations that say you may never use\nVerified information to\nGain a fight so wiretap warrant on an American citizen and they never had it verified Rosenstein signed off on the final renewal application and he had no new evidence no\nIt ... back to the does the I I Will take a quick break we'll come back more Greg Jared Sean Solomon and your calls later in the

daughter evolve good to be a replacement for Haley\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I get in a bad accident right\nRight and you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really a good ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline then as simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call you do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... and see you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you've you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nGet we've helped over five hundred and fifty\nThe doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise] um and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of duck ah docks where a patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation has er physician run house policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in back to the table to have conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create a ... tour you know ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it for all\nAnd you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because of the ... shots water we ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see the the you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close enough I was about ... upon us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shocked that gather news and who is now offering free health care\nFor everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's going to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick um\nBut there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that are up public in his within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas MD and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month show\nAnd the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they are paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it the what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nOr so at the ... just brought a door explorer that access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... do you deny them service\n... everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWhat they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take New York out of the equation for California ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I Can't and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than\nWhat about Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move towards your system\n[noise] uh I I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nMake a quick break we'll come back more with Dr Josh amber outlets MD and Dr Lee as grows president ah
