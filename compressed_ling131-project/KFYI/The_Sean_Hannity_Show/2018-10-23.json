White House communications director for Trump for about eight teen days\nAny remains got a new book out um and it's it's I forgot the title of it but he's making his rounds wasn't Hannity last night and Hannity said why did the Democrats even have a shot in Fifteen days and it's a question a lot of people who are in the world would vote for Democrats why would you vote for anybody\nThat is promising to wipe out all the progress why would you vote for any party that wants to literally shut down the progress and here's what the more ... had to say\nIt's because of the media probably Sean I mean I think that could be one of the main reasons most people predicted that the house and so forth goes to the other side but the president is demonstrating that he can get the voter turnout\nEven in a midterm election and so I think it can be very close I mean you're not going to be surprised if our friends are not going to be surprised Rush Limbaugh is not going to be surprised if the Democrats um don't win or don't ...\nYeah it gets you know again conflicting news if you missed the beginning of the program there there's I'm Charlie Cook\nWho is the inside the beltway go through and analyze in predicting the outcome of a off year election wrote in election and then you have\nThe um [noise] what was it oh yeah Nate Silver eighty five percent chance of Democrats when the house and cook has identified ... more seats tending Democrats I don't I don't know how many are left to go Democrat the last I looked these guys had two hundred nine seats leaning Democrat\nI mean [noise] practically over and yet NBC has a poll out showing that early voting and enthusiasm\nThe Republicans are dwarfing Democrats in early vote it never happens\nJoe Biden and Obama can't draw flies today rallies they're having for democratic candidates and Trump can't get a venue big enough to let everybody in so it's confusing I myself again state I Will not be surprised if this blue wave doesn't materialize to be anything\nSimply really tell me\nAnd that's what I handed off for the lead guy\n[noise] so so when you\nIt goes right now it hits me from the start of\nThe matter is you can just make stuff up that's why you're learning from the United states it gets cold and dark out\nGet called the no account well we\nKnow is record eight years Thirteen\nMillion more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty lowest labor participation rates in the seventies worst recovery since the forties lowest homeownership rate in fifty one years the only president in American history

you better off than you were two years ago well the fourteen states that now have record low unemployment I think I Would say this I decisively yes\nOr ... or record low record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets and youth unemployment all setting record low numbers\nThat's great for the American people\nWe have better trade deals than we've ever had were paying less abroad than we've paid before because the president's negotiating even with NATO even with Western European countries we have a much better deal the benefits are farmers for one or dairy guys for too\nI'm In Wisconsin and Michigan and elsewhere\nThe the manufacturing jobs that Obama said would never coming back now starting to come back four hundred

didn't pay a penny to get back to the remains of Americans that have been there since Nineteen fifty three or four or whatever it is\nAnd it still gets criticized and all of this under the cloud of a phony you know conspiracy theory that is now the bunk to basically at this point Trump Russia collusion\nWell that's coming to an end to end and fourteen days you'll decide if Nancy Pelosi gets the gamble back you'll decide if\nIt Maxine Waters is the head of her committee and Adam Schiff the liars ahead of his committee and Gerald ... is the head of his committee and nonstop investigation

give me your best shot at the bottom line is if they really cared about the issue was they said they did\nWell then Cory Booker would be under investigation because those allegations made about an assault this weekend about am\nNever mind what he had already admitted he did on his own\nOn top of Keith Ellison he would have been investigated not one of the these Democrats have called for an investigation I don't know if any of its true the person that seems the most credible here is this woman monitor hand who recently dated Keith Ellison it was his girlfriend she's got tapes and and

this year\nIs just an astonishing achievement and I think it does very well ah for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what three weeks three and a half weeks but\nOne thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I don't ... and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nShow show now you'll understand\nPsychologically what Abraham Lincoln went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight as soon as this this was you know you aren't going to choose and he said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I Will have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because he he when he talked about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning to manage money if if the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices then you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them and northern Mexico and if you ask yourself this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be that Mexico this decide whether they want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they return\nThe border but under no circumstances should we accept them and they shouldn't have college done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend this decision as to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons and they're blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know but\nThe reality is by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do it we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have it would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nBut remember in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best plan for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact creator and effective human

now\nI Would add to that caravan Kavanaugh\nThe mobs we now you saw it happen to Kevin McCarthy is how's it through a Boulder through the window I'm at so they did the Henry Kissinger you saw what they did the Mitch McConnell is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing league claiming credit for it yesterday\nIf they want the success to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choice election but I I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] well I think that's right um\nAnd I think that that is a sense\nOf the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left that you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to a total of cherry and attitudes or that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force to a former attorney general saying when the Republicans go low kick them or you have various democratic leaders saying it's OK to harass people ah and drive them out of public life or you can remember that Maxine Waters is not a trivial person she would share\nFor the banking and financial services committee if they get control of the house show a significant people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage in a sense of\nThe legitimacy of of the modern American government which the left passionately believes\nA nice and I think that you're right that that's a factor the reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment\nIs these historic events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics here was historic we're we're going to get\nA solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be smeared and parents who were assassinated and lied and manipulated and brown beaten into backing down so that was that was a historic moment so we'll have an effect clinics forty or fifty years\nA similarly this caravan whether it's seven thousand people or the Mexican newspapers rightness or do you have to fourteen thousand\nIf this caravan can get into the United states how big is the next caravan and the shower then after that I mean it's not like it's a one time event here the entire world is watching to see whether or not we have the guts to protect the United states of America from an invasion\nOr and if we don't trust me this will be a lot of people willing to come\nWell I think I Know exactly where they're going to head to straight to California the sanctuary stayed and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as is offering to provide for them that's where I go\nWell and remember because we we

activities which you cannot possibly imposed and at some point we're going to have a big collusion with ... century stage ... or a fundamental violation of the constitution\nWell I think that this is I I Do agree with you um\nI have a pretty good feeling about the Senate I think that\nThe way events in our in the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift for certainly in the cabinet in case you know it's amazing to watch how the you know the the other news channels are covering the president's speech last night\nOr the ... they're actually fake news CNN actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never recovered a single thing of her saying\nYou know create a crowd followed them in a grocery store and follow them in the department stores gas stations and you tell them then I Want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened a Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen of Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and you know obviously\nThis is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one\nIssue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nA you know sympathizing with their poor the poor people that are coming from other countries that have horrific a\nOppression and those other countries and bad very bad situations but we have the exact same stories for people who are on the list doing it legally with the exact same problems that I don't think we should you know highlight those people's stories\nAnd you know get more exposure to those stories that are doing it the right way and say hey listen we draw the line everyone's got the same tragedies and [noise] or we will probably we will um disrespect the people that are doing it the right way by just letting anyone come in\nYou know there isn't a you cannot allow them to do this they're not going to be allowed to create a mob at the border and rush the border and what a violent and let me tell you something if we had the wall up it would be\nMore safe and more secure for both sides let me tell you what I don't ever want to have happened and I have no doubt that many of the people not care of and they want a better life they're good people\nTheir government sucks there's no hope no opportunity and the government that gets so much aid for from us a lot of these governments that we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt\nAnd it doesn't ever get to the people where we wanted to get to\nBut the reality is is we cannot allow we are a sovereign nation we have our country that is built on a constitution and the rule of law this was the law the land we have a process designed to taking people from other countries you got to first follow the law if you want to be in America that's it\nAnd and I know the Democrats are silent on the issue but most Americans agree that you know they would be precipitating a showdown crisis where people are gonna get hurt I don't want anybody on either side to get hurt\nNobody wants innocent people hurt out we don't know we can't vouch for every person in that crowd\nWe can't say that there are not people that are bad intentions that they want to bring into America maybe it's just the tiniest the percentage what if it's five people out of fourteen thousand we cannot risk that\nAnd by the way if we allow them to Russia border bone rushed the border and get in and we were all reward that behavior will the next one's going to be fifty thousand that was going to be a hundred thousand and then we'll have what Democrats love open borders and then they'll call for amnesty when they think they have enough future generations above ...\nWe can't have it and it's going to be stopped at some point I urge Mexico to do the job now in turn these people around

me and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution as first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen poll in the early church\nAnd David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us ... and ah and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense to you know are often times phases contagious yeah and the face of one can rub off one another phase breathed into\nYour ways to you guys get in my grilled

running on the New York times best seller list welcome to you too David said a pastor Scott and Kareem\nThank you hey how're you guys thanks for having me on what day let's start with this mob everywhere we see we're not going to kick our ... I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in\nAnd I said senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out at the ballot box I have\nHave a fear and when I say fear within um regarding myself [noise] but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response would go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I had to wait situations and has a man of the ... that's why I say I'm a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the only would come out and then I found it home with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go by but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to top crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice\nWe ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed look at you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process it they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this because out of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixteen was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button I and there are a lot of ... and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing it's not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him as a message has made in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really up for\nWhat we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on how's it going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing is not predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and
