{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Yes the passenger did fall apart a call by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights\nSo if it seems to be some type of policy\nOkay that could have been figured out she called in advance so they said the flight was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland they told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had\nTo call the police forcibly remove her from the flight right and that in of itself is a huge pain there is a fun facts I think you can share this Miranda a frontier airlines features a variety animals on the tails of its point\nYeah so they're saying that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar Semitic or of\nCourse they did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering them because we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on an emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses third is again miniature horses seem to be quite a popular one and the question becomes how do people get emotional support animals\nI feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better it was actually a political that you need to go through to have an emotional support and well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the her service dog because your blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed you have to actually go to a mental health professional right and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental\nIllness or ... motion on disability you may had and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they'd be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support him cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats mini pigs ferrets the list goes on and on\nSo and they can be any age can be happy it could be a kitten it doesn't have to be a full grown\n... so this world could very well have qualified to be an emotional support animal I think she had it in some type of carrier and like it wasn't going to run around and cause a bunch of trouble\nBut listen at delta spokesperson said that they've had issues with these emotional support animals on fights including dog's having panic attacks needing to get oxygen administered to them the flight attendants being bitten by other support animals ducks just wandering the aisles blocking the beverage cards\nI Wonder if she did have a letter saying that it was an emotional support animal I Know a lot of people for those things because they're pretty easy it's yes basically a doctor is now is what it\nWas even Web sites where you can go on line fill out a yes or no questionnaire and print out your certificate sort of like becoming ordained to do your friend's wedding\nThat's just a ... it's a tough thing because\nRiding in a plane is a common space you're in tight quarters you got to share that space and be respectful of other people\nAnd you never know what's gonna happen with an animal poop and pee all over the place I'm like I said I think the squirrel was probably not going to be that big of a problem but you know once the flight attendants are asking you to get off the plane is already going to be a problem\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOh man I just love that you know I'm not typically a nervous flier at all I Do get a little wary when you know the turbulence starts hitting but other than that I'm pretty solid when it comes to fly how 'bout you Miranda\nDepends on the people that I see at the gate if they're all just kind of chilling and looking

OJ face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he was talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss then acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain and the FBI lawyer that\nWas assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as just in that timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nBut making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon he is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... Lisa Page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all it was was the dot CA recycled in different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so it would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from refrigerators pastor murdered may they still have anywhere from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's led to agents who have an anti Trump a bias read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that roses to have a a Cape and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove that accomplish ... record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with ... with the ... I'm ... ... talk about history his book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas only ... well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they and they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ... it it says that drama the FBI the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEnvision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president the United states is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing\nTheir power and the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker who was told this was serious but the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nWho are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was dead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein\nOn your home security system it's simply save Hannity dot com\nIf you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can consider cardio mobile the FDA\nCleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone and it fits in your pocket you can take any Katie anytime anywhere to order the cardio dot com K.

we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hope she'd say something that they could use an end and both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James

is\nWhen he was pretty stunning revelation and since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have said in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they

that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated all all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then

saying here that is wrong Greg Jarrett\nYou got out a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers that totally fabricated phony document based on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to

attention 'cause he's on the script guy but his name's bill priest that\nHe was ... strokes boss he was the chief of counter intelligence that the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting to try using that information for Christopher Steele ... they had just gotten betting if there hadn't been and yet the standard for the five is it must be

home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last\nYou know really a good ten years of insurance premiums that have doubled or tripled when we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is\nMeans doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's\nHow you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician run health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... with able to have conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create a ... tour you know and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're just using it for all\nAnd you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because of the ... shots wondering insuring it's using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical ... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this exact topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care\nFor everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick um\nBut there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas MD and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack a accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send him an originality\nThis throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it so you what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending and if I could\nAdd add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so something mental stretching just brought a ... that access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some

companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\n... a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings

could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you

conservative when your\nParents have lived through that it's in your blood and as a result I don't care what they say about me because as we said in the White House when they when the worst attacks were coming we ... we had um alter you only take flack when you're over the target\nKnow well what over the target a lot of us all ton of slack um I just been an honor of mine over the last you know a couple of years to get to know you and become you're finding the book is\nI'm ... you you watch the tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy used in showing that Republicans have more enthusiasm the Democrats and the lead up to the mid term elections I think the Kavanaugh hearings has awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back to work in the back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to flee the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democrat Party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent uh election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim you\nReally can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation a ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain that momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this isn't the jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nEnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it's a host\nAnd a and a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ... up this rage not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what are you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the cabinet\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA V. investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than ... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth\nNo police report and I helped expose crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions natural course of the gods now movie is amazing Cormac God's know is perhaps the most holistic through to look at Americans to bring friends and family you do not want to pass something unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion ...\nRated PG Thirteen no pledge\nRosy does it thought of dealing with ... give you the ... roaches ad scorpion spiders internally\nPi times the most iconic brand into booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now high time in ... show ... disappearance so\nPeople get as high as levels and I didn't want to call it and we had enough information now I Want to go so probably over the next twenty four hours president\nTrump speaking the pool reporters outside the White House Saturday before heading out for a Kentucky Campaign rally a Florida child used to hide drugs\nHis dad Fox is Don Graham investigators in West Palm Beach said Frederick James stashed heroin and other substances inside the short of his five year old child this is policed in search of his apartment and clean the father was carrying the young boy close to his chest heroin\n... marijuana all found and James Holmes James facing charges of child endangerment this is Fox News [noise]\n\nMy sister are who see the way to do most plumbers work on commission that means the more you spend more than ... plumbers\nYour dot com dome is your chance to be part of history and uh making busy at high time investor dot com that high time investor dot com\nHigh times holding corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found within qualify by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and chairs and kind of stuff\nYou\nAre listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show\nThem out on the show and the answer is no one else does America deserves the truth about Congress\nRule of law is indispensable to a thriving and vibrant society [noise]\nShe'll citizens from government over reaching an arbitrary ...\nPursuing truth means always yelling the fact [noise]\nEven if they run counter to our house\nIn a courtroom truth about credible evidence\nStrong opinions\nThere's a lot of talk about ... ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize what five ... five ... actually a warrant just like a search warrant in order to get five or\nA search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out that in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know assigned ...
