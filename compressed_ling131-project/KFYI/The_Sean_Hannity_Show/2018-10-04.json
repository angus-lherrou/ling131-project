{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Uh we know Claire McCaskill is a no we a have a battle going out Martha ... I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy I suppose that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap does as closed almost two dead even halt and you see Republicans and important Senate races down a dead heat in all of the states that are red states where where Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they ... they did everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that in the process\nHe may well have crippled his party or a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats\nAnd he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture when we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict is with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know it's rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever a defensive nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor before there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything parenthetically that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a witness to the assault and the eye witness said that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what it is just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such studying history\nBerkeley ignorance that has a history teacher I founded painful um he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you a pin the whole process of the rule of law collapses over in totally and it's sad to watch something like that\nYou know I think could have been a positive constructive Porsche and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created four million fewer people on on food stamps or you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the noon after the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling in war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhat he has put your finger on the key question of the selection I've as you know\nI've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and one on one of the lessons I learned was I don't care about the polls\nShow me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas\nRight down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back in the special in one um and is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up at boat\nAnd if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would rush\nTo oil behind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before you became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and\nAnd you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that them and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again and it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek ... happy\nLiberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes will go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody carries with countries richer make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that\nBecause of the intensity of anger about the way the liberals smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our ah or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me put a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning want one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including couple recounts and I had very big raised my experiences and I say this every candidate\nDo not quit 'til the polls closed and do not relax until the recount is over\nTo me it becomes a tipping point in the country where you're just going to get more of this and anybody that the Democrats don't like is is going to be subject to guilt by accusation and this type of smearing and slandering goes on I'd also like to see a change in the standard in the law if you're a public figure well do you have to show in the absence\nOf malice how do you prove an absence of malice\nIt's a ridiculous standard that nobody could ever reach which is why people like you and me whatever what people say about us we get stopped taking it\nSure look look look let me just say\nI think that overwhelmingly the American people do not want to reward that kind of behavior you know they look kind of surveys we're seeing now are amazing people have moved very significantly\nIn the last week and it's in reaction to out just to pick up all\nAre and how vicious and how personal or the Democrats have been and they brought this on themselves and I think that they're now going to repeal whirlwind\nRight Mr Speaker thanks for being Lewis

B. I. investigations remember last week well we'll just have a limited in scope and will do it in a week and we'll trust the FBI now they didn't get back what they wanted\nThe problem they their problem is much bigger they're never gonna get to the answer that they're so hoping for in the three cases that they've been using to me or slander and bludgeon judge Kavanaugh and his family\nYou know what professor board she has mentioned for people none of them remember the party and the I witnessed sheep place in the room at the time of the alleged attack said they did not ever happen ever\nIn the case of Mrs Ramirez the New York times even said they called dozens and dozens of people and they weren't able to get one corroborating witness not one\nAnd the New York times hates Donald Trump would've loved to come out with the smoking gun article that destroyed judge Kavanaugh and they even pointed out something that should concern everybody\nThat ms Ramirez was calling her former yelled classmate saying well I don't remember I'm not sure do you think it might be judge Kavanaugh that and of course then gaps in her memory and being ... and early\nAnd I don't even want to get into the whole issue of Julie sweating it can you know she goes on NBC News why this ever got reported that is beyond any understanding that I have changed our story backtracking from a story in a multitude of ways\nMentioning that there are four eyewitnesses in her case one's dead and the number two person has no idea who she is no idea at all\nAnd the allegation that on almost on a weekend basis that young boys were drugging\nYoung women and lining up in the halls and then raping gang raping these young women and then at about than to well I'm well Brett Kavanaugh I saw it near the punch bowl solidly be probably was one of them and he\nGave out red solo cups I saw him give out red solo cups wasn't lined up in the hall but he was in the hall I saw him in a home\nAnd nobody else can corroborated\nThey wouldn't never getting the answer that they want it\nBecause they've all known as the smear so now they're just me or the FBI investigators in this case that did what they were supposed to do there never was going to be a recommendation or a conclusion made by the FBI we learned that from Joe Biden in Nineteen Ninety One\nBut that wasn't the purpose of any of this their

minutes he dropped his parents and said that really that's not a problem for Deborah cats are defending our Frank\nIn any way we'll see in the political fallout of all of this now is Kavanaugh's now the president's approval rating has an all time high at fifty percent today and the president laying out the facts in this particular case we've got an election and thirty three days\nAnd every poll is now showing that the Senate races and the enthusiasm gap is tightening dramatically and significantly which is the right thing why because\nI think the American people are learning a lot that this is the Democratic party playbook\nIs a party that doesn't believe in due process or a presumption of innocence there's a party that regularly smears Flanders\nUses character assassination character blood thinning all in the process to gain their own power is not one agenda item that you can cite any Democrat that they're running on and thirty three days that's going to make the country a better place\nThey don't seem to care at all at what they've done with judge Kavanaugh or when you look at the evidence and you look at the facts as the FBI did now they're attacking the FBI what do you find out is that there is zero corroboration\nTo the claims of all three women in the ... not even including\nThe cases of outright lying that were dismissed early on about judge Kavanaugh they just dismiss it altogether but\nNone of this would ever make it into any court of law and there might actually end up being significant legal consequences to Julie sweat Nick and some other people based on what Alan Dershowitz and others saying should happen\nBecause of the things that they said the backtracking that took place and perhaps even lying\nUnder the threat of a felony anyway news roundup information overload our Jonathan Gillum author or sheep no more Danielle McLaughlin is with us um I don't know if this is going to impact the election and thirty three days but I think it certainly has energized every\nEvery part of the Republican coalition that recognizes this for the grave injustice that it's banned in the smear campaign that has been Jonathan\nKorea you know I think this has definitely\nCaused um some good reactions and conservatives across this nation I'm also a free thinking or people who used to subscribe to the Democrats are the Democrats' way of thinking are are now saying this is this isn't really politics this is\nI'm kind of criminal behavior the way a lot of this stuff is playing out in Washington DC right now or whether it be the boxing that we've seen 'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used and\nI think what's happening is it's solidify and people that\nThey don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome and the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west um they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause a backlash\nYou're going to defend Europe ... liberal democratic socialist party Danielle\nThat's right near the greatest show on on could opt in any everybody excited to be here I I honestly I Want to tell you that there's going to be at stake backlash on the left as well you know um there are concerns about ah the nominee a they're a consensus investigation wasn't\nDown cave but others say anyway hurdle we've heard all the allegations\nAnd know that professor Ford's so called eye witness was contradicted her testimony and her accusation\nWe know in the case of ... Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one number two or own words that she was a neighbor ended quickly had gaps in her memory\nAnd the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that this ... was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yell classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug gr and rapist of teenage girls so give me the evidence in cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from your Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not don't yeah I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute what everybody's talking\nTo it was a full and fair investigation getting married for twenty cooperating witnesses to the I think no end in the FBI added\nNo excuse me every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss Vermeer is the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so could you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect that you ... and I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happen that way at all\nThe churches are college roommate and the ... the last twenty four hours a keen about ah the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and I'm\nNot answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show how they sound like it or something\nOf course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence but I also have to leave that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI notice a talking point what I was on a second and once you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the event and the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nIs not that was can they possibly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you know you're you're trying to watch your training ... look follow the bouncing ball about ... if there is for people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got she got home\nWe don't even know the house but you mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of fellow they all said that didn't happen the way she said\nOne I Witness that didn't happen and my question is what the FBI do if they don't know the location that can't be looking parenthetically for anything quick break we'll

a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a a good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by a Democrat in the left and I just really really hope that uh that he'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a secret people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and and not be able to really recognize them and I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like it's kind of happening which us as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he may was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he had absolutely not [laughter] I'm and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we were actually related or I think it for three or four generations back a great great something grandfather is actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought\nYou would really love to know somebody told me that yesterday I might practically really\nThere is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\nUm I Hope it goes the right thing if any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delight they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here\nAnd all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no core operation of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start it you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine is religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not bear falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that's ... that's why to the extent that people can literally destroy other people within your window falls uncorroborated claims is shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh\nThey do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some point we may need to say", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show",
