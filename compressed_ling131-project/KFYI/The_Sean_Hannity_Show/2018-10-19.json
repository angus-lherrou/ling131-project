an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nUh well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats than what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to\nBe to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate and he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nBut it's really look like the Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people of New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with the chili and I've seen guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls are dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell hey where America's fans in St John and you are right\nOn fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think the New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite Sean I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those at the terrier rabid above it from my perspective you know as\nWe think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look okay\nYeah I was gonna say I I've seen the the numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did\nAnd it appears to have backfired\nParticularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nLet me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for a pillow see if you stay home it's half of ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know breast and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're going to they're going to tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually saying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not this\nPaid any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and said all Democrats should not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that didn't work for eight years dug and\nWhy why do we were told me a bit of a leading Indiana is stay or keep ice you say go the wall and he's saying oh impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out of the other Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure Sean but he is running where Democrats may be in the center and if we were as factors party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we'd be doing a lot better I think you'd probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answers on Snowden's mommy\nSocio raising enough money yeah\n... that's what it's\nAll about and and and and he's absolutely right because showing that when we asked in September and a national poll that there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want and she pulls you speaker didn't\nOnly twenty three percent of all motor suggestion fifty six percent said no\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know that they're chapter that these candidates her except for millions of dollars to to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or a willing all their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so think\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates and let me tell you it's a for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are pouring millions of dollars to the races right now\nWhat in the patio and he's ...
