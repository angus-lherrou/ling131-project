actually gets judge Brett Kavanaugh falls from the KFYI newsroom\nAnd in that application he specifically what once pages ten through twelve and Seventeen the thirty four they're also looking for the D O D J what are known as real twos and those are the conversations between bruso Warren Christopher Steele\nAnd we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker himself anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some document we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA ... with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel\nA and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true\nAh I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday and this week\nWe're going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos and some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page\nA tax uh the uh um the the Bruce or three oh one and some other things\nAll right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this and I said do you know what the news is tomorrow view getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere there there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a planet in a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm\nHearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these ...\nErnst against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted ... to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile\nRegime at and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of of their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talked about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead at the DNC\nEver get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was that when when did you first know that you were being spied on well\nI started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at ... I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this is my first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting the phone call so I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report a I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't\nWith I think first ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute\nThere's a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign\nOr were you aware of our reporting at the\nTime ... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know and these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview it in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because\nIt's all about you know media perception what are they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\nAbsolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior\nThere is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the road block that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing and it goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that\nYou should write a book what it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ... I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you ... do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and I'm going back many years again at\nAnd we had talked about how many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent total over the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean\nIn terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of documents production etcetera right now that's a whole different\nLevel when you went before a mall or what was that like you know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just because in general they have been a less leaky\nIn terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't I don't\nDeny it but I won't even I back at all absolutely not and you haven't you know and as the is it now they now stopped asking you questions one of the last time he got a call from anybody\nTax cuts work dot com do your part don't get out work this November tax cuts work dot com go there and now we continue with Carter Page who is with us in Studio today\nUm so tell me what the future lies you know for you and and I think this is all going to end soon\nIs my guest and I don't think so I don't think the president was involved in any collusion he never was I think the big story here is the abuse of power I'm putting the fix for Hillary what happened to you with the ... application warrants a I think the abuse of intelligence to weaponize thing of our intelligence is another big issue\nAnd I think there's a lot more to come I think when you hear the News Tomorrow I think you're going to be pretty shocked again that these things really did happen and I don't I in the end I don't want this to hurt law enforcement I Love law enforcement\nI Love oriental community but you can't turn the tools of intelligence as powerful as they are on the American people\nI I fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy they'll write so much is just undercover and\nYou know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations\nThey started saying well our bosses and want to [laughter] you know they I think they thought through it but they knew you know that was back during the\nConaway Mehra as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever [laughter] don't go to a lot of ...
