I can tell you a prominent person I Know I Would embarrassed them so I won't do it they never activated do you know why 'cause it beeps all the time all it takes some of the opening a door and the thing beeps dog walks through Rome it beeps I get tired of the beep so what are your habit for well we are met Wilbur not here [noise]\nSo you don't hear the beeping um\nI Know a lot of people that don't arm their systems while their home even when they're gone for just a whole host of reasons\nBut simply safe system well\nA congressional candidates and very important districts it's interesting all up there a foreigner and thirty five so they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressmen as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi\nAnd if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff as a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman\nElijah Cummings that chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing\nA phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff just when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country of pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats\nAnd if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know what I'm saying Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm going to tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't you candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called\nThen candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and and I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWith the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful\nIn other ways right now real clear politics as the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid or leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seed difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to bring on our presidents Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out\nFrom the ...

talking to our callers I Apologize I Will find out for you and circle back\nWell is that an Eighteen year high if it's an Eighteen year high was Bloomberg spending all this money throwing him at\nAt democratic candidates so the Democrats can take back the house because we haven't had this kind of economic prosperity growth for all these years now we've got four million new jobs eight million fewer Americans on food stamps and\nIn poverty we've got more opportunity than we've had over a decade for crying out loud things are growing by leaps and bounds why would we want to stop that's what the mid term elections should be about\nBloomberg and eighty eight percent of Bloomberg [laughter] that was a pretty quick thing I'm here's an interesting article so the president and millennia go to Pittsburgh today after the terrible\nShooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous\nIt is ugly is twisted it is sick it is the family story and frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard\nAt some point that you ought to be able to sue for such slander and libel those comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi\nWho watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted and he's receiving hate\nMail for saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable\nAnyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God\nIn a temple and their gun now\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from a non identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and pro\nTrump well the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue\nWas anti Trump and his Ron ... has said ambassador to Israel as a Bebe Netanyahu has said you know they've never heard any one president ever say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rush to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the ... nation is why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\n\nTenant Brenda this program she was on with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group they want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors a priest and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nYou know I call for security and peace and people do take out their differences at the ballot box\nBut that doesn't stop them they're so desperate to get noticed\nSo desperate to help their democratic allies and friends when one week from today it's pathetic\nFrankly it's slander and then of itself\nWe've got to get to the point in this country of youth skits slander you ought to be able to sue and I have a chance to win or you have to prove the absence of malice oh how about an absence of research because if they ever listened to watch\nThey seem very different Sean Hannity than the caricature that they paid when do you notice sewers barest to us in the news I mean I could not believe I was on the front\nCover of the national Enquirer it's on stands all over the country they were fair to me they actually quoted me a hundred percent accurately which never happens\nDid you notice that I did notice that it's pretty remarkable could you put\nThat up on a manatee dot com and hopefully be you go to a local grocery store the national Enquirer was fair to me\nTotally fair coated me a hundred percent accurately said okay and then at different points that I Want to make sure I got your comment right it was unbelievable\nWouldn't get that on any other network hey listen to want to remind you what's on the ballot one week from today your savings on the ballot the economy on the ballot keeping America's comeback continuing on the ballot jobs on the ballot your kid's futures on the ballot wages on the ballot\nBora one case on the ballot security on the ballot\nYou know tax cuts on the ballot\nDeregulation on the ballot\nNow you get to decide you know America's future you want the bureaucrats doing it getting back in power are you continuing with the great trajectory we're on go to this website big choice election dot com\nUh because I think they realize that this is an important race for the future of Florida that's good news for a\nWhile you got you running for Rick Scott's seat Rick Scott a would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida\nAnd I'd love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a tight race let's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved well\nThis guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it this developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that\nWere text messages release where that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby its body of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWas arrested isn't that buying influencing corruption\nWell there's an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arranged the New York junk get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime at that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so it only interested in report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that for the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he was in investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd uh which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew get one picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when a Israel fought back against the Moffett pat than may\nUh Gillum blamed Israelis they do they just use those attack as a pre K.\nIt'd be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida uh they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice and that the police needs to be funded they paid they said to us is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialist principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro wash so he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's please them proud to a snake food to dream\nDefender activists during a thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical groups\nWithout question I mean they they are in the law enforcement they're anti free enterprise there in the military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you're running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so would really up in the arrangements of millions and millions of ... that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people are burned and to force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nWants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase\nWhat what what's that going to what's the impact that is going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business said and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works in high tech date\nThey're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that went on governor buddy Andrew has his way he'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to end that if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would rape it to be higher than New York\nYeah and they also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding already in the duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nAll right and exacerbated the we we got it bad that was already got a really really bad so I'm committed to making sure that we're batting that stopping the discharges bet in order to do that\nYou gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnership I'll be able to do that you'll em wants to each track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with them on any of that say I think any of those problems we had an older\nGuy but I understand it's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess the early part of the spring and summer of this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I'm not quite frankly Michael washed I'm a bit um you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a two month stretch there in South Florida where\nPeople were just getting hammered it was in that ... that there were fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so are we didn't do whatever weekend but a lot of it as a fault you know the federal government are discharging you know all this water under the river\nA round of Santa is running for governor the great state of Florida a Rick Scott running for senator down there a it is one of the most important states Florida always is I'm a forty percent business tax by Andrew Gillum would be a disaster economically but Florida\nI Hope people waking up to the fact um and you are you how you're in the middle of early voting now and absentee voting obviously goes on and a one week from today we'll find out hopefully that you're the next governor of Florida\nOtherwise I think I'm On packing up my bags and I'm going to pull out of Florida and I'll go looking at Texas no offense\nBut my friends in Florida I got and I look I mean we're we're going to be scored and you're going to increase taxes forty percent forget it I'm Out\nI Know I Know now that the exactly right so we're going to get it done I think the folk to understand that and uh you know when I'm governor will be able to do about it I

security and Medicare standing up from that are in the mind Mm\nI'm Steve night and I approve this message\nBy twenty five now till the top of the hour that was the ad for Congressman Steve night California's twenty fifth district and there's been an influx by the way uh he's been in office by the way since like twenty Fifteen\nRunning against the Democratic challenger Katie Hill and a ton of money now we see millions of millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg who is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California\nAnd why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job with the people that state anyway he joins us now congressman how are you\nShone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ... old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat or Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of\nThese are really being targeted does tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today or how much money's being thrown at against you and towards your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a hot sauce in New York City because that's what's happening in my district or the workers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money\nYou spent in a congressional district [noise] ah that's not something my eye on it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nAnd what do you think the ... what was it ... the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people they use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd that puts you at a decided disadvantage now I kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races\nAre obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\n[laughter] I think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can or you can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republicans for very long time and we're going to win the seat [noise]\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now when people are just so upset\nI think people have a wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their at their bills and there are other male [noise] um and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox yearning for\nNow you have enough money yourself to fight back on who you are you\nGo out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand

doctor and if you like if you want to pay less you can pay less\nThe truth and the reality is tens of millions of Americans lost their doctors lost their plans and everybody paid more in spite of belied the big promise of Obamacare\nWhat is fascinating as we now head into the final week of this midterm election campaign is what Democrats won't talk about now we had earlier in the program had project baritone dot com and James O'Keefe on and he's now been able to expose\nIn Tennessee Phil Bredesen the Democrat Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp the Democrat in North Dakota\nKirsten Sinema the Democrat in Arizona that none of these people are being honest with the people in their respective states they don't want a border wall they want sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nAnd in California they want to take it a step further free health care for anybody resident non resident legal illegal doesn't matter Gavin Newsom women's out in California\nOn top of your Thirteen and a half percent state income tax\nNow Californians are going to put up a sign welcome to California the home of free health care and I'm going to tell you what's gonna happen people are going to go to California just to get free health care great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exodus out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that\nPeople with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant\nRate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lied to you about people losing their doctors that was a lie you like your doctor keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and this has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well we're we're going to where\nWe support healthcare preexisting conditions\nWell the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions\nAnd they're trying to basically go with the narrow\nLie that Republicans want you to die Republicans want dirty or water dirty air they want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist sexist massage sticking Xena phobic Islamic\nPhobic homophobic oh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump's even though the guy that shot up the synagogue he's hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now\nAre beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be blocked renting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of of new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good\nThing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors can be a
