of nearly half a million users to outside software developers this all happened last week\nGoogle\nThey shouldn't Google Plus never amounted to much of anything but they did have some people who

use my name when you sign up you know I've had a soundbites here I have a chance to get to it but CNN really didn't get a [noise]\nA trick they they play the sound by to me that was an excerpt and trying to make it look like I was of the opinion that whatever happened to them all to show me it was okay because it was a buddy of bin Laden\nAnd then you've got a case in allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard\nIt's everywhere I'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this\nHave you on a prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down\nIn Florida and through a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida Florida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best\nPolitician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd in Iran dissent this about are the great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum as we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nIs trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett is it in the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason Brett us it is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water\nAs they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets Phillips is an RV tour with with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings\nI think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we pay the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the health care costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected and what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nAt the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texans alone victims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing him a throwing those out the the door of the restaurant now it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you\nBut I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled uh Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean it's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations of new Fox a poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing\nA lot of everybody that grew up in a horrible thing a lot bigger than five thousand people and we got to stop 'em at the border\nAs many as five thousand migrants from Central America now marching through Mexico to the U.S Mexican officials are trying to process requests for members of the group that's nearly doubled in size from when they first left Honduras more than a week ago\nPresident Trump says the U.S will build up its nuclear arsenal until people come to their senses speaking on the White House lawn today the president said\nThat threat includes China Russia and anyone else who wants to play that game on Saturday Trump told the press that he intends to pull out of the missile treaty signed by both the U.S and Russia the Russian government has said it would be forced to take measures if the U.S began developing new missile systems\nAnd immigrant activists from Phoenix facing a mountain of charges in Mexico\nIt written you know he was yanked out of a crowd of thousands of migrants last week who had just forced their way into Mexico\nIs the central is reporting them but he was an organizer of a caravan last spring which led to President Trump sending the national guard troops to the border organizers of the latest migrant caravan say he has been released but he's been ordered not to leave the country until his cases resolved Jason Kidd but don't you have five fifty KFYI I knew I was looking\nAt

Mexico while others wage\nThat's part of the story the president now has alerted the military to be on standby for possible deployment orders to the U.S southern border\nI mean this is in every word you know I remember I think Michelle Malcolm wrote a book years ago called invasion\nThe American people I Know the Democrats they're thinking this is their moment this is good for them I don't I don't see how any of this is good for the\nDaily Caller has a piece out saying that the majority of people in the care of on not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports that this new way above\nOf heroin banners is comprised quote a mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants you know\nBy a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white and then of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross\nInto Mexico and this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I'd been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times\nI have seen it it's wide open what are we gonna what's gonna happen and we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be\nPrecipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan or as make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally that is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty they're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies\nThat allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there well you know it just I mean the ... it's basically a national\nEmergency if you look at it\nYou have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan and report friday said that they have met people from bank a legit dash\nThat are joining the people from Guatemala into Mexico Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana reported that the bridge separating ... while the mullah in Mexico the bridges ... packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico this was going back to friday the ultimate goal crossing into the U.S illegally\nShe writes the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly [noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing their march\nNow a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from\nThe Rio Grande the San Diego helicopter horseback boats\nAll terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there so and the entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me uh I've been to the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that of that had been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is gonna win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and\nGet the free health care

personal EKG divide but just Ninety nine dollars to order the Amazon dot com and type cardio mumbling\nOrder they want to continue their policies of sanctuary cities and sanctuary states eliminating ice and open borders now we know what they're real position is but what are they going to advise the president to do is fourteen thousand people now are heading towards that border\nNot a good position for anybody to be in the president is committed not only to cutting off aid to the countries that are allowing this to happen which you should do\nBut also he's put our military I noticed that he may have to send them down and that people are not going to be walking across our border elite illegally this is what's happening every day just singing and one larger number one's here\nOther anecdotal evidence out there Joe Biden can't even get five hundred people to show up in ... in Vegas to see him speak\nWhich is not a great idea which is not great evidence that there's any energy on the left but with that said there's always the risk that you're going to wake up sixteen days from now we're Fifteen days till election day in the morning after the day before\nYou're going to hear oh speaker elect Nancy Pelosi oh you're going to here's you know Senate majority leader elect Chuck Schumer\nAnd that means more open borders that means the lemonade ice that means keep Obamacare the mitigated disaster it's been\nThat means that taxes will be raised because they didn't want you getting the crumbs in the first place and of course impeach Trump investigate Trump nonstop anyways ah

in the country on behalf of candidates how's it looking for you and they are so well and it's\nGood to be ... I think we're going to be fine ah but yeah we're ... we've been here in South Carolina last friday there were all over the place\nYou only get interesting to watch the states like California Southern California it's six important house seats that could be the the ... the balance of power in the house Minnesota has important races Ohio does Michigan does Pennsylvania and New York and New Jersey do\nYeah no I think in the end of Sean\nWhen you look at the radical positions the leftist take I Would argue the most extreme positions in American history where they you know they applied tap particularly this respect the flag they Iran Governor Cuomo when he said America was never that grade and they they embrace Maxine Waters when she got harassed anybody support our president\nContracts that isn't for where they want to take the country\nAs we've talked about before with what the president has accomplished at Twenty one month with his leadership in this country taxes regulations down economy growing it for ... percent lowest unemployment forty years course each and cabin on the court out of the Iran deal embassy in Jerusalem and on and on we could go\nSo those are the competing visions those are the kind that's the contrast\nI think when American step back and look they're going to pick Republicans or we're going to keep the majority in the house\nBetween no due process for Kavanaugh\nNo presumption of innocence for Kavanaugh these of core values that have served us well a as a country\nAnd then you've got this lawless caravan and I I don't hear a single Democrat saying we've got to stop what is it looks like an invasion fourteen thousand people just want to run across the border maybe more and if that happens what's gonna happen after that\nIt's like a party that is basically given up on the rule of law unconstitutional and the values that have served a so well over these many years\nExactly right or the most extreme positions ... got closer with this comment you got\nFormer Secretary Clinton said oh yeah we'll get civil in once we have\nPower that's not really supposed to be this great nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you've got this caravan merging thousands and thousands of people [noise] um I think the president is right when he's talking about you know going to get your foreign aid if this if this is going to continue\nAnd talking about putting hooks on the border putting troops on the border ... National Guard in order to make sure there's\nAlways what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and the president saying you must respect the laws and sovereignty or you know I I think Democrats ally go in the back of their heads hoping this happens southern all maybe something bad will happen and Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you never know I Hope I Hope not I prayed not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady couldn't is that the Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said\nI'm In I'm sick of this kind of stop she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted a choice for her goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications and motivations behind these think\nThat's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come this to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming asylum aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem that we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nAlso have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen\nSecretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders or we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now carry Kissinger was shouted downloads in some of this [laughter]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served as countries you know it's unbelievable you know what the ... you know ... uh what's her name Maxine Waters you\nHe'd be Tammy Duckworth now us a senator from the state of Illinois he beat her in that election Peter Roskam knows how to win so we have good candidates across the country who I think know how to win and these top top climate\nBut again I think when you look at where the left wants to take this country I think most people with how much it's going to say I didn't sign up for that I'm going to keep Republican control and the great economic gains that we've seen under the leadership or the president\nDo you think the cabin on hearings the caravan the mobs um coupled with the president's success ... is is there a base out there that we're not hearing from the polls are picking up yet\n[noise] I think that's very likely I mean we haven't necessarily seen it we haven't really polled but when you anecdotally around talking with folks use that you feel that that people are in fact moving a in that direction and and were outraged by what they owe happened to a judge capital\nAnd what are the your house members it Freedom Caucus guys how's Dave Brat doing it now we're going to actually talk to Scott Perry at the last half hour how are those guys doing it because they're in their new operations are\nThey are they're doing great but I'll I'll give you the best examples rod blow up he was down like ten twelve point three weeks ago he's now got within one point that's what happening because our guys are working hard good candidates working hard at the American people are waking up to the ridiculous positions at all that's what this country to\nRide Jim Jordan thanks for being with us when we come back we'll we'll check in with congressman Perry we'll get to some of

November the sixty three term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district and\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of Pennsylvania's Supreme Court decision\nOr they decided read don't draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nThat the hand you're dealt and or any way a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting doesn't they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this read this book they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things they're doing the course the big thing they're doing which go or not just doing it to be you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nOr it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it and that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know\nThey're the ones that screwed up our health care system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right and now they're blaming us for messing it up\nUm we try to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put what thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the British you know the Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original a bill\nOut of a you know the ... the replacement bill for Obamacare 'cause if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original built that deal with

very specific\nBattle and in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate has gone I mean all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young\nAnd healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want being forced by law to

know you get a crowded you follow these people and to grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else and throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using ... with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book uh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle a blue collar Americans had won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like to weigh judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards the late in the rape arising a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors Asian big caravan issue the way they're handling the Caribbean issue it's a galvanizing his base that cabin all thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next sugar to okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you know\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two which again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so\nFor me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so once again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly\nAh keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the order tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are well we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S\nNow we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's a she says all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows ... they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\nResponse all you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more bottom\nThe bottom ... percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but\nAlso the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is that you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but\nThere's no moderation left either mulch and the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or\nDisaster for a country a person a citizen and you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it but the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Malone\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed the second amendment also responsible gun owners\nThat's why we're friends with the U.
