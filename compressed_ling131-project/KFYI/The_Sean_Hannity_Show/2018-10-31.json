doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shock and correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages\nNancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about their ... they're not being any

wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or where the way the Republicans having the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did a forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally a I had my personal range is returning the bottom of about two oh one which would mean below sea ...

[noise]\n[noise]\nYou know when they go low low low we will just do different things about\nAmerica has got to look America's gonna make a choice there is now a movement that has evolved Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats are extinct it is one party one voice leaning solidly socialist left\nVersus those that believe in our constitutional republic limited government greater freedom less government intrusion into our lives I think that is the fundamental disagreement\nTraditional two totally different Americans you know there there are America's one in which we don't teach American history we don't want to be American I'm not proud of the flight motion so you could count on a motion to leave the star Spangled Banner\nUh and uh you know we're just one more normal country there ought to be subordinate to the un and national bureaucrats\nNo wonder because we're the wealthiest country in the world oh we're only seeing huge amounts of money to coax a because they'd like to be wealthy chew on is the tiny chance that they don't have the money isn't it like you I mean it's just amazing to watch and serious\nUm these folks are and how much they would basically undermining America for the purpose of idea unless\nThere's a lot at stake I think the most you know if you're barely pay close attention the Democrats stand for nothing except painting Trump wanting their crumbs back open borders not anything that's going to improve the lives of the forgotten men and women in this country but there's just because you spend a lot of time with us today we really appreciate it thank you and five or six days now to election day I'm sure\nWe'll talk before the election and afterwards and get your take on the results so thanks for being with us for two\nOr an eight hundred nine four one showing us our number\nI saw was the last time you and your family just gather around a table and play a game together I don't know probably maybe never in some cases\nMay sound old fashioned but you've got all of sudden me the new board games that are coming out there really amazing and you got to try it one I've been telling you about which way Druze it's a party game\nBy the way only takes thirty minutes to play everybody all ages can play it it's simple to learn nor the game is going to bring families together like what's in waitress\nI've been talking about it for years what people tell me the feedback I get\nFrom people that have played it but we all start playing everyone puts their bones downloaded devices down and we actually connected the family and real memories are created by the way you can get which is an waiters this week target is running a a special you buy a game or two you can get with some waitress for free\nIt's the wits waitress party game which is in wages the perfect time to get it with the holidays coming up we'll just had on over to your local target ... wit and waitress at target today\n\nThe economy is strong until it's not the U.S debt to GDP ratio highest in nearly Seventy years in in times of economic uncertainty we turn to\nGold we're sandstorm gold royalty and we've been building a diverse gold portfolio in two thousand tonight we're different kind of pulled company we purchased royalty on select mining operations and receive a percentage of their revenue in return the royalties differ from other golden at Stanford or gold royalties dot com\nIs not an office that were so many like ... ... kills you just taken lives destroyed families and ruined childhoods\nWe need to take action immediately the missile field a patient registry active twenty Seventeen would create a patient registry for researchers cancer and a a less habits missile researchers needed to we need to find a cure\nOrange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they have zero zero in on us\nThis was really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California raised as being not important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know\nWho controls ... the the house or come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this was a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can money yeah exactly yeah so\nTell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money in the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear or do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that um the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we had over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... being returned over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS eat\n'em and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job of the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\n[noise] it's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have Fort team members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that uh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where the pendulum swings back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we get\nOne of the problems that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York\nIllinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of and a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy our first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is\nThat unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles we may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention to Southern California you know have and this is the headline which I think is pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nOr and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California\nThese races all will tip the balance of power and if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for ... I Hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nIt's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day\nLet's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and has done a thing for upstate New York\nAnd the fact that Pennsylvania takes all of the natural gas from New York and they were allowed to frack and you see the economy booming and the other side of that border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and then I I'm\nIn that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago and matter of fact it was five years ago today on health care as a situation because when they rolled out before it ... it became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and\nUm I pay extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's has that I've had 'em that are no longer covered and uh yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up\nYet again and less coverage getting gang for tests and things that used to be covered and I'm just I Want everybody to get out there and vote\nBecause we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was calling to talk about the health care\nI've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody there's now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care we're going to ... I'm like you're the same idiots they gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep her plans have less and\nFundamental ... it's been a failure and the fact that it was true none of it was true was one of

had you know groups like ... von and others you know paying for a recount other ballads and they found enough new votes\nThat were not counted to\nOr what not conducted the voters to swing the election is that pretty accurate what happened to you know\nI actually think county had more votes than voters and that they've they've flipped it by a hundred and twenty nine votes of the two point

we were gonna have to prove how those votes were actually care\nWell why wouldn't you just use a calculator saying this number of voters and the number of votes and they don't add up and that that
