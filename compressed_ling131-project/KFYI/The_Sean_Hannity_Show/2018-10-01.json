email is well they are now putting out a list of we got an interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remember Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor forward\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's

they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that but what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goal post now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality the fact is\nThis is nothing to do with\nTraditional

you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the

go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm

their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me it would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me let me play historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh\nDeceiving example though you're getting Blumenthal who is the president was pointing out\nIs terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't\nKnow suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty speaking about the defenders of slavery who were prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose then\nPlainly stated his that he will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all events close quote I Dreamed I brought that up on his I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe's not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them in the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at that at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promise last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know at an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer and longer longer which means what we've all suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it\nWhen you are but the point is I think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that has made here by the American people\nBecause if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is nobody's ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever oh not at all we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the ... and history of the left if they can do to counter and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do it to your son\nI mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team a total liar total fabrication trend over a year or is a cloud over this\nAnd men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left is is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation they they don't think the truth matters what matters is power and I think people need to understand\nThis election is a choice about which America we're going to become much made a choice in just the president this is literally about are we going to reward people who are just destructive and who are willing to cripple their own country in order to get power or are we going to repudiate them\n[noise] Arizona\nSenator Jeff flake has people ...\nAbout twenty twenty run the KFYI newsroom I'm Deborah Dale Senator Jeff flake appearing at the

I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm ... you can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial that's fine you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that ... every Democrat that that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master control in the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible partisan organization\nIt out it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nTo hear jokes that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerk for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with in any way\nOn and he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times twelve to fourteen different times they've found now they've vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but it\nI think you're right on the parents to do on a reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your habits are very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them it was what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nNow I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says ... look he he told me coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate and they're with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list of people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statements in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez contacted a former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed\nThemselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know\nWhat are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is eating right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even still share it with him she said why did he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York and they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm I'm In ... or even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what\nFor the FBI could talk to her um they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to include holy wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those three oh two we've been waiting for three oh two forever as
