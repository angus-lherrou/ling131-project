{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Yeah that that's a really kind of thinking about and you know I don't want to to to short them on credit here they're really good at as you said at a sniffing out their own that happen to be sick because you want to quarantine those individuals\nBefore they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyone of at a path to being as a fungus or some other sort of disease that the thing that has evolved over many millions of years and ants which then as you mentioned the fungus hassle\nThan skirt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume would smell a little different than a typical and\nSo because they have this really intricate unique system of missing out bad actors in the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing the ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago this is in fact\nThat they found fossils that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characteristic bite marks of the aunt in them which presumed that the fungus had\nBeen doing this for a long time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the and in the colony but that might get it found out in that would get it dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you just stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article to it has to drive all its host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms in the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus if ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree [laughter] so you know this is as I mentioned this was an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem\nPossible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex because the ant colony is it self extremely complex and able to sniff out this sort of manipulation is the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball\nTo avoid detection and really pull off this\nStunningly complex devious manipulation\nThat's how we get this zombie I mean here it's so delicate that process in infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus has the time it right so that when the end is leaving the colonies that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight the leaf and everything is just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does a originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in a South Carolina I think uh we have a at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ...\nTo bite onto the vein of all if that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened to share in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is the fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the vein of relief but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a\nPerch that it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a perch it's easier to get a purchase on the vein of relief I biting into it so that actually happens here in the United states as as the\nFungus there's ordering the aunt to bite onto the twig it's not such a good purchase but\nThen orders the answer rap its legs around the twigs and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that\nStem and that's just all the more power to to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because\nIn the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forest where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and it will over winter just sitting there on a stem biding his time and then once the spring comes around it will then finally arrived out of the back of a head\nOf the ... as it does and the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to month upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adapted to really ruin the day of the ants in a in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead tell us about the book\nYeah so that turns out that the fungus is just one of the many many manipulators among parasites in the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across different species the worms do it to crickets their war or to the crickets the jump into water which is not\nOf course great for the credit which can drown or you can buy fish and it's at that point the worms are up and then made\nThat's a particular kind of manipulation rabies actually is a a very well known parasitic manipulated that does it usually to raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the ...\nAny of these allegations whatsoever member that\nAnyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take Al Franken side\nAnd you know it is [noise] you know you just got to watch this\nIt there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they get a no vote on Brecht capital that's just this this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's going to which by the way the way to do it you don't like Trump go beat him\nIn thirty six days Democrats they'll make their case\nAnd they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi in the Senate Democrats to Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results\nIt'd be a stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do you want all progress that we have now achieved in two years to\nThat'll happen too but all the senators saying well\nNo no no we got to limit the scope but it's got to be very quick expeditious and and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is pretty court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor forward there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably were\n... I I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed by\nThe Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that every Democrat that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master control in the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLifelong reputation here on the line\nTo hear your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit and the lower court judge the Supreme Court\nSaid it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times like twelve to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a\nHat but I but I think you're right on the parents' reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because you know well the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the ages no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's the political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habits are very different thing to sit across from ... special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them others what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI endless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says if you look in his company's coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and this is just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to live the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate\nAs their ... with a investigator it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that there there's my prediction\nBy announcing that morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on against the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a single one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people she's not even still share it with him she said what part of that he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain to get hit its him so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York and they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I mean ... even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what\nFor the FBI can talk to her um they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to include holy wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very hand over the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those three oh two we've been waiting for three oh two forever as it relates to Bruce or in an Christopher Steele and and what was said those comments\nAnd as we continue Sean Hannity show were from our nation's capital as we check in with Christian is in Idaho Christian Hi how are you glad you called\nThanks for taking my call I just wanted to mention the whole double standard between a victim's from Clinton President Clinton and then how Hillary accused dirty killed all her all the all the people that she abused and then\nYou got Keith Ellison where there's plenty of evidence and accusations against him well there was no best occasion but\nIt's basically the double standards\nIf they hear that you're raising a great point if they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations we can go back now to Juanita Broderick and we can certainly go back to Keith Ellison where there's Dr reports and\nText messages and audiotape maybe even a videotape of him\nYou know being emotionally abusive physically abusive towards his ex girlfriend so yeah I think that would be a consistent opposition for them to take but they never ever going to do that are they\nPretty much it promotes the Democrat agenda\nWell that's it I mean that's what it all comes down to politics alright Christian good call we appreciate it All right let's go to Don is an Iowa Don how're you we got about a minute it's all yours sir\nHi shot at you for taking my call and thank you for a continually bringing up the true for everybody\nI'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that I'm for it\nIs perfectly willing to do to judge Kavanaugh what she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting a him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and then just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves she gave the names of four people\nAnd none of the fork and corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it\nAt that point they were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today I got to take a quick break final have power\nFree for all our Sean Hannity show and we will continue from our nation's capital Hannity tonight nine eastern on Fox\nAnd you're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show well up more of your favorite gas topics and memorable moments that's all coming up [noise] [noise]\n\nHi Michelle mocking here if you found them I work you know the one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now\nAnd how the woman goes you know when it comes out of debt and there's no police report and\nI helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions directly from governor regions office not to expect of course\nWhen you got him when he came around I jumped I personally donated to make sure the film ... main God no movie opens open your mouth to me\nCormac God's know as perhaps the most ...

[noise]\nAnd now for you Democrats and I guess I'm including you to the media right I consider you what part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats to be\nTalking about we want more time for the FBI if you wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bring this up\nI I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot and so I don't know whether it'd be big discrepancy yes go ahead please can you found you know what really ... you've had enough\nBy twenty five now till the top of the hour we're in our nation's capital the sewer the swamp Washington DC toll free our telephone number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program a obviously a lot happening here this week thirty six days until the all important midterm elections\nAre my friend and colleague from the Fox news channel is with those Tucker Carlson got a brand new book out by the way it's called ship a fool's how was selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution and in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where\nA party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president um but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the\nAt is what's you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital\nUntil two weeks ago yesterday and look where we argue they Tucker welcome to the show\nThanks Sean well yeah I mean look\nCap now is being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do that because he's in the way\nOf the Democrats retaining power it's not personal it's just the party wants what he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it\nAre we moving to a revolution while I don't look at the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division honest are pushing racial division endlessly\nThey're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not soccer ... women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them\nTo control that divide and conquer it's my older strategy there\nWell you know look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't give the whole list but is likely they want to throw granting over the cliff\nAnd now with Supreme Court justices or if they have an opening it there seems to be no ... there's nothing they won't say or do now I mean your friends of the attorney for professor cats\nYou know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself is pretty radical left now soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is\nAnd asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people and the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement\nBetween a senator Coons and not enough in honor of snow like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that tastes when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon Sanchez and Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be racist watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron descent as as a racist you know it was going to happen because it had to happen\nA lot greater there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad and Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know elect Republicans black cross a cost is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learn anything and so ... got mad at punish them are good for them but why would\nSo that's I that's what I think my job is to explain workers me and I think maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think in the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I don't it like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway to give\nThem a little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence\nWhy don't you know they're you know what I mean there are less than nine ... there was a handful of us Tucker there's not that many ... and by the way it\nIs a orchestrated effort in millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website ... dot com\nThe ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution Tucker Carlson is with us here show every night week

I'm Glad you had to talk around there earlier um I grew up watching ... you cannot cross fire reminded me and my dad who were just he just died a few weeks ago and so I think you'd be happy recalling him getting on to your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there was an amazing show and it's time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows and uh during those things that people want to mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation number one for so where conservatives we have a moral compass if we if we do detect but there's something wrong then he should be thrown overboard that's number one okay that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans to investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use its power\nTo investigate everything that's going on here and potentially witnesses being coached ally people being put forward assigned false affidavits\nThere's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the Republicans were going to allow such an investigation of\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita broader it's FBI investigation\nThey don't want any of these things because it's not the issue with politics the greatest evidence that his politics anyway appreciate the call of the latest on Brett Kavanaugh it's going to spend\nA lot of time taking your calls final hour the program news roundup information overload our as we continue from Washington Hannity tonight we've got a very important show nine eastern on the Fox news channel quick break right back will continue [noise]\nThis is the best of the Sean Hannity show don't forget stay tuned for more right after the latest news right here on this radio station [noise]\nSenator Graham of South Carolina joins us right now he's on the Senate Judiciary committee a senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a vote on Kavanaugh and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\n... I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of this agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here laser Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalposts Jeff voted yes in committee\nWhen the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to mend by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one it said the goal was to go away\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy and twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for marriage as isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do\nA there your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I Am but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but it'd be a full one vote short you up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused on not given up on him less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yes most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump test ride they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes\nI don't believe the FBI is going to find anything\nA relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... towards claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it but there was a big don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care there's like you know I'm a bad business I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it\nMissiles ... kills you just taken lives destroyed families and ruined childhoods we need to take action immediately the missile field a patient registry active twenty Seventeen would create a patient registry for researchers\nCancer and a a less

our radio music\nYou'll miss the core of the best of the Sean Hannity show coming out\nSean Hannity is broadcasting now on over five on radio stations around the world to know Sean nasty\n... says she became aware of efforts by Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge spike pine Chet parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she saw either man's spike it the Brett\nKavanaugh [noise] you know fighting a punch whatever I I I I saw him get a random fellow cops clashing girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch that when the malls or the punch campaigner is\nI don't know why he in fact I saw him by them or their financial remember these parties Taylor remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that\nAnd we have we haven't heard from us faster so asking tell their people live in today I had a party so yeah there are people that know that they have\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweat Nick another friend she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five down till the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how does this past for a news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago\nYou would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a a a systemic\nParty culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up outside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborate adjust the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news hindered in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there's not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the gold posed we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nByron hey Sean listen on the on the ... thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds about it\nA war on on the basis of the lack of governance and all\nAh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bought it was given in part a due to the news networks um Kramer about Michael I have an ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if it was recorded this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are ... there was nothing to this story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nLike you're telling the truth that's what they say\nWell now we have the Democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down and Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants an investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ballgame and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about is drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drank too much beer but they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out correct so this is a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here's objects question right go ahead where things could change yeah\nI'm from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations to worse he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr are they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York with us Anchorage on Washington

thank you what's going on\nI'm just curious about uh everybody including our side are calling I'm Dr Ford a credible she might be a very sympathetic to the fall\nYou know ... I'm ... I'm here or whatever you want to call her but\nShe sympathetic but she's not credible and that goes to by by the expert opinion of a prosecutor as a specialist in this field prosecutor Mitchell says that this wouldn't even make the minimum requirements to get a warrant let alone presented in court\nWas an I don't really have anything I I I think this is such a serious topic I I literally nothing\nAll bad to say about professor Ford I don't like that Dianne Feinstein hooked up with a a radical left wing attorney who's known for going after the Paula Jones while it was only ten or twelve minutes um that's Bill Clinton\nArkansas exposing his pain is insane kiss it ah that ten or twelve minutes she says doesn't meet the definition of sexual harassment in the workplace so\nThe results are now in polling and we're seeing it in the Fox news poll that now shows that are Heidi Heitkamp who is a no on judge cabin on North Dakota she down by eleven it's going to be interesting to watch what Joe Manchin does Joe Donnelly in Indiana is a no\nUh we know Claire McCaskill is a no we ah have a battle going out Martha ... I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy is simple that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nAll that it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even halt and you see Republicans and important Senate races now and dead heat in all of the states that are red states where where Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice calving off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they ... they did everything you can imagine\nAnd they lost and I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he in the process he may well have crippled his party or a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things\nThey're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats\nAnd he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we have been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever ... nature of politics they can bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor before there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nTo to look for anything parenthetically that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eyewitness that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decay into\nAlmost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I founded painful um he he makes comments like that I mean here about people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know this other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps or you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the the new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is\nEliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high and we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressman or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWell he has put your finger on the key question of the selection I've as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\n[noise] one on one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas\nRight down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back in the special in one um and is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWith this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote\nAnd if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would thrust behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before you became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and\nAnd you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the
