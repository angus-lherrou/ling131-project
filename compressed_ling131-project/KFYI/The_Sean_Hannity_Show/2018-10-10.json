{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Today's Donald Trump approval ratings among black voters thirty five percent in the Rasmussen report survey\nThis day last year was twenty three percent so in one year Trump's approval rate among African Americans as jumped from twenty three percent to thirty five percent no matter how you feel about polls eight twelve point jump in a year\nIs significant because I'm telling you folks in the you you know this\nEvery presidential race Ninety percent eighty eight Ninety two percent of the black vote goes Democrat if that number ever became Seventy percent the Democrat Party would be up the TPP they would be in deep doo doo\nAnd they know it and everybody else knows it\n\nNow there's twelve point increase this is especially true and surprising considering the constant drumbeat from the press that Trump is a racist\nPig somebody's not buying it and it's not just Kanye West if this number grows just a little bit the Democratic party is as I say in deep TV\nAnd there is a story here celebrity insider and Jay Z and Beyonce the are completely done with Kim ... Kanye West after ... latest ethics Kanye is shed you'll have ... a lunch with Trump the oval office tomorrow\n[noise] somebody told me if that happens to be a big mistake Trump need not have lunch with some celebrity after this hurricane said don't do it cancel it\nI said no take Kanye West you if you go down there in view of the disaster put ... put Khan you're on a jet and go down there and survey and that's how you have lunch with it and you don't break the dates that came along with you [noise]\nThat's what I told them to do anyway you know we like success stories around here folks and everybody here is a success story many of you in this audience are success stories simply safe is a success stories and\nWe love them we love optimistic positive achievement we love\nSuccess and success stories simply safe is one of them there are a lot of reasons to appreciate what simply safe as a cheap they took on an established market\nThe homes security market whether it's totally brand new way of doing it\nAnd it was understandably away and it was going to require people to be somewhat technologically educated fluent\nSimply save his home security company that is growing by leaps and bounds because so many\nPeople in this audience have come to rely on them for a safe for homeless safer or apartment a safer condo yeah it's right you can have a security system in an apartment or your rent now or in a condominium\nSimply safe has built a really good home security system using technology in New ways\nTo start with the fact that built to operate on why fight no wires that is so huge terms of installation in terms of trouble shooting problems\nIn terms of saving time no wires means no construction I mean it's the biggest deal here\nCellular is used for the monitoring the base station that knows whether or not your house have been broken into her caught fire to call the cops are the fire department no wires at all\nAnd because of that it is easy to set up and it's easy\nTo use they made sure it works in the event of power outages or downed wires it'll all work and unlike our home security companies simply safe never asked you to sign a contract\nWhen you utilize the monitoring service other outfits do you got ... two year contract and promised to spend fifty dollars a month or more for simply say for the monitoring is fourteen Ninety nine than its\nMonthly go on line simply safe usa dot com you'll get ten percent off if you buy a system at that website\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow\nThen make its way up the coast through Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher ... over a million power outages we expected occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so ah everybody if if you're in if you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina if you're in North Carolina\nYou know you can make their preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in in harm's way today this was this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to pay this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst\nThe worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas they're going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half\nHe is the person in May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim Cole me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller\nHe is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth buys a application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the price of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by\nAnd of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legally expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nAnd he is denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nAnd the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as Mick Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying\nDiddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warns that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they know the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the CIA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true it's just wrong intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially if the application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first it gets to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the cooperation of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only\nWe don't have an election day we have an election\nArizona political consultants stand Barnes president have gone for a steak consulting group says early voting changes all strategy for candidates who want to win elections\nThere isn't a higher other campaign going on at the grassroots level\nHe says these early

because you've got money in your pocket your taxes are lower red tape is less the Washington bureaucracy smaller and you actually get to find your own future that manic a difference\nWell look you know as well as I Do there's only been three times in the last hundred years where the party that wins the White House ends up picking up seats in in Congress and their first midterm election now the last time that that happened was after the nine eleven attacks in two thousand and two\nAnd I think the country was so unified at that moment that there was no desire to change of power in any way shape or form I think before a judge Kavanaugh I was a little worried about the enthusiasm gap that existed between Republican voters and democratic voters\nAre that gap has now closed completely and in most instances when there's a tie that means that's a huge advantage for Republicans because pollsters don't tend to get that right\nRight well let's look now you mentioned I mean one of the key samples of why the next few weeks you're going to become Republican weeks Kevin McCarthy just introduced a bill that says basically look here's your choice\nYou want to stop ... now from killing people going to stop carfentanil which is even worse than many people you want to stop opioids coming in from Mexico you want to start feeling trafficking coming into Mexico you want to stop and I was Thirteen coming in Mexico you got to control the border and he got the first bill that actually says unequivocal they\nWere going to control the border now what are the Democrats are\nThey're offering open borders\nEither abolish or shrink he's sanctuary city\nSo the Democrats are saying look\nWe feel really bad that your child may die of an opioid overdose we feel really bad\nThat your neighborhood school may be terrorists but I Am a search team faster all were left wing ideologues and you can expect us to be practical so why don't you go along with us because you know that's the right thing to do is open up America and let every drug dealer every human trafficker\nAnd and every single Emma searching gang member of the country I think if that's the choice in a lecture on you and I don't have to fast because we're going to be ... for the lectures on like we have not seen in our lifetime\nWell I ... I Believe now firmly that you know all the people that have been claiming a blue wave a blue wave and blow away can be shocked again just like they weren't twenty sixteen and they were only a couple of us that believe that that was even possible and ah I think one indicator of just how far left the Democratic party has gone is\nOut in California the sanctuary state of California and you have Gavin knows new sitting running up against this business guy by the name of what was his first name John Cox\nDon ... and and cuts is now in a five point almost within the margin race against Gavin Newsom and one of the biggest issues to emerge is not only the sanctuary cities status of the whole state but\nThe proposal of gab a nuisance to provide free health care to anybody does it matter is you know resident California citizen non citizen does it matter\nEverybody gets free health\nCare what kind what kind of asking me what it is those who have ... just cause I can think of I don't do this and you're driving keep your eyes open but everyone is not try to close your eyes to second and think about\nGavin Newsom is proposing at a time when Senator Feinstein has ... who's an open borders bill and by the way President Trump's been very clear on this last couple of days the Democrats in the Senate every single Democrat Senate\nAs co sponsored the Feinstein open borders bill so now what the Democrats are proposing to us following we're going to have open borders anybody who wants to can come in because offer them free health care ... ... talk now just\nYou know apply your common sense world wide among billions of people weren't going to go out within days if you have an illness get to California they want to take care of you\nI mean how many people do we think are going to show up who need health care well what if you don't have health care\nAnd you live in Alabama where you live in Missouri or you live in Michigan or I wouldn't mind driving out to California if I needed Syria significant health care\nWho's going to pay for it now they said income tax I\nThought about that that's a great idea I never thought about the notion [laughter] pilot right screw you set it\nWherever I wrote a very dark actually I think he'd go ahead\nNo no no no I'm impressed that you know this is one of those times when you take it is totally off my feet [laughter] happening right who's Klan\nCould apply to every American so what we can say ... around the country is one of the California\nGavin Newsom the mayor and ship them out there for ... you know middle of the health care costs ... every other state and then the union everybody gets sick go to California Gavin Newsom offered you a free diet or something\nIs going to save every state in America [laughter]\nI never thought I gotta I gotta think Arthur Sean this ... by the time I Do your show tonight\nThey are going to be in your enemy haven't gotten us when you go to work on the property totally off guard a better you know it's\nNot easy to get to getting rich off guard I Will say that I'm actually\nYeah there there have been times when you know you have warned me as the you know what we're really family I've gotten to know you so well I consider you and your the Kennedy family\nAnd you know but you know you're you're always you know quick to tell me you're out on a limb again you're out there in ... what are you doing you know you you don't have the tape and tell me when you think I'm going to\nFar he wanders around now when I'm totally amazed you know what I Want\nI Want the country that when I'm sick of winning and I'm Glad we have ... million more Americans working ending burdensome regulation a chance that energy independence the wall\nIs being built if we can found the rest of it I'm I'm happy about you know all of the the renegotiate trade deals I think it's more secure world and I ...

warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears\nThat the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out that in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in there for that

fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked\nWhich is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim call me\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't wanna have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews and those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers with it\nThere's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member a end by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nThat took place in that meeting back between

I. B. L. E. email and\n[noise]\n\n\nWe can you\nCongressman Jim Jordan and congressman mark\nMeadows All right so the next step then is what I mean do we do I need to give out the numbers are Trey Gowdy is office and chairman Goodlatte stop us and say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein why why I don't know why that would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number in your ... holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it your list interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work\nToday or to\nTo stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that\nThe deputy attorney general must come yet\nHe must raise is right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that are really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI had not shown we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with the FBI remember Mr ... told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact present the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we went to see all those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve adult\nSo the so called trio too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see and more importantly the American people need to see\nWhat would you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please too old to two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on they should\nDemand that he testify under oath or thank you so much congressman Mark Meadows thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your push for the truth we need to get to the bottom of the [noise]\nAll right we've got to take a break when we come back we've got a lot more to come down ... more on this also the latest on this hurricane that his pounding the Florida Panhandle as we speak hurricane Michael I'm much more Hannity tonight nine eastern on the Fox news channel we got a great show will tell you about that in a minute [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHi Michelle milk and hear the gods now movie opens in October twelve dean Cain and the entire kept her job bringing

most is that home advisor is completely free do you go to ... dot com or download the ... to get darn it\nIs the used car five fifty KFYI Phoenix Jay y o da de do Phoenix set I ours radio station [noise]\nMichael Flynn was the drug's a source of his us in nearly fifty years from the KFYI use your mind\nGreg Barton Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle this afternoon just shy of a category five storm with one hundred and fifty seven mile per hour winds Appalachian coal a resident Alan ... says the winds are frightening\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics to the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic sober folks kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back down looking back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out\nAnd if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that somehow the Republican\nAnd can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim you\nReally can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nEnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ... end up this rage ... not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you\nHave to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the cabinet so that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nDonald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nBrock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up that I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduce which was a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall a the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big\nIssues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\nYeah and and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... importance to American businesses American individuals\nMoms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection it may come up and I ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually\nWorried what will happen to the country if that seat if Ginsburg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open has the potential\nAlready nervous about the steady rise in government bond yields Fox's Jerry Walls reports from the floor of the New York stock exchange\nChairs a sell off and almost every sector of course they sell off was really written by technology that flying back in July level of care really dialing back by the time to July losing out quite a bit of ground here I Am doing the same thing as well\nWe'll have the closing numbers coming up hurricane Michael is packing a punch as the strongest storm to hit the U.S nearly half a century Michael made landfall this afternoon as a category ... storm of the Florida Panhandle National Hurricane center director Ken Graham says the storm is still packing dangerous when\nYou're talking about we're still looking at you know category three of these wins well inland and when you start off that strong it's going to take a while to start knocking down those when so we still see some damaging hurricane force winds and by the way right now and looks like we're starting to enter a getting into Georgia\nPrior to hurricane Michael the strongest storm to hit the United states with hurricane Camille back in Nineteen sixty nine\nA high end Japanese restaurant that's a favorite with celebrities is coming to the valley nobody will open its first Arizona restaurant in Scottsdale as part of fashion squares new luxury wing\nJeff ...

official meteorologist at the Sean Hannity show with weather bell dot com well everything you predict that as we talked earlier in the program today has come true this is a bad bad storm it's they're now in the middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating than we even thought it could be\nWell we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I I you know and my dad used to always say to me the if you have to tell somebody said something you must not set of loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually a we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people bad it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay so you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come in fact I talked to Shaun ...\nOn the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf War right now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up everything got together and that's why and you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective is the worst storm ever to hit between mobile camp I that I can find on records\nOkay now you know whether ten thousand years ago something hit worse so we're not sugarcoat that\nBut on the other hand if not because of your educate All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years\nIncluding Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that Camille did that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida which weakening off its peak most of these hurricanes and we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's it it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're going to go in and look at the damage\nBut there's a lot more left to this storm folks because even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia I got to be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour\nAt ... you will escaped the worst but I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very close to Columbia South Carolina just north of pay a bill by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then it will move off the mid Atlantic Coast between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk, Virginia very late\nNight on out to sea to the south of New England just be
