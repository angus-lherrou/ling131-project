now it's actually interesting because I was a tomorrow I Begin my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\nAnd my Thirty years on radio that was one of the most thoughtful speeches I think I've ever heard and I'm frankly shocked I'm\nSusan Collins over the years is frustrated the living daylights out I mean we're putting in so I think what stands out more than anything else\nIs the the since here come the amount of gravity that she gave to her decision\nAnd her speech and the gravity of the moment and and as an bringing literally a sense of sanity\nTo what has become an absolute so she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from George cabin on his judicial temperament the questions that he's specifically answered her passion about\nUh especially didn't I disagree with her on on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice and consent\nAnd the respect that she is showing the constitution the process and the whole process of a role of what it means to give advice and consent\nNow with Susan Collins yes and Jeff Flake saying he is a yes on camera and all that now brings us to well Lisa Murkowski stimulate use ... know that brings us to fifty\nOr what forty nine fifty one forty nine yeah so that brings us to forty nine so really all comes down to\nSo I guess at this point Joe mansion and\nLisa Murkowski and Lisa Murkowski appears to be a no and I guess mansion could be the yes\nIs our math right on this who else is outstanding at this point because everybody else I think is on record\nNo\nNo I've got to believe I think Joe Manchin by the way I don't think it'll be a surprise he voted just two\nTwo and a to start the debate the thirty hours final vote a that'll happen mansion\nWell here we go we just broke mentioned is voting yesterday confirmed judge capital the votes of their pores the Danes as that is supposed to walk his daughter down the aisle tomorrow in the middle of this vote\nI don't know how they're going to work that out somebody better lend them up a private plane has some kind of get them over there [noise]\nUm what I did mired I think the most about this beach\nIs the pressure under which Susan Collins has been there is\nLiterally in Maine going on now in by the way Maine is not exactly one of the most expensive media markets but she talked in the beginning\nAt length about the process and what this has now become a and talk about being a a gutter political campaign\nAnd millions of dollars in people and groups of people pledging to destroy her and defeat or an upcoming elections et cetera and hum wow this is pretty amazing\nNo no I think everyone everyone labored with everybody and we all do since I was more now and everything can not only are in fact you're out in the air Murkowski voting no in fact your decision on creating my and I'm Glad I\nMiss out calcium but very very very very dear friend of mine very very dear friend of mine and I she did everything he crossed everything ... died she went through the same process we all did she come to a different conclusion I came to my ... and really this morning when I went to another hour and a half\n... do you believe the allegations he believed that before I die I Believe Dr Ford something\nI don't believe facts show that it was a cat and all but I Believe something happened\nTo someone else it and I think something happened to her I just thought it was no way no way all the ... what do you have to women who watched this process unfold her doctor for a story\nLike having a anyway even though they and they had people come forward I mean just that they're seeing her trauma they want\nAnd I mean my sympathy and they are her and I said hey you\nKnow adequate FBI investigation into happening in our house in four or five years from now don't be so much for the\nFor the FBI and that was that you enjoy it I think there's always room done I guess I looked at me and I make\nA decision based on what you see that at a photo investigation but it was from I live in a lot of people that I was concerned about how they said what they say how they did all the men are still in place for you after this you know I'm just the west for hours to go\nWith what you're up for reelection a difficult race are you concerned the baby\nOut and look at this one\nI have a minute on an above the Thursday you bother me\n[noise]\nAll right that is the ah [noise]\nWell that's the party of Nancy Pelosi offend thirty two day she's the speaker of the house screaming in the background and all the protesting that we have seen in the party of Chuck Schumer and and now we know party\nThat is willing to put all due process aside fundamental core values constitutional protections like the presumption of innocence aside\nThat will go along with the guilt by accusation I think one of the more articulate moments was in the beginning of of senator Collins speech today and how she rightly pointed out\nThere was opposition from day one Chuck Schumer was one of them there was nobody that President Trump that was that was going to be nominated that was ever going to pass that they get many Democrats from the get go and I do believe that that\nJoe Manchin probably a shortage reelection with this decision today but I don't really ... I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what are you saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today uh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons\nWell as articulated by senator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd now she's systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers\nUm what it means to the whole issue of the\nProcess of of a presumption\nOf innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade in precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett\nFox News legal analyst author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant uh with with uncommon eloquence and shown reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Collins can damn outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nAh was ... many of Kavanaugh's opinion\nAnd just to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations and set in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers no into civil cases is called preponderance of the evidence\nOr and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including her closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present have\nThat was probably the most impressive by main her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness which I've said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserved a serious response from the Republicans and\nI'm often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that senator Collins each brought some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know the student to Senator Bill calling from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... he thinks and that same vein\nYou're absolutely right what she said was a critically important\nAgain it emphasized the language of article ... section to a presidential have the power\nWith the advice and content that's what's been lost and all of this also critically important that you emphasize the presumption of innocence you have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this debate all of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based\nConcept in American law that kind of fundamental at rock American principle that's the way we go about our business we\nDon't assume based on allegation and a man or woman has built up a career is guilty was important for that um I worry still I have to say about where we go from here because we have seen behavior by United States senators and has been beyond the pale that I never in my wildest perhaps naive\nDreams could've imagined with hospitable people who simply don't know anything about\nProfessor Ford or judge Kavanaugh carved out of the nation you were a bad guy if you didn't wear black\nTo Columbia Law school during the cabin or hearing that meant you might believe judge Kavanaugh this is beyond the pale future lawyers I'm worried about where we go from here in the last one I Want to make um this is\nThe very same people who are limb basking the president for daring to criticize crooked FBI agents who have been proven to be ... et cetera\nThose people for whom struck was a hero or now criticizing the FBI if this wasn't a fairer thorough investigation they moved the ball or with their criticism whatever it is for judge Kavanaugh was he was a sex offender now is not that they don't like it at the meter because it took it personally when\nThey don't know they don't like is temperament I was once opposed to respond to be a serial drug or ... and gay rapist of teenage girls I I don't know what the appropriate response except if you're innocent just outrage and anger at a level that I couldn't even begin to describe but uh it\nLooks like this goes forward it looks like Kavanaugh has the votes that will support his nomination and that this will conclude tomorrow barring any unforeseen\nLast minute you know insanity but I Will tell you we one issue we've got to deal with and I'm I'm I got to say goodbye to both of you thank you both for weighing in on this Lindsey Graham is coming up\nDoes not have there is not a monolithic one voice radicalism that has taken over the Democratic party and the ... in the Republican Party I mean it was what's been fascinating\nTo watch with all of the madness the blood joining the character assassination the smearing lying the intensity the protests and it's not going to stop this is going to go forward\nIt's gotta stop if wherever we want to be the United states of America\nI mean how is it the Republicans always support Ruth Bader Ginsburg gun and Justice Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nAnd Republican nominees get just get legit\nBut does it matter if there's any corroborating evidence\nYou know one thing is I'm watching Susan Collins a speech was so well thought out based on facts\nAnd the standards that she uses to evaluate important issues maybe that's why she kept a tour so pretty much the whole time nobody knew what she was going to do\nThat was just not a a non partisan speech it was a speech\nIn a row of mind or of the dignity that we can have them in spite of big disagreements\nAnd talked about the law the constitution the role of the Senate advice and consent and a little bit of a class and she made all of these left wing or is that have been saying all these days and it's going to get worse\nUnless we insist that stop and thirty two days Lindsey Graham is next\n[noise]\n\n[noise] I'm decided\nFrom the KFYI newsroom ... Dale to more senators announce held they'll vote\nOn the Supreme Court nominee and that's likely ceiling his confirmation\nMaine Republican Susan Collins will vote yes on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination she says after reviewing his judicial record and allegations of sexual assault she is guided by a presumption of innocence\nThere for I Do not believe that these charging ten fairly per bad\nJudge Kavanaugh from serving on the court\nCalling so she believes Christine Blasey Ford was assaulted but says the accusation against Kavanaugh blacks any corroborating accounts from people named as president at the time and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has announced he is a yes vote those two yes votes makes Kavanaugh's confirmation\nLikely tomorrow on Capitol Hill German helper

peace has it since you what if needed or bright\nYet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the one\nWho drove her home or where in the car with her that night and professor Ford also indicated that even though he left that small gathering of six or so people up rapidly\nAnd without saying goodbye and to try none of them called or the next day or ever to ask why she left is she okay not even her closest friend ... ...\nMy fervent tall is that Brett Kavanaugh will work\n... less than the ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five or ... says and and so that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest\nCourt is restart\nMr President\nI Will vote chicken for judge cabinet\nAnd with that Susan Collins announcing I think one of the\nWell I'm going to be honest I thought it was the most powerful speech\nIn recent memory on the Senate floor that I've ever seen it was Thoreau it was so were it was smart it was bought full it was comprehensive\nShe went through everything from judicial temperament and philosophy to her own belief system how she came to her decisions are constitutional view on the Supreme Court\nOn the role of advice and consent on the madness and the circus that has broken out in this country\nAnd um I I have I I'm frankly we never run an entire commercial free our unless it's really important news and we did that where you are but loved audience because it was something that I wanted everybody to here\nThis is a moment in history what has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country\nYou cannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence weighed judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhen I really realized today is I don't know her well she doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody I've interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this\nIs the seriousness the intellect the the systematic\nShe walked every American through hard decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was obvious\nShe missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this process\nDid all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged ... they've been I don't even think it's safe to walk the\nSenate ... at this point Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him and he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and you'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a\nTesting and Maine is not exactly an a an expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and influence or in groups are pledging now to to vote her out of office and destroy her and I'm like did anybody listen to what\nSenator call just said that anybody want to listen I don't think anybody wanted to hear what she said because it was the single most thorough\nCase for for\nHow any senator or congressman should make a decision\nAgain a good example for a civics class to look at it in terms of the way a senator should act but let's talk about the politics for a moment [noise] okay I talk a lot about ... only because I've tried to save the system\nTo be on those votes but I mean I Know but but it no you more up for it\n... I don't think I had anything to make up for I really ... for you to disagree with me I'm not going to run my life around being somebody\nThere for I'm not going to end my life around what the hell Hannity things no way to\nBe honest with you I'm going to be true to me aren't you true to you\nYesterday on Leno wouldn't expect anything about\nSusan Collins she's a moderate\nPro choice Republican from New England that represents a party\nA that used to exist in New England in greater numbers she is a\nFiscal conservative she voted for the tax bill she's a social moderate\nAnd she will do things you won't like in the future but whatever she does will be thought out and reasons\nBut here's why I appreciate you talking about Susan Collins today she has come as close to anybody in my lifetime of saving the republic from the abyss because we're headed down where nobody would want to be a judge in the future if Susan had legitimize this God help the Senate confirmation\nPrior to ... ... she's she said it it's been a rapid decline for Thirty years they've tried it but I've got a new senator\nUm okay I don't think this would happen I don't think I Do agree with\nThat but I I'm going to do something without ... just just for a second okay I'm going to send me on area and the politicians do probably\nUh I'm fine uh you know I'm fine uh if you can help Susan help says they're going to try to destroy her now she comes from a purple state\nA President Trump last name a few points he wanted a second congressional district but Maine politics are different than they are in South Carolina and she was not about main herself she was about America\nShe represents the best of Margaret Chase Smith I'm a history of of Maine and if you really don't be fooled she's a moderate

come from\nAnd when we went through a lot of that success earlier in the program and a lot of it bears repeating by the way I mean these are ... for a million jobs created since the election more Americans now employed\nThan ever recorded in our history unemployment the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine\nFour hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama said never coming back by the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy sector once they can get up and on line and Anwar and and continue coal mining the president's saving the coal

surging lately ah where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's ... percent of the Trump voters I'm sure you know you've done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday a those voters were staying home or a good portion them a good portion of them weren't engaged and I think\nThey act it's got to see the the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at the map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours\nEntering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet or that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president's stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it and they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls\nThat Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for a super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day\nIt's it's not a big explosion but what it is is ...\nComing back in and get a well heeled well ... ... that Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago but less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process\nA party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence or the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and the fans Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWas shot I mean I don't quite know how to reply but I'll give you ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have\nIs an ongoing leaving the house which right there you can lead to pick up the house than I think from what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after cabin on it is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you\nAre talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her I think of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think that's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as the today probably some evidence that that\nIs going to have it inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and sit at home and use it for more than disgusting and somebody Who Lied to us ... marijuana Garland and things like that do you what they did to this man and how\nThey bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they ban with no due process\nAnd for once you know how critical I Am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserves they handled properly they looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou proud of the how the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll\nGive me a chance to do that I had a I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences with a judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and the Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of our judiciary destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nListen Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and\nThere's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party [noise] um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoug does makes the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Derrick has put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving\nBut they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape about women are people people weren't right door to realize it was a choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and they voted for Donald Trump\nAnd and this voters in the heartland right now that are engaged we have to keep them engaged over the next four weeks because when we when again and cabinet gets confirmed they can think oh things are fine now\nI Believe that he says by fire ... tall and that this trauma has ended hers lack\nCollins added she does not believe there was enough evidence to keep cabinet off the court said it is set to hold a final confirmation vote on Saturday\nA Chicago police
