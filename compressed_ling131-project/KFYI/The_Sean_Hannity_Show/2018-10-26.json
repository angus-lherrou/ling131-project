odds because it flows he takes over the house you know she's going to have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know she'll hunted killed jobs she'll put back and regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach president so\nYou've really got just over a week to try to stop pull a few of the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focused on that and run are very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story of today Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have to rational race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in Virginia ten were Barbara concepts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point it had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in the center of town I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLittle like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats below sea become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nA split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change\nI think of I think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll go check his taxes the link all this stuff and\nIt'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters\nWe get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys in for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty feet I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time projecting\nA very interesting are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the on the house the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and you\nKnow mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with the dirty secret it's not so much Donald Trump that is a risk the Republicans in the house and Senate was much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt the ... one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people in a lot of these races negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really dug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and had to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety\nFour and September that had we had the generic Republicans up seven and that was to house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour borrowed ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some save the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh\nDemocrats their National Committee two to one of the ... that money needs to find its way into the into\nThese top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats\nAre an spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop polo see we've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats\nAnd uh uh ... they've really they really are focused on trying to take over the ...\nI guess I'm not supposed to talk about the John\nOr you know and but you don't want to let some people are hoping that\nAfter this election it all goes away it's not going to go away what this is about is Donald Trump is a historic president and the region and he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so what's gonna happen is the presidential race is going to start right after the election on November ... where the Democrats are going to put up a big field of people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi as speaker\nIt's all about feeding Donald Trump's so this race November six is not just about control the Congress it's really about\nThe what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three million Trump voters that are out there need to get motivated to vote on November section fat\nThey should go to your website for Hannity dot com she's a top thirty most important races in the house and go and click through in click through to donate to the Republicans to match whatever the Democrats are doing to try to take control because yes race November ... is really about the next presidential race\nAll right thank you Doug Jones thank you John McLaughlin eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThat little charges

how bad upstate New York has become\nUnder Cuomo and you know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up fracking before the last election he just lied to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exists in their state and we can

calling\nThing that they they basically ... every time you disagree with one of them you you end up car races or not for your arm and this is what are we at least I Believe the two people who are\nA bit off maybe they're ... or something but when they hear the left wing calling us Nazis and calling us races and ... and and having people like Diane Watson and others\nPublicly saying that we should

again such a fantastic congressman for his own people used to watch out for them I got I have a couple of disagreements with him but the fact is I Know is\nEnergetic and will step forward and he will

then had shrapnel in it like a lot of charging a glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out
