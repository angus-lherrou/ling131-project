{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Goes on to other rights before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency we were talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like\nCan we stay here forever so it really means something to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading\nThese ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get creative\nSeveral of them smuggled the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I Would talk to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's earn in the hotel bathroom\nInto a pill bottle that she could then smuggle past parked security while others will simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a purse or an ... that that's gotten through security\nAs well and then once they're inside if they want to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the riots particularly dark so no one sees them other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of that\nPark but it doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around now I did speak with one woman who's in the story who in two thousand nine for the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella Castle\nAnd ran across the grass flinging them and she ran wild and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have photos of the sit there and I just saw the\nYou know so so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn ashes doesn't get noticed I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this and never get caught but you're right that in talking to custodians the consensus that I arrived at what did it happen about once a month\nBut I've heard stories of it happening more frequently I've heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I I think the park has says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney\nSo probably we point of pride that you know at this point\nWe'll put you on today by the way David Limbaugh's here with us You're gonna love this pastor I Will say this pastor because you've been very good to me and you even said to me he prayed for me\nAnd I I I Am I'm very touch when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen poll in the early church\nAnd David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nUh and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us and ah and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense to you know are often times phases contagious yeah and the face of one can rub off one another phase breathe\nYou guys getting in my grilled Telhami Hannity you know you need to shape up the ship out or Hannity going straight to hell live I can read your mind do I would never saw the way David ... book is now a two week some running on the New York times bestseller list welcome to you too David said a pastor Scott and green\nThank you hey how are you guys thanks for having me on what\nDay let's start with this mob everywhere we see we're not going to kick our I Would I ran into um\nWhat's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said senator Sean Hannity how are you\nWe had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out at the ballot box I have\nHave a fear and when I was the fear with him we got him myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response would go viral [laughter]\n\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself how would I have always situations and other man of the ... that's why I say I'm a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the only would come out with my wife told me would come out and then it would go by what my response would go viral but I think they pick and choose their targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to top crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice\nWe ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed look at you really gotta be careful in but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter and and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know why are we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nThink the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly decided to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestra now some people are going to vote the party regard list but others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior of the president during the campaign but you\nSay they have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating you're out of\nCleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back\nWell the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nPositive message nationalize that these last two\nWeek how how great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country\nHas a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they can afford to vacations take their kids to do is anyone there seven and be miserable but but they want to take their kids go out to eat not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that this is universal listed humanity\nYes it is I really believe these next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against these cell prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation I'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that\nA lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year at the same concerns that the Republican Party a shift\nRight good to see a both curry and we got to let you go to thank you so much for

make it to to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who is the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things er during the course the big thing they're doing which are not just doing it to be you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim ... gates whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan and keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now

be ripped apart if you don't think it's illegal you're not going to say I think it is illegal and roll\nAnd the thousands of American businesses will lose hardworking employees\nAnd the argument them as the president is Americans don't want to do the work wage jobs can't buy American workers to do the work was the president that is a crop in many instances it's just not true\nIn my view from the

presumption of innocence meanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and they're silent on Claire McCaskill's a husband between all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the mob that were out all all over the place this weekend\nAnd the success and failure Obama's failure Trump's success I think that there's a lot to get people to get out and vote we'll

that you know at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing\nTowards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can't have what you know you can't have seven thousand people just drop on our door\nAnd say take us in or were horrible people uh especially when the

Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump has called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like to weigh judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump\nTwitter insect light and they're all going towards the late in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American than you or me\nInto the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next day shaker it okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you know\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nOh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening up into the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen\nWithout the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these fronts in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut it's but ... but she was the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's not just all it is the chief cheese recognizing with the legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that quarter\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so they don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of ...\nShe does it go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response oh you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in laws I don't understand why just enforcing those laws I've everybody saw such a ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by\nEvery single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more job out of\nThe bottom ... percent of the society showing the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was gay he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not their jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean Sean list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually carry won a family in thirty forty or friends of the cage and I wanted to relate that story in an auto it quickly\nFred Trump showing up to collect rent with his twenty six year old son Donald J Trump in and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent the father has lost the job he's a blue collar worker Fred in his son are looking at him saying okay no problem\nAre very on guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a sixty short days

the spring\nMy mind to make Sally and I approve this message\nI have a big race going on in the great state of Arizona Fifteen days from now glad you're with us twenty five to the top of the hour a that was an ad put out by Martha mix Sally a war hero and her background or experiences pretty unbelievable here also watching an Arizona this caravan\nAre headed right towards our southern border it's become well a big big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back I'm\nKristin ... calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake yeah that blind shake involved in the ... the what the bombings in America\nUm she's had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha mix Sally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay at home moms for ... off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home leech off their husbands or boyfriends and just catching the checks of some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one I had you up by seven want to do it by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christ and send them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nThan well ... it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and your extreme as on so many issues as being on earth but the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and\nSo the only way that filters down his shows like yours are are turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona value than American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that we'd have a Senate committee disqualifying in the past\nAnd here we are right down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages\nOh about her radical out of step past this qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five\nCombat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was absolutely honored my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse and send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the ... nearly died\nA Sean when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans sense then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include your truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a command or\nAre we you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but oftentimes ah you know the ... the the firefighters happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's okay within American going to join the Taliban to fight against us\nI mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans parish over this\nAll the doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen right ... no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now a tree that thing conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that and and towards something that gets more choice for people more flexibility at the state level of them are free market get the federal government you know to not be doing it in one size fits all top down penalty taxes mandate it's\nSo we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote I voted to protect people with preexisting condition oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate that'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier\nGoing up against the very radical leftists in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much more than ... for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks on if you sign up flashlight on that in an advocacy and if people want to how they can go to Nick Sally for Senate dot com they need your support and how and donations weaken my next thing and some I\nThink you rod as in Florida\nCrushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you rod\nYes CERN legislation on this show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the president at actually a presented when he was on trial is okay\nAnd the reason why my concern is is because magic closed is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done a continuously they want us out of transparency and so we've given transparent like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever President Trump actually nominates they've already got a team investigating that specific person the attack on a smear campaign\nWell that's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that one on one one or two one oh three one oh five one oh nine that this is it you know and you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats now are trying to urge caution on blue wave and temper expectations\nThey're scared to death because after all the mobs and after what they did with Kavanaugh and what we see with the caravan and we see the ... now that that it is getting into focus what eight years of Obama was like versus two years of Trump\nThe
