Seventy eight hundred dollars monthly safely invest in a real estate ... Hi I'm Tony Martinez co founder of the Phoenix and I are\nAnd the F. word all these things are shouted against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop the let them clamor board to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have\nTens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico GM other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled they have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers do enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who dropping her jet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here legally\nYou're going to take and right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so\nUh I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information\nThe damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminal societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest there's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California\nTaxes through New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist\nThe murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy\nRight now with Trump is our leader\nEverything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new trading necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip as an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head\nThe terrorists are on the run ISIS is destroyed\nIran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe\nBecause according to CNN this is the issue of unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way\nThrough the magic wand\nThat we get to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through presidencies we take in legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million but I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen this has fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse if in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go ... or the bridges and roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that the most violent places on earth\nIs sending us largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education\nDoes it benefit the hospital systems that we have\nThis benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join a country come in walk into a country which you don't belong to a not a citizen of men demand rights are you kidding me\nOh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks in two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that\nOne eight six six six or seven seven three three seven we continue we have calls from a Chicago Los Vegas Connecticut California San Diego and every place in between coming up later will be Corey Lewandowski\nWho was the Trump campaign manager for a year and a half and twenty six team did a great job I'm going to have ... plus Kevin Jackson twenty

than a truck drivers lie for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses lie for coal miners life a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured\nHappens all the time in American elsewhere so why is the death of a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news\nBecause the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there's those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia they don't like that\nAnd I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist some alley indirectly cause the death of Jamal could show gay in Turkey who held believes this crap\nIt's unbelievable but let's continue\nBlonde becomes available which never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing\nIs tonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivize rather mainstream media and the fact that Jamal can show gate if he was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage at is deaths that was ... it should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind ... give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't because the media doesn't cover it you mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us than a brave police officer who gave his life is that what\nCNN believes the answer is yes they want to use ... as a cudgel against Trump and why I have no idea they must have nothing else to talk about [noise]\nMost concern [noise] we

well please go ahead\nWell here's the thing it Connecticut your woman require ... hearing granted I\nKnow for a fact he's working on this caravan with a lot of other Democrats across the country and he's probably going to be down at the border in a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand of the poor\nYou know by the time to spring hits the fan President Trump has already said he's not use of the reserves you use a real army and I think the plan is they want this real like another ... current state kinds of ours and we go to our troops on the border\nThe immigrants are being ... don't worry store of it like stormed the Mexican border a few days ago Mexico over ... put it in a token effort to hold them back twenty four hours or the ... the U.S and see a deal with Mexico because Trump has got a very good Mexico I read all these people on our border\nThe troops are going to be there they got to be colder stormed the troops\nI think there's got to be a lot of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there oh ... ... for the media the media we're just as well coordinated\nLet me ask you this white ... you're from a Dick Blumenthal he used a war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty\nI does this play well with residents to Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is playing horribly for Trump\nWhere I live in Ohio we don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals coming from the most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant there's tens of thousands of them here thanks to Governor Malloy ... with my dog past year and a half\nThe Blumenthal every time these legal immigrants ISIS above the court room they hold up Richard\nBlumenthal shows up at the church or other

violent places on earth Central American we're not scaled or doing\nContinuing ed and know Los Vegas Nevada and ... and welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI and the U.S national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current uh current boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also how can a bomb a drone American citizens like this hour we eat guy kill 'em all up you know trial no ...\nNo execution and then the media doesn't saying you know at the beginning of march later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and it's because you know ... ... ... in in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club or against Trump they'll do it\nBut ... out of whack he's being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by that a legal immigrant\nOr not was quickly dropped she's gone a cubs that are killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact that ... that kind of behavior not part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalist\nAnd then I hear about the show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why his life more valuable than a cubs life\nMPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayers is the same I end up look at the head of the past set of who's backed us they understood oil as political off on July ... portion Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we need it the base their supply Afghanistan\nPlus ... says African Business conference that Obama held\nWere fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ...\nGallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR they just fall over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background\nOf the stuff's bought fortress African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr not and and you want to quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil alive his political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replacing floating around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right there boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama\nBy privacy mall all of them probably forty million right\nThat would come [noise] but you know it's it's funny because there's also a lot of there's a lot of a love for American hunter stores like Congress or as you'll see the American flag you'll sit on the wall she lays there is so they're in fact I was even that does is getting off the site or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to ... the first date of\nYou know like oh my God [laughter]\nThe reason why is because people if we if we can come and run their country and give it a local government\nIt would people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic\nAnd you didn't have a gym thank you but here's some fact throwing the violent death rate in Honduras was Ninety five per one hundred thousand nine of the ten most violent countries on earth or south the U.S border sixteen the twenty most violent or sell U.S born on the other four are small countries in Africa\nSo we're we're taking in large numbers of immigrants from those violent places on earth none of them are

gonna call Peter Wallison he's written a book about the bureaucracy the so called deep state how\nThat continues it continues today three thousand new rules and regulations a year hundreds every month it never stops is going on right now Trump's trying to stop it he's going to make that he made the point in his book that I read\nThat that it cannot be stopped that there's a deep state in Washington that will continue even assuming Trump is there for eight years it will not be stopped that's his point he might I Would agree with\nI Would agree with that completely and I I Want to tell you you know the ... the clip protested against a governor governor I mean judge Kavanaugh right they were led by the Democratic party for a specific reason they don't want constitutional judges on the Supreme\nCourt oh no they\n... they they kinda want a super legislature they they won judges to impose rules and regulations on us that cannot be passed to the Democratic process\nAnd so they've done that the last thirty or forty years and when you got course itching Kevin all who ... oh I Hope become constitutional judges they're going to say wait a minute if you want to convince your fellow citizens stamp abortion or gay marriage or something else\nGo convince them in the legislature passed a law it's OK don't come to us to service the second legislature and I hope that took Kevin O's Gorsuch and Roberts and Alito and and not Thomas I I Hope that's what\nThat's what they do in the future is don't come to us to impose new rules on the American people go to the legislature go to the Congress go to the states go to the city is going to the county that's where it belongs\n[laughter] you know the Democratic party bill ... ... ... in a ... a sure experiment and he did it over here is my state of California yeah how's it going how's Venezuela looking\nOh my God yeah you know it it yeah almost the same [laughter] but we have a a man who will probably be governor and lieutenant

now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats\nOver the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the

did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's gonna send supposedly\nA our soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during the election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaign or buy a Tom's dire and by Bloomberg and others\nIn order to uh to me are Republicans all over the country get get get me over the next two weeks you how's this going to play out I'd like to early on November the sex\nBut Democrats have missed every find they no longer have their finger on the poll from the American electorate\nPeople want our border protected so they and they also get that this is fake news it's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand now and so\nWhat prompted the right thing he said Honduras these people show up you're losing their aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the new president of Mexico and say look\nIf these people get three you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we're going to look at the age that we're able to send you\nTo Mexico the polling military on the southern border got just heard this literally today good so Mexico's going at it on doors I bet you will send buses the say ... you're going to get back to our country or else\nAnd and the what the how they're going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand they think that there's some issue that's going to be the ... the you know the ... the division point with Americans in Americans overwhelmingly won our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horns to think that they can just come anytime they want\nSo whether whether it's the ...\nOr whether it's the Kavanaugh fact whether it's the stars of an

different than what the founding fathers intended what the constitution did not intend\nThe consequences had been not necessary rules and regulations and it costs the American economy billions of dollars every year\nThe constitutional separation of powers been compromised in other words\nThe ... the the agencies in the federal government or the state government agencies were mainly the federal

for twelve years Brett Kavanaugh often knocked down the administrative state room by rule which is a great thing now described as the American people what is the administrator state and how does an impact our lives\nAre the administer the aid is all of the uh federal agencies including everything from the Treasury Department\nAll the way down to the FCC and there are a hundred of them and a way that they impact our lives is that they make a lot of rules and regulations based on staff who\nIn many cases a generations old [noise] and those rules and regulations are not only plentiful that is there are many of them but they have a major effect on our lives and the purpose of the book that I have written is to explain\nThat we have to rain banned in in some way\nWho's ... when the when you when you say we have to arrange them in who is we\n[noise] ah well the American people have to train them in and the way to do it is so unfortunately the only way we do it is through uh the court system and that's why your point about a ... a Brett Kavanaugh having been\nA confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the fifth road of the five of the five member majority who would be interested in raining in\nThe administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day there must be complied with how\nMuch farmers are causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of harm in the sense of what business is of course it it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very extensive for businesses one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor and in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually ... ah either from businesses or from individuals each year\nThey very significant thing but it can be turned back town they can be reduced give me hold on\nIf the idea here and described in the book is that the courts can step in\nAnd began to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nA rules are based on laws that were passed years ago sometimes generations ago and they are in ... by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority that make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called judicial court or do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency and we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "22"}
