Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA\nWhich have led to mass of levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled the black families by and bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married it goes on and on and on and this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr you sell the racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWhen CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves the Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan\nAs a terrorist arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities\nOf the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow why Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats because his sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control\nWeight while I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media in Democratic Party and so\nThen I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West\nIs the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jessie Molly Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat is why CNN working with the Democratic party must destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore\nChicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional that black family is completely broken there's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years\nWith no discernible results yet when a black man like Kanye West step settle on\nHim against their expressed support for a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking in acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm\nCan you think of worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nWhen you think about how badly the Democratic party is treated blocks the relevant question isn't y con you realize that but why others have not realized why even more black voters had the same ... funny as Kanye West why has it had happened yet well maybe it is 'cause right now\nThe mountains\nRight now is\nThis the media uses cut jewels in weapons\nTo hit politically Trump every chance they get and once they wear out that person you don't hear from 'em anymore right now it is ... shows you a good show ... who's the Saudi Arabians citizen\nWho was in Turkey in order to get like a permission to marry some uh some Turkish woman he goes to the Saudi Arabian embassy in could show geek has not been seen since October the second now this happen in Turkey is Danville turkey it appears probable\nA Saudi Arabian citizen was killed\nIn Istanbul, Turkey somehow Trump was responsible for this they want the president to respond to the media use Julie sweating it for awhile dispose of her when the uh allegations of gang rape and Michael ... whose father with Michael ... is doing a great job speaking for the Democratic party\nIt'd be wonderful that guy would stay in the media for the next couple of years\nIt'd be great if he was the nominee of the Democratic party the porn lawyer fits the modern Democratic Party that guy's done a great job you take Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or Christine forward haven't heard from them in a while I have you because the media is done using them to attack Trump or Stormy Daniels what's the last time you heard from her\nOr Karen McDougal in love with the president for ten years ago\nAccess Hollywood tape of Billy Bush the comments on John McCain the Khan family Kanye West Jim Brown whatever it is right now it's all about Jamal could show ... somehow media want you to think the president's not responding correctly so the murder maybe I'm a Saudi Arabian and assemble\nIt as if to six or seven hundred blacks killed in Chicago every year can't be used at all by the mainstream media against Trump's they ignored or the four thousand shot they can't be used\nIn Chicago to attack the president said they ignore it whenever the media can find some ... some club to hit the president whether they're going to do it\nLet's continue with more coming up next to this is my interview with the president then at the top of the last to our Web Bill O'Reilly they rally factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so

human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and an South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused\nSo we call it the U.S embassy a and

two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where\nSo many jobs and talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico are we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nBut we had it in ...

Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage\nOf Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I I don't recall with all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped in the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but it can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction we're going to start covering the news objectively we're gonna have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by ... a Republican governors\nHouse the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing conservative what CBS would say from top to bottom or going to resolve well we're going to reflect conservative values\nAnd cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News ABC NBC and CNN would take one alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often were Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conduct it was a regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for

it\nAnd sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen sending us to talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was it to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one twenty billion\nAnd we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure it was very happy right now about\nYour wife is going to ... to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nShe's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself\nFor a couple of years we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh\nAnd the poverty is incredible no the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do not cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nThe kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just extra car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out [noise]\nI don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused\nSo we called the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal I made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nHow many jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico will be talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent ... people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least it's fair in our\nFarmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country to the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even on elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay if we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city":
