Ford Excursion limit went through a stop sign and hit a parked SUV at the apple barrel country store in school here in New York west of Albany Fox's Brian Younis the store\nWho tried tried to rape her not one but for boy she said she said she was in her late teens\nAnd she switched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the Nineteen eighties then she switched back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault\nBut part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got a proven supposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes then we find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica\nShe went to Hawaii she went to ah the south Pacific Island she went to a French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes\nThe boring front also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned a sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh she had no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nBut she uh the the second door theory was a bunch of crap\nBecause he came out that they want it to second door in their home in twenty oh eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that she also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today\nHer lawyer Deborah cats came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really she's done with it\nSo\nTurned out to be liars and thieves in trucks and miscreants every every description the second accuser Debbie ...\nA dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one's supported her story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez shaking his junk and her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Lebanon Eddie boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous\nAntithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from a weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweat Nick nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular\nOf the allegations raised by professor forward\nBut at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham\nAnd I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it plus uh as far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a experts and independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a ... this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin Oh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rapist to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory counts\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent a combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied or how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice\nBut justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward\nThey completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation and so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist because in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and show you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show as a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this one of the Drudge Report this evening aerial do miss aerial doom is as a writer\nOn Stephen coal bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nUnquote you see this was never about\nFinding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak by a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that she wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable\n... and this writer for the CBS Evening show\nSteven ... says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life they want it to ruin ... for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump\nWho they hate that sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority\nAnd now we're more energized vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is a hero Mitch McConnell is a hero unbelievable the losers the mainstream media peddling analyzing irrelevant sees Senate Democrats demon crashes demon rats and some of them call them the Senate demon rats\nAnd Michael ... who's a loser in a sense but I Want that got to continue appearing with Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon every night you can put 'em on keep doing he's doing a great job\nSo let's continue with more of your calls at eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up later is that same Julie gun lock the independent women's forum talking from a woman's mothers perspective\nThen the vicious lies perpetrated a bone in by the Senate mother major media I got on his side completely one hundred percent and the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball any more north teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborated information in fact it was shown to be false\nIt's because the allegations the title nine proceedings but that were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the facts you put a second front door and her house including the fact that\nUh there were four witnesses that were corroborate her story including our best girlfriend none of them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out\nIn an affidavit to the Senate how many times that professor Ford lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the mainstream media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett a judge third power of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this edge adjust the judge hardness or wait for you\nAnd so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it\nBut she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping\nThe Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen is continuing their cause real cause from

of their ah okay well before I was putting out my fire I don't keep their showed a hunter so you're drowned the first started\nGrounded again and felt that it was cold uh-huh oh yeah he likes it when people correctly put out their campfires he's pretty big on well\nUp like a tenfold bake it in the night she was brilliant going over for forty five minutes while she was going to support then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins said to say\nIn maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees and the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of a Brett Kavanaugh's wife his mom and dad has girls and what they had to put up with a like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nUp some sexual assault the most likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my\nAnd Brian kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to but now clowns in fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett ... fame to run against or in Maine have added\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah\nDo you know the Democrats claim to care about women but uh over the years but one of the largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would split women that way\nAbout Mike eliminated the porn lawyer and I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times\nMichael ... is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty could we be that lucky\nMy having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they didn't have one criminal prosecution against pornography and that opened the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring a porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars that the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies and subjugated women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota\nAnd they're really cared about women and sexual assault\nBill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and joining sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because uh you know the older the fact of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UVA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges from false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time\nBut I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses\nTell me again about the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things\nLewis turn out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nBefore a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kavanaugh is because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties\nBrett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut\nSo she had to tell the fear that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapists clearly indicated it could not have been bred to Kevin ... you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth my right arm hurts when Israeli you're left foot because you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said in twenty twelve\nNow for boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for\nSuddenly it was in her late teens that was Fifteen\n\nViewer over the age of

are male what kind of feelings damp toward them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lies and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and one on a ... percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney\nTake off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar Raj or victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person but then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth are concerned and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process that determined to vote she was saying was accurate now here we are several days later after she testified what about ten days ago\nThat practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened but how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was the ... the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out and says she was a safe\nAnd some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and at one end not because she needed an extra way out but because\nA small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door and had nothing to do it costs are phobia\nThen the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying we flew little planes all over French Polynesia and to Haiti and uh Hawaii\nWe also went on trips to Central America South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie\nIn fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about finding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation\nThat could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into it\nAnd it is going to come to that and I I hate to be that I'm\nPessimistic about America right now\nBut the way this this mob rule mentality is leaving us down a path to what President Lincoln faced as soon as he took office in Nineteen sixty one and that is what I Am afraid of I'm not afraid of democratic control of the house with the Senate or the presidency\nI'm afraid of civil war and we're on that path and unless these people get checked somewhere and I'm not talking about suppression of vote so I'm not talking about\nThe limitations of their First Amendment rights I'm Talking about\nThem actually getting control without any facts\nTo subordinate their their case without anything else they will stop at nothing when Democrats and and we're aggressive loopholes in this day in twenty eight team cannot win at the ballot box that go to the court they can't one of the courts they go to the streets and the cat went in the streets the next thing has bloody revolution\nHere before we go to bed tonight part of the Drudge Report Michael good one who writes for a New York or newspapers has a great column about the coming second civil war read that we got to run take a look let's continue\nLet's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think\nWe need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller I think it was Brian from India that that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side how are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three\nI think there are people like Brian who saw\nOn only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get power\nNumber two that Democrats look socialist progress is hard incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change or whether it be utilized but that Dr forward presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable I Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about the second front door she lied about them for boys became one she lied about or late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about in fact it was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nThat's right and and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah hat's off to college hats off to Lindsey Graham about political forces the only way that we are going to come and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce winning forced by beating them at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday and that was correct you got to vote it down or if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly any where there's a sea of red from cedar shining see it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone and then major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Robert\n... and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... meets her maker you watch that fight\nReally didn't affect you today to hear Eric Holder who scale contempt of Congress said that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court let me see Billy the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court\nWe never questioned malignancy of the problem is but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimacy of a process do you recall outrageous\nYou recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media has a meltdown when Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results in November elections if he felt it was rigged against him in the media Hillary Clinton in New York Times jumped on top and Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a core Salinger was going to win\nAnd then Trump won and up to this point Hillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election\nBecause it looked like it it's rigged however the media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and that means he's talking down an American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a show in New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show in New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nI could Mr
