Fox News on Friday President Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a limited supplemental investigation into the sexual misconduct and assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh boxes chat program with what you expect\n... but Chris Wallace of Fox News didn't wanna wait\nHe said after she testified quote forge testimony is extremely emotional extremely raw and extremely credible no one could listen to her deliver those words and talk about the salt and the impact had her life and not having your heart going out to her this is a disaster for the Republicans\nAnd judge Nepal a ton of Fox News that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nNo she isn't it's proved ugly false what she said she is not credible because her therapist said it didn't happen that way and witnesses she identified as being present weren't witnesses at all how\nHow's it credible when ... when they testimony from others may get incredible let's continue\nTo go to Shane in Montana Sen in Montana welcome to the Cunningham show saying go ahead\n[laughter] either bill first of all thanks for taking my call I appreciate it I think you're a great conservative and elect so your ...\nYour new great jobs keep doing what you're doing thank you um and I bear with me for a minute 'cause I Want to kind of go through the ... we've seen over the last couple of years and certainly over the last week how I'd say agree just indispensable the Democratic side has certainly been throughout this whole process\nWe know that if Democrats are our control defended at this point in their old any controversy surrounding a nominee a nominee judge that they would nominate and there is any sort of Republican resistance they would absolutely just laugh in the play ... in the face and Virginia will be\nHammered their nomination through in ... no one would bat an eye on it and so I'm Wondering why you know with Senator Flake and the GOP why they're even\nLegitimate legitimizing these\nAre incredible aren't corroborated allegations that you're talking by\nTrying to you know do this FBI pro that they're going to be talking about over the course of the next couple of weeks because the whole point of an FBI probe the find the truth without looking at what is your conclusion or perceived conclusion right now and that's not what the Democrats want they don't want the truth they want to try and solve is out completely passionate Jordan so why did you pay even hesitating on its\nWay to go just to you know are there was full of those they're they're weaponized and Christine forward against the Republican Party and Jeff Flake too stupid to figure it out because some woman confronting them in an elevator\n[laughter] in\nFront of the same crew then went after Ted Cruz in the restaurant\n[noise] absolutely and that's why we even legitimize those outlawed in front of the people I think it's going to have you know\nAh I think if a deal the and I've read from\nYou know harsh I'd say not harsh but you're from conservative commentators who are very critical and certainly are two of the deal from this aspect this didn't hurt them in the Senate to don't just absolutely go through with their constituents want and not listen to all these falls pools or anything like that\nAnd just pushed out of an odd through and get it over with and move on because the longer they wait on this that you can allow for more time for just false allegations other people to come forward and legitimize even more preposterous allegations against the guy who I've talked to our senator\nOr I'm originally from South Dakota senator a few weeks ago and he said he Kavanaugh is this the absolute amazing man just\nA you know they just got to put them through and if they don't it could hurt him in the mid\nTerm chain it can Kavanaugh will do the job on the U.S Supreme Court absolutely\nHow does he represent a conservative philosophy that many of us have on and on the Supreme Court for decades\nAs he got an exemplary life as an adult at least for the past thirty five years he's like as you let an exemplary life\nAbsolutely he has\nNow Rangel Christine forward and being uncorroborated is not fair isn't it true that the allegations decreased Christine forward had been refuted by the therapist and by the witnesses\nAbsolutely I don't want involved as\nWell and her story whether it's the doors or or or him being on the list in December twenty sixteen when he was in her anti Trump activities politically the therapists notes all these things is that the so called Safeway\nAnd a mark judge thing doesn't hold up\nEvery time she says something and his approval believe false now it could be the mental disorders that she's suffering from which any of us could have\nShe says she's suffering from depression impede TST and is in therapy well that's fine but but it took a Thirty Years' for recovered therapy to indicate it was Brett Kavanaugh but she never told her therapist that was Brett Kavanaugh\nEven though she said she did because it's not in the notes so she lied about that isn't that important\nAbsolutely it's important and the longer we continued weapons throughout the Jewish people are going to go out it seems like they after day long ago I go out and just going to get worse and worse so they just need to push through and do what needs to be done\nAnd I'm waiting for Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday to see what else is in the Democratic a trick bag to pull out I Can't imagine maybe the Kennedy assassination maybe\nThat maybe some do Reagan shooting I don't know maybe that do come across scandal was spread cabin I may be UVA was Rolling Stone and the drunken parties in girls in bedrooms being ritual is simply raped by the Cavaliers or UVA I\nI don't know what's going to come out next but you keep waiting and waiting and think enough is enough this guy's qualified he can do the job it's been an older boy the last thirty five years of his life even if he drank a little bit of the Yale who doesn't who didn't I'm Talking about thirty five years\nOf brutal and I'm only twenty four and therefore I Do and Lindsey Graham he'd been set up this week I I'm trying not to be surprised at this point but it's it's pretty shocking grad cement fried ... they seem to elevate if you're a new level every time just one I think they can't get any lower do something more agree just they seem to top it and I was treated like a competition for this for him\nOr saying I fear they're winning it and if the Republicans cannot get him through within we're going to know I guess by next Sunday and many\nAh I imagine Thursday or friday run here from the FBI then is for days and it's for business days for the Senate to take it up\nSo might be Monday Tuesday Wednesday like eight nine days from now that guy belongs on the Supreme Court and the character assassination has got to stop and go to Mike in Virginia Mike in Virginia

I don't mean to interrupt but I Know what they were\nDoing only half way more I got this\nTime of it I Know we can lay out the case for hours look they were stolen for two weeks\nFor simple reason they had Meryl Streep give her acting lessons you know someone like Meryl Streep has been co chair and co chairing coach you're probably a team of five people coach here for two weeks to make sure that she was so monotone and so calm it's like that are on ... and they they act like a little girl I mean that that Senator Whitehouse\nI Swear to God I thought he was going to say do you like a lollipop ... little girl because she was so calm and he was being so nice store and here's the big problem the Republican Party is filled with ...\nAnd ... now there's a couple of New York where it's she walks in\nBuses who were scared to death their own shadow not one Republican mail center white male center was willing to interview a woman for the thought they'd be called sexist racist than thousand other words by liberals they gave it to a woman a woman prosecutor's Mitchell who is\nThe single worst prosecutor I haven't\nSeen in my tier like you and I could have put this girl on the stand and you and I would have destroyed our bill we would have had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case within ripped\nTo shreds about five minutes and she couldn't get a decent questionnaire and Ken around the five minute questioning\nShe couldn't get it out and you got to see using a true you fly all the time yes or no it isn't it true now you told his Jimmy you needed a two day break to be able to drive your\nHe isn't it true that you will not give us that there is no she gave the Washington Post isn't it true you blind yourself with a foreign ... most of your life isn't it true not one single witness ... boy you said\nIn the ... came from you isn't there you go and who\nIsn't it true that you said that in two thousand twelve you finally awakened and wits your psychiatrist because you were redoing your house and that renovation about security door\nIs what may bring back your memories of this attempted rape except there's a problem we checked your records and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar they could have said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to connect you with the top Democrat lawyers and George chores lawyers to get involved in this case\nThey could've after a thousand questions they could've after ... well they did after who paid for your lie detector tests and I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous\nThey could've after about a thousand issues like a two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named three potential people would be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve took out he had the newspapers all over the country that said roe versus\nWade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice and they replaced\nGinsburg faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney's Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by making up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your\nFather as CIA true your grandfather was CIA true your brother was working for a law firm that found a GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative we're all those questions\nHow bad is it true the bread Kevin O's mother Marilyn said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure of your parents who do you\nCall it kept me on that one because they claim he was never quite for closed down and they got the house back so what she was a young girl she was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned by a judge\nThat you get incredible power over the future of her family's life and even though of actually they take him to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the in kind of root for them\nIt doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is now going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand things you could say the CIA one it's amazing that's not a conspiracy theory or dad CIA at her grandfather CIA and her brother is with a company with a law firm founded fusion\nGPS on all things considered and other deep state fraud conspiracy there's no other way about it there's no coincidence any of this stuff but having said all that listen\nLet's forget all that for a minute forget it forget he gave the most\nBeautiful opening statement I've ever heard in my life I cried five times all my friends cry I've spoken to fifty or more women on my radio show my TV show and letters to me over the last three days all said they cry because they've got sons\nAnd they can't believe that there's some was crucified like this I Believe America's on Brecht capital inside and I believe any pull you see that says a says otherwise is another democratic ... job another lie another over sampling of Democrats\nI got a hundred letters today

Love you you're a great way and what you said about Brett Kavanaugh's fantastic and and I'm with you and five of them were liberals and all five of them in one way or another basically told me I Hope you get murdered or ... I Hope someone comes and murders you or one of them had a great line\nThey said I Hope there's a woman in your house and shrimp tonight the plunged into your head out and mentally disturbed or left is all they know how to do is talk about murdering people disagree with and then they call that's crazy I mean\nYou're just dealing with sick people who do anything and say anything because they believe\nA lot solid Lenski that the ends justify the means and that's why this Christine for came forward and that's why the woman at Yale came forward and that's why the sick go charge gang rape came forward and the next five women you hear about this week are all going to be liberal women wear pink vagina hats in March and anti Trump rallies\nWho think they're saving the world by coming forward in line it's as\nSimple as that this guy is innocent he's a boy scout is Jimmy Stewart is an easy Andy Griffith and made very are empty he's a fine man had what they did as a character assassination and they're sick people there's something wrong with all of them Democrats ... there's nothing else you could say\nWe are targeting number one white straight Republican men are the target of the Democratic party\nSaid well we're glad other provable fact in June of twenty sixteen Trump put on lose to twenty five judges that would be on his list\nFrom what you would pick one of those twenty five new Supreme Court you might recall June July August that was a big deal with twenty sixteen she said that that because I'm Kevin O's name was on the Trump blitz during the campaign but also triggered some thought she had to come forward and do whatever\nIn reality ... Kevin O's name did not hit the Trump bliss until November a twenty seven dean more than one year after the election his name was ... and the list to react to December twenty sixteen but the media done boy that out either\nYeah lives in the best case I think of all of those out of all I mean they're all happening but the best one\nIs that Dianne Feinstein knew about this in July\nIf this was real how can anyone think it's real when they interviewed him one on one face to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempted to rape or they have that for the last days to see first if they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary\nTo try and destroy and let's just go ahead and ... and and they're using the same deal a used against Clarence Thomas storm and things\nI think labor at the same playbook they use it against judge Roy Moore I mean I don't know anything about Roy Moore bill I really don't and I thought his answers were kind of strange and invasive and I wasn't quite sure whether I should support him\nBut in the end I came down and the idea that this was forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories which could be proved not much evidence and none of which had witnesses\nYou cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that and they decided that at work which judge Roy Moore let you do with with Brett Kavanaugh it's very clear that that's what this is if it was real fights that would've brought it up and one on one meetings with the man show can you imagine if I'm up for a major job and someone gets a letter that says oh Wayne route attempted to rape me\nThat's where the Google Facebook\nMore than TV in fact radio reaches twenty percent more millennials\nMore of the people you want to talk to all in one place when it gets I heart media dot com and get a M.

I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to get conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after a doctor forwarded testified the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForge testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about the assault on the impact it at our life and not have your heart go out to her this is a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge in Apollo ... generally I respect that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist said forward as a credible unbelievable\nSo one when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and the feeling is the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhat when you have ah Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who won the anonymity to testify\nTurned down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out her lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I tried to test her credibility making bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking so when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't and we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think we were paying to Colorado yeah completely lost our way because he went to one telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning or the people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and men I found Brett Kavanaugh ...\nThere was such a raw emotion from falsely accused innocent man\nWho in the in the court of public opinion and they aren't days leading up to this quote unquote hearing I his life was completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats and his career with looking to be entirely sabotage interest and destroyed\nAs well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nOr she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she sat herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to front door bell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had issues now just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or just because she sends Brett Kavanaugh outrage or maybe not but all the evidence that she for that so far fall short of being out of it ends\nIn fact if you presented us in a court of law in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation on line or a light all who said I don't even know where I live in all\nThe all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did in ... her best girlfriend\nSaid they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen but the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court what his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Rock Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know\nBecause I ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about equal rights and gender equality what are you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a man as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily call and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly and then we find out she was all over the world", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "01"}
