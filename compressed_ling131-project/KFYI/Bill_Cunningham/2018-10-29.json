Robert Bowers are Jewish\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers and if I was in charge I Would a\nWith all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for\nIn a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor my God and so I look about what happened in\nThe hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with\nWas he on friend that was ... who else knew what he was he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also headed Trump because Trump is the only American president in history\nThey're Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner\nIs a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish\nReligious functions is I have and so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post were not exploit to attack President Trump\nThe evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo or one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans\nSo that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they are not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received the photo bomb in the mail from the ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day and in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know was a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News\nHad a play in Central Park that stimulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor\nSee Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt to the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things\nAbout Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and he was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans\nPeople like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail envelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice and like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd a fat doesn't fit then they don't print it if there was a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence but win\nLargely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd some on the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite set a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with at the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight\nNot to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago and that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing\n[noise]\n... twenty seven is ... prescription drug take back to help

the American military stronger today than it was two years ago in fact everything it could go writes gone right\nAnd not much has gone wrong and that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not bizarre\nContinue recalls will go right to go to Robin Utah\nRobin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show rub go ahead\nHey thanks for taking my call Yes sir thank you\nWrite them well yesterday in the middle of the day after the shooting they had Al Sharpton on MSNBC he's rally against anti Semitism down and then today on a show there again really again and and the well\nIn friends [noise] and you know\nWell I'm not ready for how about the riot then Al Sharpton started a New York city\nHuh based upon the death of a Jewish person what about ... furniture Mart I mean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis ...\nThat's right and and get it [noise] I I watched it in correcting flee going really a year here I can\nMake yourself not so sure with these people get it done or evil\nYou know I just Google this December thirty Ninety Ninety five the river and Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion martyrs they're white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre\nNewly revealed taped show Sharpton designer named Freddy but manages the least dispute in ... his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton inside of the massacre at Fridays furniture Mart because a Jewish a\nBusiness owner moved into the black community\nAnd so I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on it I'm people fall for this crap\nAnd you know the other thing is that the guy who write to the White House for your time and it was right and he actually got the castor bean made rights and\nAnd and this is you're calling from Utah and this was the guy who's now when they're an indictment now this was in a large media stories that fair to say no the words maybe it\nWasn't even a large comedians story here in Utah and second page below the fold\nAnd and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of the story it All right but I don't know just being concoction would've actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb no other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get white powder over your hands impose on your lap believe me and it's a fearful tear filled event and this is a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nCover it and and you can make rice and I don't care if they're being real\nOh well can you imagine a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up but you can bring up anything you can say a word\nWell you know Time Warner did this to Trump well what if the parent company of Fox are sponsored a play in Central Park\nThat depicted the murder through repeated stepping up Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the ... number one Fox's parent company never do it\nBut Time Warner sponsored a play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar ... character looking like Trump being chopped the death toll on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night\nNow but I Wonder if the same thing that happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nWhat it would add a comedian who be headed rock Obama and held his head bloody head on stage\nBut Cathy Griffin now is touring the country to slow down audiences\nWhy explained to me Rob why the media doesn't respond to these obvious\nDiscrepancies in disparities between the way they treat different acts the same actors committed\nIt kinda depends against too much conducted thank you for your

of the earth Jews have done magnificently here because of family and faith and academics and hard work the Israeli ambassador to America said that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to be in anywhere in the world\nAnd so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter\nAnd no matter what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media depressed CNN and their allies always lecture Trump Republicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric and our violence but when progressive explode\nWhich happens on a regular basis like stabbing Republicans setting a trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins\nOr the children are the president whenever that goes on at no point or progressive ever lectured by the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism even when the\nPresident is the only one in American history to have Jewish grandchildren\nAnd even though the murder in Pittsburgh had postings saying how much he hated Trump because Trump a Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump\nNever mentioned in the hatred the radicalism of the left which exceeds what happens on the right the whole Ferguson and Baltimore\nThe race writes the shooting at cops in Dallas and Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left never any connections river me\nBetween the cop killers in Dallas during a rally a black lives matter and then meeting and the White House with those same leadership a black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama\nAnd the media never said wait a minute Mr Mr President how do you mean with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops what are we went dead cops when you want them now pegs in a blanket fry bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party conservatism one route Republican speak up have even heard about the guard from Utah\nWho sent rising to the president to kill him\n... have you heard about the white powder the rising attack on the home of Senator Susan Collins by a leftist\nAfter she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh nor all the attacks on Trump's children how big of a story would have been if Republicans had attacked the children abroad Hussein Obama oh my oh my lord of the world would end as we know it\nThe puck receives too much for

beat Donnelly in Indiana\nI don't know\nAnd CNN will not allow the N. word the mob or being used and CNN had a reporter with the caravan the mobs coming up from from uh from Honduras and they polled all that because it was so good for the Republicans even though factually it's going on they did not want reporting on that\nAll day on TALK about that now\nNo because it's good for Trump there in the business of electing isn't it sad when major news organizations or in the business of electing Democrats\nYeah they are\nWell my dad died about ten years ago it said Democrats are liars and cheaters\nThat's all they are well you know you know Danny I I Want an objective media that caused balls and strikes right down the middle\nLet's continue now with Andy in Idaho and not too many calls

news because it's not broadcast over the air but the FCC does control CBS NBC ABC or talk radio et cetera\nBut Andy ultimately we get the government we deserve and if more you know fewer and fewer people are watching CNN all the time you cannot watch Chris Cuomo or Don Lemon on a regular basis without suffering some sort of project vomiting or explosive diarrhea\nEspecially Don Lemon it's impossible to watch it\nAnd their ratings if you take on any particular night\nFox News has more than twice the rating of CNN and MSNBC put together\nAnd there's a reason because we're voting more or less with our eyes to watch and we want to watch\nBut you can't watch it all it would drive me crazy I Want objectivity have you heard the word ISIS recently how many tonight sixty minutes did a story in which ISIS has been killed by a the Trump military Trump said the military go get him\nAn ISIS used to be a big deal under Obama how big a deal is it now Andy\nYou know doesn't exist but I\nThink

only counting others continue with a tragedy\nThe tragedies this week and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas rescuing former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempt to mass murder\nOr whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy or NBC News this morning head on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nHeavy set a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas rescuing former NYPD officer investigator\nDetective and Thomas raskin welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas how're ya\nHey oh goody [laughter] very tough situation an awful um well when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties he had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president\nBecause he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish\nAnd he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing to sell some how Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon and today did ugly reporting\nSaying that ah that in fact a Sarah Sanders put out something a\nFew hours to go to the set is there any tragedy of the Washington Post were not exploit to attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some have said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying to Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like every day who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI not as of yet I've seen is you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the long horsemen or the investigative world when I Can't believe [laughter] no one else was monitoring his tweets social media\nIs other things he was posting couldn't have alerted only went one way you know when you say is a few things to say something\n[laughter] this case you know someone had the same time\nI could've alerted to police the police when you find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or in a lot to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him we can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth to be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting and Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had caught about an Eighteen year old up punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people called in and it wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfect center law enforcement correct\nThere's no production on horse but you're only as good a shift today and wish I could go on for shipping is very easy to do after seeing\nA law enforcement and stuff on it so [laughter] I Know my experience with the NYPD we always look back we always did a review of what happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case and the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back then figuring out what we do better\nIn the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a ... said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics ongoing in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like powers\nWedding for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate\nBefore social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social

mean\nFor litigation investigation instead of blood\nIt's ... and many times in life I say okay who's in favor of that person and it was opposed to that person think of the ones who want Trump to win

eighty four Nineteen eighty eight this is a presidential election you have\nTo get out and vote and sent me a Republican House member back\nTo the Republican back to the house because even if you do not like that house member even if that particular house member did not support that Donald Trump agenda\nTrust me that if they vote for Donald Trump and it is one of the most consequential elections you know the liberal they really know how to use the levers of government delivers of media and the levers of in general you know unfair play much better than not\nThe only one we've ever had as a fighter like Donald Trump this really is Donald Trump's first real like it a lot of ways and\nThis is has started once you get from the day that he was elected they haven't been out to get him how do I notice too because remember in two thousand nine two thousand and\nTwo um rock Obama had a knee jerk reaction to anything that went badly he would just blame it on George W. Bush sure and in two thousand twelve election day remember eight out of ten American blame the overall state of the economy on the Republican fictional blamed it on Bush\nDonald Trump for president in ... in bill you told me I don't remember this ever um but I think this is the first president\nAnd that's it and you know many maybe in the Eighteenth century it happens it happens immediate predecessor out campaigning against them you know I understand the rock Obama didn't respect the office I understand that the rock Obama lived a very charmed life\nAnd I understand that he had no right to be in there of course so if you listen to build a robber Muller he'll tell you know rock Obama's posted Donald Trump deserve to be in the oval but\nJust that idea they're hearing that flat out evidence to show you that they had been out again and they want to take out Donald Trump the fact that Iraq Obama is out there\nAnd once again it goes to are we going to let this great American experiment um continue with by cutting a citizen\nTo office for the first one in modern day history are we going to let the Democrats take over and really hang out at the same time in twenty ninth team you know it's not that far on the corner by around march or April you're going to start came democratic debates for twenty twenty\nNo God can you imagine it'll be like a bar scene from Star Wars

this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some saying it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now\nYou know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest ... is not a humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately describe on the wall Street Journal and organize stunt by political agitator is an activist\nWho are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of his seven seven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place\nAnd said let's walk to American two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened\nWith the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media will deal with\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is a is a nother example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised and criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize\nAnd disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many as Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also a\nMan of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to stay out of this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing ten ... suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me\nWhy don't you take your wife and kids and try walking to Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here is that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably\nThe most important mid term election and your and my life time no I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the wind and the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explained why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with ... million marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intends motor and care all of these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh\nCaravans that are formed the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift are not only destabilize South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTwo or Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance\nBecause it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so
