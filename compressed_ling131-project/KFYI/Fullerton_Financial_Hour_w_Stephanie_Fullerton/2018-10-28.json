{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "So here's what I Want you to go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd sign up for one of our seminars\nOr or visit with one of our advisors or watch videos listen to pod cast read articles all those kinds of things education I think is power\nAnd I want you to learn and we want to be there to be to help you learn that stuff so uh if there's a market prices coming we want you to be ready okay so money matters dot net is the website money matters dot net [noise] All right we're going to take a break and when we come back we're going to talk about how\nTo pass on the fruits of your labor to your greedy washed undeserving airs which is called estate planning so stay tuned this is money matters and I am ...\nWith volatility in the market you may be asking yourself how will this affect my retirement savings will I mean to postpone retiring\nLast one [noise] on the father\nThe country is they hooked on this ... and\nWe are well let me in champagne this is money matters with Ken rape and of course I Am your host can re\n[noise]\nThat could jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nVery on beyond\nAnd you know what buses right we want to help more people\nDo their retirement planning than anyone else that is our goal and uh so um because of bad we primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon and if that is you then we would love to meet you and work with you\nEnd up ... uh recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven\nYear in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that went on that might give it to my clients well this is the part of the show where we talk about how to pass\nOnto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws\nSo if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year okay and so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now\nAnd so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and your play it\n[noise] I Know I\n\nWould say you you know\nGood may be and\nI Am\n[noise]\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed\nTo do the exact opposite it's designed to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay\nSo as I mentioned the gift tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS\n[noise] [laughter]\nAh almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death then it goes to whoever um and they wanted attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax at a happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they die there's no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that but\nThey also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with the with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous than they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can give to\nAnd as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as you said the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that too many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that get tax\nAnd by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child\nThen that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore it doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college I'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo ostensibly pay for the tuition\nGuess what Scott was doing he wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money\nAnd he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ... you know what this does sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember the bury the was that guy's name Barry something who did the gong show he would wake up in time to watch the show on television and\nThen you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money so if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\nAs I mentioned we are affirming that uh we uh we special we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon\nAnd so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website\nAnd when

the members of the tree of life synagogue\nEight to ten years new that financial aid they were taking care of and they were a case of today on our show\nWe've gotten a lot to talk about a lot of things that are important that I Want our listeners and thinking about as they prepare for retirement and perhaps they be as they prepare for that one day that maybe they will lose that ... what does it look like for them and how can they be financially prepared for that\nYou know and this is a big topic it it's certainly something that you know if you if you're\nIf you're working with somebody that doesn't really care about you personally\nLike Stephanie on the team of folks in financial would do for you you know if you're meeting with somebody like that and and somebody passes away there is NO PLAN in place and you're going through Stephanie at that point you're going through one of the biggest emotional stress periods that I Would think anybody could ever go through I mean\nIf something would happen to Steve God Forbid or vice versa something to you and Steve goes on by himself\nEither way I mean you guys have been married forever you've got beautiful kids and grandkids and all of that I mean there's so much love and respect in your relationship that I'm thinking\nThat that would not be something that either one of you wants to go through period but you know you will at some point probably which is not fun to think about and that's really the challenge of this this is not something that people can't wait to get in and talked about but I'm not sure there's more important topic the loss of a spouse creates a lot of issues because\nYou're going to have a loss of a Social Security for example the higher the two stays in you might lose part or all of a pension then\nTo make matters worse I still do by this one I've been married for fifty years somebody passes away and now I'm going to be taxed as a single person and instead of a married couple and now my taxes go up as well I mean there's they're kind of hitting you from all places and if you're in that emotional state and there is NO PLAN in place I Would think there is no place worse to be\n... it absolutely probably the worst place to be and not knowing you know we lost my father in law Mark I'm back in it was Ninety seven than\nWhen I my father in law passed away and I remember sitting at the kitchen table about two months before he passed away and mark that those were the times and even now I Will run into this you know kind of a similar situation but if you remember back there was a point in time in period where\nFinance is just one things that you openly discussed with your family even you know especially if there was one person that handled the fighting\nWhy not pick up the phone right now for the next ten callers at eight hundred nine four seven nine five to ... to that number again is eight hundred\nNine four seven nine five to two and we will give you a free no obligation no pressure whatsoever so why wouldn't you want death at eight hundred nine four seven nine five two to eight customize retirement plan\nYou know another thing stuff that I think it would be a great thing to offer today and I'm a ... you may say sorry I Can't because that that is priceless you can't put a price on that and that is your book living a happy\nHealthy and inspired retirement your definitive financial guy by Steffanie fortune along with husbands Steve it's a fantastic book I've got a copy and I think that's probably the the most that's my biggest asset I have in my retirement plans\nAs I have an autographed copy of that book Stephanie [laughter]\nBut that was a great book I don't I it's easy to understand yes and it's really kind of goes through some of these scenarios as well and the book\nI tell you know also do mark I've been um hosting a smart one didn't finish rich it is a workshop that\nHas been dedicated to speak to win and ... ... a lot about what we're talking about today and I've been hosting these off to the valley I still have um several of them through the end of the year if you would like to come to this workshop please call us at our

women sentence rich it is a must read and it goes right along with what we're talking about today mark\nAbsolutely David ... of course for nine time New York times best selling author or been on Oprah

great opportunity for again that number is eight hundred nine four seven\nNine five to two because here's the deal\nIn seven Seventy said there's no cost and the reason is because a fortune financial\nThey were about helping others are not about oh you got to come in and we got to sell you something you might need something into retirement tool belt but it's about you and your

P.\nDot com you want to call and ask about an eight hundred nine four seven nine five to two is the number eight hundred nine four seven nine five to two now we're talking today about\nA really important topic that nobody really wants to broach\nUntil and you don't want to wait until this happens before you ever have a plan in place is more important as a plan in place before all this so\nIt's going to be such a tough time we're talking about the loss of a spouse and it's really difficult and you know Stephanie to start out there there was really kind of mind blowing but when he's when he really started to think about it it does make sense because women live four to seven years longer than men but eighty percent of men die married\nEighty percent of women die widowed\nAnd I know you've got some other steps that are really hurting the to our conversation today what what else do you want to drop on us\nOkay well let's look at that the average age of a widow HUD is fifty nine ... nine the average age mark ...\nIs what I Would have asked I would've guessed sixty nine or something not fifty nine\nWell I Would have I when I saw the stat I was actually the same as you mark on the ticket yeah man that seems so young but my mother in law was fifty seven\nYeah so it's crazy to think about it the average age of fifty nine not probably not much of a surprise nearly half the marriages right now end in divorce and then they repeat that nearly half of marriages right now and the divorce\nAnd what's interesting is that women typically are less more challenged and the divorce men and I think one of the key reasons is that they don't know where all the money is so when they get married and they end up getting divorced they don't get the right for share their\nBitter saying a good job by them in and hiding some of that I like\n[laughter] no I'm not [laughter] no I'm not I'm not that here's another big burden for when then that ... ... again and now we're focused on the women a lot today but reality is the women\nOut live typically outlive their spouse another big burden and that is the financial and physical burden that we as women carry taking care of our parents lands on our shoulders\nWe primarily become the caretaker of our parents even our husbands so it's so important for me to convey\nWhat we need to be prepared for because once you understand what you should be prepared for them we can come along side you have ... financial and help you be prepared for at I'm remember mark sitting down a couple of years ago ... a a lady had came in the door and I walk in and sit down\nThe conference table and she started out sharing with me how her and her husband and if I named the restaurant right now on on our show many of our listeners would automatically know the restaurant that I'm Talking about but I'm not going to to protect her but I remember her beginning to share with me you know her and her husband how\nThey had these very very successful restaurants here in the valley and\nThey lived on camel back mountain they their kids were in the best private schools and the valley\nEvery year their vacations or exotic and adventurers some and she remembers that\nFirst she knew they were very financially well set very well never questioned her husband about where and what now because she didn't need to at her mind well when two thousand seven and eight and nine began to hit she began to notice a difference has than his moods began to check\nThey were closing down restaurants because they weren't holding up into crisis they were having to remove their children out of the private school and put them into public school\nThey weren't going on vacation like they used to go on and she would question her husband and he would say don't worry it's all fine it'll come back ... actually reminded me of what I heard a lot of a stockbroker say back that don't worry we'll be fined the stock market's gonna come back\nAnd she said she all she knew is that something inside of her didn't feel right in the late two thousand nine she says she got the phone call that nobody ever wants to receive\nAnd that was a phone call that her husband had actually committed suicide he had taken his life over the financial losses that he had had and he could face himself even more he couldn't faces family she says Steffi we went from having everything to me having nothing\nShe felt so hopeless it wasn't and tell unfortunately she lost her parents\nThat they left her a little bit of inheritance so here she is sitting in front of me mark just over fifty nine not much\nWith a little bit of inheritance that her parents had left her and mark she wasn't saying to me oh can you put it back in the stock market sat market is great right now everyone's talking about all the earnings that they're making she's sitting there looking at me she says can you help me make sure", "show_name": "Fullerton Financial Hour w Stephanie Fullerton",
