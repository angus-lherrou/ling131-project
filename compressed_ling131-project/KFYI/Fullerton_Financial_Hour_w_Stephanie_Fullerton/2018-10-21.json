{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Phone retiring is there\nAny [noise] on\nThe country they won ... your wallowing\nIn champagne this is money matters with Ken rape and of course I Am your host can write\n[noise]\nBecky jak I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talk about with our blood and most valued clients\nAnd we're not work with over a thousand families into and they found\nBeyond absolutely and we work with clients in forty three states and\nAll the ideas we talk about on the show these are the same ideas we talked about with our beloved and most valued clients as I mentioned Forbes named our financial advisory firm money matters one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states and without our clients will be nowhere so thank you\nAnd I don't know if you listen to show I Hope you tune in every week at this time because we talk about stuff that if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon is important and uh so we we talk about the estate planning which we're going to do here in just a moment\nBut we also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes are diversification for one case we talk about the whole ... a whole gamut of stuff right and I hope you benefit from it [noise] now this is probably shall we talk about how to pass\nOnto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean or Arab yours and that would be your spouse [laughter] there you go and\nSo this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing is sticking your ear and a Q tip stance for qualified terminal interest property but do we call it a Q tip for short and\nIt's basically a trusted is designed to benefit your spouse so if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that jak can you play it\nI Know I\n\nWould always say you\n\nEye on them\n[noise] and\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the feel of our show this week um\nHas been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters and as I mentioned a little bit ago we ... we're not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly\nIt's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have the national security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in our from what we called vision one hundred billion one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of a ties in with this segment of the show which is an estate planning and passing on to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is a core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\nIf not you don't give love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love\nThen somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe to more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will come to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a from as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all to love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so estate planning which is the topic of this segment is that\nSo let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death\nYou leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact it's the opposite a Q tip trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many\nAnd but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the Q tip trust okay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you get something for you to think about\nSo this show we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that way

advisor\nHas an emerging her level of detail more ability\nThe proceeding has been paid programming we are there\nSo Stephanie the let's talk about where those rovers happen I mean what types of insurance products I suppose but also I think you know the the financial couch where did these rovers happen\nWell you're um you can roll over money between a workplace retirement account I had a gentleman come in just recently works for usa a fact he just turned fifty nine and a half so these are some things that we're going to be talking about in today's show but in this case\nHe had a four O. one K. with his current employer with his current custodian getting ready to retire and he has these moneys that really basically the only control mark that he had if he had the ability to say OK between these four different selections I Want to choose this this this and this\nAnd that's basically the control that he had on that four one K.\nIf the markets go up and down they're not going to make any changes without him telling them that he has to make that change or they want to make the change so he's sitting down with us and we're doing full planning for his retirement looking at when he should take that four one K.\nAnd what we simply dead is we took his four one K. and we began to instruct it to go to our custodian our platform which is the ...\nOnce that four one K. comes over to fidelity than what we will begin to do is we're going to begin to instruct our wealth managers what to do with that four one K.\nAnd knowing that retirement he was getting close to it\nSo maybe retirement is looming upon you what's really important for you to know today is that you have control if you want to know do you have enough money when you retire let's face it folks when you retired the paycheck goes away how are you going to be covering your expenses\nWhat type of lifestyle or do you want to have in retirement think about that you have worked so hard and so long just like this\nAnd then did this last week as we were sitting down now one of the first steps that he took with us is one of the first steps that perhaps you should be taken with us and that is finding out number one what is it that you need to achieve and retirement what does that check need to look like\nYou're going to be working with a team that we have your best interests at heart and we can provide you truly with a fresh professional perspective on your whole entire portfolio showing you how to get an income making sure that we understand risk that you might be carrying how that it could affect you in the future\nThis isn't just some cookie cutter this isn't like looking at a page and here's your force elections pick to that worked best that you feel are you hope\nThis is truly customizing something specifically just for you\nAnd here's what you need to do it's simple\nPick up the phone call eight hundred nine four seven nine five to to\nHave your calendar right in front of you because we was scheduled for you today a very important retirement planning meeting over the next ten minutes for the next ten callers at eight hundred nine four seven nine five to ... to\n... the president and founder of for some financial planning I'm ... with us today for the ... and financial our were your retirement dreams begin with Stephanie on the team at for some financial and we're talking about ... on the program on and talking about ... before on the world the IRA world ... world the insurance world but on the program\nI don't know if this would be the first one because I think we're going to go through all these stuff for the ... this is the one that I always think about but it's certainly something or seeing more and more I guess how about the virtually all of a number that you want to talk about\nLet's first start with the type of your retirement savings account that a lot of people in our audience already have and that's a four O. one K. maybe you've switched employers in many cases you will have the opportunity to take those assets enroll them over into another four one K. that's a possibility\nOr if you want really you have the ability to take that four one K. and roll it into someone like ourselves that we specialize in retirement planning we can help you determine what are the best things\nAre the best resources right of the best investment\nShould just stay in the stock market should you get out of the stock market\nWhat are the important things that you want to happen with that four one K.\nIs that going to be about having an income stream and your future is it not about income stream do you know what kind of sees your pan there's just so many things that we can identify and help you with when it comes to four one K. but the first one that we focus on mark\nIs what are those for one case that you have from prior employers\nIs it still there have you abandon it if you have now is the time for us to evaluate does it make sense to do a roll over\nOn the roller I think that most of us think about when we think of ... is that when we're getting closer to retirement we take the four oh one K. and were rolling into an IRA and that's where you were talking about if you have an old four one K. you certainly can roll it into your new importer four one K. probably may not be the best place for your money\nOr certainly more options I Would imagine stuff and if you went on to an IRA correct\nAbsolutely you are right um what we do is we take that for one case we'd do roll them into a traditional i._r._a.\nBoth types of accounts are considered qualify from attacks perspective what that means is up until this point you've never pay taxes on that money\nInstead what happens it will become tax when you begin to take out distributions typically most people when they are forced to start taking out of distribution it is about the age of seven and a half\nOf which means that if executed according to the rules you can roll over assets from your four one K. into what we call a traditional qualified IRA with out triggering any taxes\nThis is where I was able to help the gentleman that I was working with this week is that he had a four one K.\nAnd he wanted to be able to take more control of it in fact we call it being proactive and not reactive mark what I mean by that is that we want it to begin to work on his retirement plan now\nWe didn't want to wait until the day it's time for him to retire and then start putting a plan together so well we did as we've taken this four one K. were rolling it over into eight qualified I or rape\nOr know taxable event\nAnd we're setting it up we're getting it all ready so when he does go into retirement and just a couple of years now we've got a plan in place for him and as an income plan\nYou know this is one of the areas where it makes us to work with somebody like you and your team at fortune financial because we don't want to trigger taxes because if I took an old four one K. moved to new four one K. but I told my ... some of the truck to me make it out to me if you don't do this right you can call yourself from problem\nRight you want to be careful because if they did make that check out into your named mark you've got sixty days to roll that into an IRA without being taxed and you really don't want to go that direction if you don't have to because again because of some tax law changes just a few years ago\nIf you do it that way then what happens is that you can only do one of those a year so you don't want to be limited on that\nA lot of rules and regulations wanted it comes to these rovers the we're talking today on the program butter with us today for the fortune financial our where your retirement dream to begin with Stephanie in the final one of the ... and run and flooded the IRA rural even though we're touching on there are a role here but one thing that is interesting I think is certainly the four o one\nK through the rough IRA and because of the new talks walls and went into effect in January and this is this something maybe you're looking at even a little bit more often\nAbsolutely right now we we we have the say and taxes on sale you know for the next couple of years there's a lot of opportunity to take advantage of a lower tax rate and here's the bottom line you're going to pay taxes one way or the other you're going to pay taxes so when\nYou roll your four O. one K. into Ross IRA\nWhat you essentially are doing is you're taking that money you're going to go ahead and pay taxes now and if taxes are on sale meaning you're in a lower tax bracket why not take advantage of it\nSo quick question for your loss and a half a million dollars and a four O. one K. more than likely I Would not take about four one K. and move the whole thing into the raw food uh I\nMean the numbers are out on his ear yes or no yeah you want to be careful because you want to be within that with ban of income I think it's like from one sixty five to three eighty five within\nThe first run up to bounce herself out right when you're him\nSo what we do is we call it an exit strategy that's where our team comes into play we're able to sit down with you and evaluate just like you're saying mark\nHow much gets you to the cap because we don't want to go over it we don't want to pay more taxes and we should but when we do that with a Roth IRA we make that conversion we get the taxes out of the way\nWhat now happens is for the next five years as long as we don't tap into it\nIt becomes tax free gains\nSo as you go into retirement the more income that I can put into your pocket tax free like uh yeah the more money that you have to spend in retirement see mark when it comes to planning for retirement one of the first steps can be the hardest\nKnowing where to start can be difficult I think in twenty or so years in the future could it can be overwhelming that's where we come into play\nWhat we do is we help you look at your Social Security market there's so many different ways to take it how do you take it when you take it should you take it at this point that's what we're going to help you the other thing that we help us understand risk\nWe all talk about what if or when or should the markets correct what's gonna happen when mark if they do here's what you could expect your portfolio how will react\nGreat opportunity for you to sit down and stuff in the team of fortune financial and more butter with us today for the forwards and financial our were your retirement dreams begin with Stephanie on the team but for some financial we're talking ...\nSo we talked to ... I wanted a new four one K. we talked for all K to Iran we talked for all and K to ... then we talked about\nThe answer was distribution you can do for when to do an IRA while you're still working other age their rules and regulations runner custodian who's ever running your ... your place of business so that would be certainly something to ask you if you can do it would\nBe a great reason to call Stephanie to make sure that you're in a better position for your retirement must move into the IRA world and we talked for wanted Irish but let's go would I ever taken a traditional i._r._a. and move it into a new traditional Irish would ever do ... to Ira\nAbsolutely traditional i._r._a. to a traditional i._r._a. rollovers are an option that plenty plenty plenty people take advantage of\nOften times when the account holder wants to switch to an IRA to something maybe with better benefits perhaps lower fees maybe less risk more investment choices\nThat is typically what we do it involves taken from the trustee the one of the IRA at the behest of the investor sending the roll over amount to the trustee of the other IRA here again be sure to keep the rules that govern these transactions and mine\nFor example you're only allowed one IRA to IRA roll over in a twelve month period\nThat one that makes sense you'd you'd maybe update is what you're doing your IRA there's new things out there that might make more sense we might go irate IRA for an old one to a new one because of the lower fees better benefits maybe long term care maybe health care I mean there's a lot of different reasons for that so it's\nSuch a one more caller and we'll stay in the IRA world and we talked about the four oh one K. to a Roth IRA well let's go traditional i._r._a. to a Roth IRA\nAbsolutely and this is an important one\nAgain the ability to roll over from a traditional i._r._a. to a Ross IRA\nMoving money into a raw fire aid from additional IRA means the same conversion process that we've discussed in the context of a roll over from a four one K. two are Ross IRA you're going to likely encourage taxes and that tax year\nWhen that conversion is executed but in Des Moines so what you're doing is you're positioning those assets in or off so you do not have\nTo pay taxes later on and mark this is again so powerful especially in the season that we are in taxes are on sale you want to take advantage of that\nNow there are other reasons that you would want to convert a traditional ...\nWith a traditional i._r._a. withdrawals before fifty nine and a half may be subject to a ten percent early withdrawal penalty and less certain exceptions apply things like college tuition those withdrawals are always taxable as ordinary income\nWith a Ross IRA\nThe noun invested that's the basis you want to be careful\nOf the money that I put it into not the gross that I received after\nThat it'll ... so the money that you put in is already been taxed anyway\nWhy put five thousand and two a rough IRA that five thousand\nCan come out without no penalty but if you touch anything the growth that Roth IRA has had before fifty nine\nThere would be a penalty so you just have to be careful on that but here's the great thing about a Roth IRA egg in following the guidelines all the money that you pull out mark is absolutely tax free\nAnd I like that again\nMore taxes in your pocket the better off that I'm putting you at as far as retirement income strategies\nHere's the other thing that is a big difference on a traditional i._r._a. at Seventy eight and a half you are required you\nHave to take out minimum distribution whether you want it or not mark you have to\nHire us what you said all that money and not to us you know they want some of their money back\n[laughter] I wouldn't even go one step further oh you're required to take it but they don't care if you don't take it because guess what they're going to do if you don't take it they're going to penalize you fifty percent\nOf ... it's now Fifteen that's correct so if you know taxes on every dollar\nThat and pay taxes on every dollar so the other difference between the traditional i._r._a. and Ross is the raw you are not mandated you are not required at Seventy and have to take out and\nThere's already worried to detox because we already did it they don't make you take out and then ...\nUsually the rough road is almost like making of the if you're a farmer you want to pay on the seed or do you want to build the harvest right right\nThat's exactly the idea and by far the rough fire a is going to be the most tax efficient it it's amazing to me how many people I sit down with every week and I'm Talking not just one person many of them\nThat will say oh well I'm not really that concerned about taxes and retirement because my tax bracket now I'm not going to be earning the income so it's going to go down and then as I Begin to evaluate their portfolio we begin to look at the taxation what they find\nIs they're right back up and that tax bracket why because they're going to be mandated to take out at minimum distribution\nSo whether retirement whether you're looking at it today you're looking at it tomorrow maybe it's yesterday maybe it's five years down the road the goal is still the same to keep as much money that you can and your own pocket and you do have so many choices that do control your financial present and future\nAnd planning doesn't happen by accident what you need to begin to do is you need to begin to sit down with someone like ourselves is going to help develop for you a well thought out strategy\nWe're going to look at everything mark we're going to look at when should you take your Social Security mark there's over five hundred plus ways that you can take Social Security we're going to show you when to take it wins the best time how to take it no obligation and there is no fee for this\nWe assess the risk that you currently are carrying inside of your portfolio\nYour actual holdings are that's been advisory team we're going to evaluate it and we're going to show you should these markets correct what could you expect to lose\nBut most important will take a look at your retirement goals\nAnd how to support an income stream to give you a comfortable retirement to where you do not have to worry about running out of money if you want to have this type of a confidence when it comes to your retirement and your financial wellbeing\nYou don't want to pass up are offered today are and now says it's completely custom base on you you're unique circumstance as\nIt is limited to the next ten callers who have at least two hundred thousand dollars save for retirement you must call eight hundred nine four seven nine
