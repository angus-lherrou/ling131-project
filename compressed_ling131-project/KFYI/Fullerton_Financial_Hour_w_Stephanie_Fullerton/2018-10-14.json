I think you can benefit from um this is the part of the show where we talk about estate planning we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the\nFruits of your labor and we do this because money isn't everything but it sure keep the kids didn't touch does it not right out of the sports happy\nAnd that's what we want we want happy squirts\nLadies and gentleman you don't want to see unhappy squirt says not a good thing okay so we weren't happy squirts anyway this is the time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful estate planning documents there is I really do and uh so we can\nTalk about that but before we do it Jack and you play it [noise] I Know I\nWould say you you\n... may be and\nI knew\nAnd\nOf course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite we don't want that to happen to you so therefore every week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that\nWill hold the inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes during that entire time so wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty trust basically\nIs an it's its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create it during your lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will upon your dad they read the will and this has created the trust that can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it'll be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and estate taxes why well because for example let's say that uh you know your your daughter gets a divorce [noise]\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the trust inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child they're not so into trust therefore the trust is immune from that\nAnd then also you have a state taxes estate taxes in the in the dynasty trust a ... it's called the generation skipping tax trust because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\n[noise] now while they're living they have access to the money as trustees your children or whoever you've named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health education maintenance and support him H. E. N. S.\nAnd you know hands is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind\nDo they're greedy and watched undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest to you if they're real estate or something like that so talk to your ah financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\nWell\nDorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to want to buy our financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you don't want to go to our website at his money matters dot net\nAnd on that website you'll have a link there and you can click on it which says I Want to sign up for the next seminar and you can do that and when you're there\nDorothy guess what people will get\nThey will get are now world famous oatmeal raisin and chocolate chunk cookies\nAnd folks did you notice I said chocolate chunks I did not say chip you don't want chocolate chip chips made with ... they form and they formed a chocolate with wax it's gross you weren't real chocolate chocolate chunks\nYou want chocolate that melts all over your face gets on your clothes on your notes and everybody's looking at you like what the heck's wrong with you don't you know how to eat a cookie and you're like no or does because our trumpet chunk\nAnd while you're at it you're learning about your finances man it's a deal you can find nowhere else to go to our website\nMoney matters a net now on the off chance that maybe cookies or not what you want to go to us that are for although I Would highly recommend it at the semi we're going to talk about three of the worst enemies you have to your financial well being where you talked about inflation\nGoing to talk about income taxes Barry markets we'll also talk about how to calculate your magic number which is a if you have enough money to retire on\nWe're going to talk about your cash flow ... maximizing cash flow junior retirement we'll talk about what you should be doing with your four one K. right now we'll talk about when you should take Social Security when you're sixty two sixty six when you're Seventy we're going to talk about the fact that the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they want to tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits and we know show you how to beat that if it's at all possible we have so much information at the center I Can't even tell you all about it right now but go to our website money matters dot net\nSign up for the seminar and we'll look forward to seeing you there [noise] you know what I can not believe how fast the show has gone it's over already I Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I enjoy doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] information presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on the subject to discuss ends and not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned [noise] none of the show's content viewed as personalized investment in my professional advisor Cindy can solve them more implementing any of the strategies presented\nNumerous times and other methods in malls varying degrees of written and therefore it can be no insurance at any visiting the investment strategy will be suitable profitable were at my portfolio tax\nIs planning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax\nProfessional regarding years the legal ...\nFounded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of him or rape or N.M W KM advisors and I think the first only tried to visit these days where he doesn't wobbly registered or is it was looted tore them did from registration requirements registration is not an endorsement other firms buy securities regulators and does not mean that the adviser\nHas been emerging in her level of detail more ability\nThe proceeding has been paid programming we are the valleys talk station is used dogs five fifty KFYI Phoenix ...\nPressure on the Saudis this Fox News western nations demanding Saudi Arabia explained the disappearance of a journalist from its consulate in Istanbul Jamal ... show he went to the consulate two weeks ago but no one saw him leave Turkish authorities suspect to show he met his and\nThat's for an F. P. dot com [noise] so what's your sense Stephanie of how well prepared people are for that possibility of maybe living to the age of one hundred and even beyond because it seems like for a lot of people longevity risk probably isn't at the top of their list of concerns about retirement I Would imagine\nWell you know lung jeopardy rest they don't look at it that way but I Do have this mark where a lot of people are very concerned about outliving their money so you know we do talk about that you know I it was amazing I saw a study recently\nAnd it looks like we're only ten percent of the fifty plus pre retirees survey said that they are thinking about this that they are financially prepared for retirement that will\nLast I mean it can last thirty plus years so our goal and even today as we talk I Want to help change that\nYou know a lot of the pre retirees that I talked to a everyday I sense\nThat they do not think about longevity or what it means for them financially if they live a really really long time in fact what did I hear you know recently they they say that the new seventies is that new sixties in the\nSixties isn't new fifty so we are living longer and we want to begin to think about about that I I really believe that longevity is probably one of the most significant risk people need to address\nLeading up to and even during retirement\nIt's important to think about you know what kind of lifestyle is it that you really want our that you've been dreaming about what's that bucket last because that is true retirement planning is all about is that you begin to very carefully planned out how and what you're going to do\nAnd I believe in many cases that the assistance of a financial professional to help develop input strategies in place is very important let's think about it mark it's not like it used to be it used to be ten Fifteen twenty plus years ago\nYou could retire very comfortably knowing that maybe you would get a beginning a pension get his Social Security you weren't living as long maybe until you're late seventies early eighties in fact\nYou can go out and get a CD making what six seven eight plus percent has that that way anymore\nThat's why the central that you're sitting down with retirements specialists that this is what we do we help people put together retirement plans to help ensure that they're not gonna run out of money\nSo you're right we do we sit down with a lot of people um and\nThere's those conversations when I come in on that second appointment is what I call it the market we do on that first appointment we're going to take a look at what they have ... we're going to you know figure out you know how far they are from retiring maybe there are still um contributing\nTo a four O. one K. or an IRA a and maybe they even have the ability to do what's called a catch up provision where they can\nAdd more to their four one K. that the most important is that we want to make sure they're maximizing every asset class it they they can because we want to prepare them we want them to understand their numbers ... what we will do them once we gather we call it um that first consultation the gathering information\nWe will then go and put together a very detailed plan that shows them okay here's where you're at\nIt becomes very transparent to them if they have accumulated enough assets do they have a Ninety or Ninety five percent probability that what they've done is going to last throughout their lifetime\nAnd there's times it's a hard conversation mark we come back in and we show them that maybe there's a fifty or sixty percent probability that they have done what's right that they are on track\nTo be able to retire and have enough money and then what we're able to do is we're able to put together some strategies that maybe that sixty percent probability all of a sudden becomes and Ninety percent probability that they are on track\nWhere we're able to give them some ideas and some solutions but it really is about understanding where your numbers are let's see if you're ready if you're not ready how can we help you get ready\nYou know what I think this brings up above the bottom line to retirement as you have to have him come you've got to replace those paychecks are no longer coming in so that stuff if I came in and sat down with you and I said here's my stuff right you'd say well that stuff\nBut really paychecks right for retirement I mean we have to figure out a way to convert assets into income don't we\nAbsolutely it's the most important part of retirement planning you know I sit down every day with so many people it's surprising to me\nThat I Would say mark nearly I don't know Seventy plus percent of people that walks through our door do not have a written plan it just it it shocks me that they have not taken a look at what are the things that they have\nTo be again because you're right there is no retirement without income\nAnd more people are willing to risk at this point trying to rush to become rich the more willing to risk what they have to be rich instead of guaranteeing that they'll never be poor\nBut maybe that is a big heart server interrupting you but that is part of your book living a happy healthy and inspired retirement your definitive financial guides Stephanie ... wrote the book and maybe if you're nice to Stephanie she'll give you an autographed copy and now you're you're set for Germany because that is priceless\nYou might be able to sell out on E. bay for millions of dollars [laughter] an autograph on al ... and your book you say do you want to risk getting rich or do you want to make sure you weren't never poor\nExactly and it just like\nI don't understand how there are people out there advisors out there that are not helping put plans in place for these baby boomers that are getting ready to retire I mean that's I mean they've done incredible job accumulating these four one K. ... an incredible job I'm putting together\nThese um portfolios but what they haven't done is they have an established where the money's gonna come from when to take Social Security\nWhere what retirement account or you're going to begin to Paul from if they don't have a pension how are they going to create a pension\nYou know maybe you maybe you been good at diversification maybe you've got rental property maybe you've got an annuity but here's the key you got to be given to figure out what rate that you want to begin this then don't spend down those assets because you want them to last as long as you need it\nSo at the end of the day what you're saying is that really everybody needs a retirement income strategy correct\nAbsolutely that's right no matter how long you expect to live you need some type of blueprint you certainly would not go out and build a house without a blueprint you would not built a house without knowing how and when\nTo put the ... and lay the foundation nor do many people\nNow and now I'm going to say preface this with most people do not start a vacation without knowing whether going it's amazing to me that most people mark put more time and energy and planning a vacation\nAnd building their house than they do planning for retirement it's it's very important that you take time and I think one of the\nBiggest reason that people don't put the time into it is they're just concerned that they're going to do the wrong thing that's why sitting down with a retirement plan or\nMakes all this sense and the world because we believe there are so many choices\nThat you have when it comes to your current and present and future finance is that you don't want to just go at\nThis happenstance you want a well thought out strategy for retirement you want it developed with a professional retirement specialists\nWho understands the big picture you certainly wouldn't build a house with somebody that didn't understand how to put the pieces together you certainly wouldn't go on vacation knowing that you had to get on a plane and and and\nHow you feel think about this mark how would you feel if the pilot got on the record or the announcement the microphone and said this to you today folks were heading to Florida\nAnd there's a fifty or sixty percent probability that we're going to land safely today\nMark how would you feel might make me just a little nervous maybe\nGlee but yet people come in and that's exactly what is happening when we do the analysis of weather currently at there's a sixty or sixty five percent probability that they're going to land safely we don't want that for our clients we want\nTo hit a hundred percent or Ninety or Ninety five percent probability that they're going to land in retirement safely and it takes a lotta
