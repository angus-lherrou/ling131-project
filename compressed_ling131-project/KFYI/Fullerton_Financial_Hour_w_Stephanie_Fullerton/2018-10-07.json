E. N. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle\nThey can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter] okay [laughter] so they have to they have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money you can name a different trustee to help with that\nAlso if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children and you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust\nSo there are lots of advantages to the Q tip trust and they can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new ... husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property but cue tips easier to say [noise]\nAnyway um if you would like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit\nNow when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon okay so that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire financial life not just your estate planning so we want to help you with Social Security decisions we want to help you with a retirement planning decisions\nOr income tax decisions you know all those kinds of things that impact someone who is retired are retiring soon we want to help you to make those decisions\nAnd if we can help you that's fantastic will do it at no charge obligation and if we can I help you that's fine too okay so either way we will part French\n\nDorothy is not too wonderful to be true because it is true so do that okay now if you don't want to go directly to an advisor than what I Would recommend is that you go to one of our seminars okay and we have seminars near you if you can you hear my voice there was a seminar near you pretty much\nAnd uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net at the same or we're going to talk about the several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions are going to talk about how to protect yourself from the next market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\nA we'll talk about ah do you have enough money to retire on all those kinds of things that we will talk about at the center or some money matters dot net for all of the above well you know what Jack\nI cannot believe that the show's over already well ladies and gentlemen I Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nInformation presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on the subject was gone in and not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security mentioned none of this show's content viewed as personalized investment by a professional advisor Cindy can solve them in more implementing any of the strategies presented\nTime nothing investments involved with varying degrees of written and therefore it can be no different than any specific investment strategy will be suitable profitable for my portfolio tax\nPlanning information offering on this program is general in nature always been solved and attorney or tax\nRational regarding years that they like legal ... founded ... judge should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of ... or ...

I'm just taking a chunk of money out and now setting it aside and putting on where I wanted to go right maybe explain that a little bit if you would\nYeah exactly so I and this is a great great point Marc because I ate all most of the time a lot of people come in they didn't even realize that at fifty nine and a half that they could roll that four one K. out to take control of that let's face it that\nFour one K. is really being brand by then meaning yes the company is managing the custodian as managing that four one K. but it's up to that employee to say OK I Want that I Want that or I Want that you know you're hoping that you're making the right selections but\nMost people don't even fully quipped to know what selections they should be making so we bring a lot of value to our clients by

when it comes to retirement and there are a lot of area so you help your clients worth because we've talked about it for some financial is independent you're not answering to a board of directors nobody's telling you what you have to talk to your clients about it's your decision\nAnd your decision is based on what do you is what is your client need which is where the producers standard comes in\nYou are morally legally ethically obligated to do was in your client's best interest and then your retirement planning professionals so building this retirement income plan is really kind of start because you always say the retirement starts with income\nI mean you talk about investments and how are you going to go about setting up that part of your portfolio you talk about taxes you know where you got to be tax efficient what about healthcare we've got to certainly plan for that as well\nAnd then legacy planning what are you know how do you want and where do you want all of your stuff to

mean all of these things are important health care inflation taxes uh\nIncome foundation so you know you know I talked to a little bit about this couple that I've been working with that needed forty thousand dollars in addition to their Social Security\nAnd one of the questions that they had for me as we were sitting there doing a full um you know mark when we do these preparations strategy sessions we deep we you know we want to know what is it that you've worked hard for what are the different things that you've accumulated in one of the things that I see this\nHappening a lot with people that are getting ready to were preparing to go into retirement\nThey may be of had this house for that they've lived in for all these years and they're going to downsize they sell it now they've got this cash sitting in the bank and they'll you know they'll ask Vito what should we do with this cash you know they understand that [laughter]\nThey're not going to leave it in the bank at point oh five percent and but they're not going to buy a CD making less than ... percent\nAnd maybe they need it ready you know liquid or maybe they don't need it liquid that's a key component to building an income stream so what we will do you know just like this couple they had just sold their house and they had a couple of hundred thousand dollars that they didn't need readily available\nAnd they wanted to use it for cash flow now here's what I mean and mark I always say that the to me income is something that you have to have income is something that you need to maintain lifestyle cash flow it's something that you liked to have\nTo do the extra things with do see where I'm going with this an income from gosh income you have to have\nTo pay the bills cash flow is what all us women like to have because we can do that extra shopping are for you men maybe do that extra golfing or couples want to travel so they wanted they said to me ... we want to be able to take this chunk of money and we like to\nCreate a little bit more cash flow for them it was five hundred dollars extra month that they want it to be able to do\nSo again we began to look at what was going to bring them the best guaranteed cash flow income stream that we could provide for them\nThan based on that circumstance than we created additional cash flow so again markets about sitting down and
