onslaught we're talking about the media going over time trying to lay this murder at the feet up our president\nOr you have to ask why is this happening and I do think it's happening in part because

the world and now the accusation is that you have a world leaders the very world leaders at the left tells us no longer respect the president\nAre somehow picking up on the president's you know news is the enemy of the people and using it now that to justifiably kill the opposition to kill the journalist\nAnd then let's face it we have a president who say they're also they say so for a values like freedom of speech to satisfy\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world and that's a line that I think it's getting much worse and and so this vacuum a penny advocacy for democratic values I
