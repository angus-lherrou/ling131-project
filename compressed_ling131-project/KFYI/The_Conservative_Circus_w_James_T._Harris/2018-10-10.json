trying to push their agenda for the November elections have you been hearing anything lately about a another teacher walkout\nI have not heard anything lately early on I heard that they were planning that but I don't think the support is there for a walk out\nI think that the teachers know and understand that the governor did give them what they asked for and to walk out now with the chili political it would be destructive counterproductive I think they're wise enough to know that this is not the way\nThat they should be acting it's gonna hurt parents it's going to hurt children and it's going to hurt them and so I I haven't heard anything and I hope that it just talks on the handful of these activists and are actual teachers know better and will stay there for the kids\nWe have Arizona State representative Kelly towns in on the line I have a very controversial question for you you just said that the teachers to realize that the governor governor doozy gave them what they were asking for is for this pay raise as time goes on do you feel more vindicated for your no vote\nI stand by my no vote and I I have a hard time with going forward to continue to fund education if

kids' school we're tired of it and I have a hard time\nI'm wanting to continue continue to fund that so I stand by my no vote for that reason and also I I'm worried about where we're going to be in three years um\nBasically I I'm trusting and President Trump and the and the governor and our economy getting better I'm crossing my fingers that it does we're in trouble if it doesn't but we we did it you know\nThat's the direction we're going and um and this whole idea of pushing socialism and making us about politics has fizzled out\nBut I tell you what representative towns and you were one of the few people who were truly standing up and pointing out how this red red bull but then how socialism I'm an indoctrination is just a rapid in the public school system and so on that point I give

Arizona where he helped in the effort to establish a new substation\nAt three points Arizona are the Arizona daily independent reported last week on what the border patrol called a quote humanitarian crisis\nThat is quote impacting border security\nThe flood of illegal aliens is increasing and it appears the government is ... is really no longer detaining them aren't what is going on on the border\nCats generally damn the catch and release it been going on for quite some time I did it many times when President Trump first took office\nIt was a very ... point and the immigration crisis where the agency could have done something about it you know enforce the laws that are already on the book because that's what it comes down to if there's no consequences for any legal action there's no reason for the criminal to stop committing that illegal action\nAnd that's what's going on uh the agency failed to be on it and a lot of it has to do with we have so it's been a revolving door at the same individuals\nThat have been running border patrol under the Obama administration or the individuals that are running it now so they're sitting there idle waiting and hoping for a change in twenty twenty and they hope they don't have that you know the left or the right\nBut they they're not they're just don't do anything they're just going to sit there and not do anything about the immigration crisis and\nHopefully when there's a change of command it can turn around and say hey look we weren't really under the guise side we didn't do anything you you thought we weren't talking\nAnd I think a lot of the parent when you see who's on to you who's on the on the other major media who's on your show you don't management won't get on to show them they won't defend the actions of the president because you know they're just too busy trying to\nSave ... be safe and and save their their hierarchy and the kingdom building that they've been doing for many years\nWe have our ... on the line vice president of the national border patrol council and president of local twenty five forty four are can you tell us a little bit about the latest inspector general's report are they trying to blame Trump the Trump Administration for this latest surge\nYou know when it comes down to the numbers that are in August ... ... talk before I was on your show and we talked about the numbers the numbers were up higher than they've been in and even Obama era time\nIf it's not it's not on the president I truly believe that we miss the mark where it could fall on President Trump is he he hasn't really cleaned up the swap though he's allowed for the individuals that were here during the Obama administration within our agency to continuously be there and and and be promoted\nYou as in essence wrong said but he has been cleaned up the swamp but at the same time um there are a lot of barriers to the president cleaned up that's my business you\nKnow they're definitely and that's why the blame you know when he took office and obviously we we lead the charge down here in Tucson you know the local led the charge and endorsing President Trump for his campaign and we're still very hopeful we're still hope you can get on the right things are done\nBut it comes down to that James you there's too many people in petted within our agency that were here during the past administration and we understand it takes time ah but those individuals need to start being held accountable\nWe have our ... vice president of the national border patrol\nUm are liberals and liberal outlets like the Arizona Republic are trying to dismiss governor do she's border task force what's the real truth about this whole thing to do you know the truth behind this\nWhen you have an entity like that that helping you know detained and a decommissioned the amount of drugs that are into this country so I work in the Tucson sector and you got to remember where the Tucson sector alone\nIs responsible for close to forty percent of all the drug users in the entire country that astronomical that's why when you see\nWhat governor do the has done it's important when you see the uh the idiots down here in my county refusing to take the money to help law enforcement\nYou know with these type of drug interdiction operations I'm Talking about you know the ... task force is down here with operation stone garden it's just ridiculous [noise]\nUh I I I don't want to sit here and use your show came the ... as a way to promote but people need you you know the elections are coming and you can't stay at home and say oh so and so it was going to win any way because there's a certain group of people in you know who they are\nI Will pay the laws that are out of the country that is what it comes down to it has nothing ... nothing to do and racism it has everything to do with loving people that are inside your home\nArt Dale ... and I agree with them um and that's why we do put above fences we\nPut up walls we lock our doors right here though in the valley we had the Phoenix church that is providing temporary shelter to about one hundred asylum seekers are released by immigration and Customs Enforcement just like a duck or don't tell me that's catch and release\nThe shadow rock unified church of Christ um they send the statement that the church is among several organizations around the state who were asked by ice to help so it's not like they're breaking into kind of laws I mean but there's so much an overflow at the border that\nAs we just heard there being overwhelmed they're being overrun because of this catch and release policy\nI said the release the individuals and families to try to stay in compliance with rules on how long they may be held\nAt detention centers this needs to change but before we changed any of this\nBefore we can get down to the the nuts and bolts of of these type of actions gotta get that wall up and the big news today is that there is money being appropriate it for that wall now of course it may get through the house\nThen we're going to have to uh get it through the Senate which is another nut to crack altogether because you'd need at least sixty votes but maybe as a president keeps winning or we're going to start to get more people starting to cross over or why do you say that James\nBecause there's a new poll out there is a new

do\nA one of the things that they they took umbrage with was the president also coming out and apologizing to the cabin a family on behalf of America\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett\nAnd the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been

by the president of explaining to people who don't pay attention to politics what happened to the Kavanaugh family as a result you had independence that are now moving away from the Democrats they disapprove of the Democrats' handling\nOf Brett Kavanaugh a by a margin of twenty eight points\nI'm telling you this back fired big time of for the Democrats\nAnd something else is back fighting for

the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect is strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nEverything is turned around here actually is the Democrats that demeaned the confirmation process it was the Democrats from the moment Chuck Grassley opened his mouth to start the proceedings they kept interrupting interrupting so wanted to\nCancel the whole it from the very beginning before we even got the charges of of Kavanaugh being a gang rape is the Democrats were disrupting the whole process so for me to sit there and say that is ... uh the bizarre but let us back up\nBecause what she said before that I think is truly dangerous Hillary Clinton you can't be civil to the G O
