emotional day to say the least he edited playing Captain America for the last eight years has been an honor\nGot to say they're also long term Republican risks because you see that the idea of women who have survived sexual assault that's not a partisan issue that affects Republican women as well as democratic and one of the concerns that some Republicans have ever the long term they are going to lose support proud of that from\nWomen especially better educated women I and then it will take a long time for them to win them back when this fight is I don't\nKnow too that I don't know that I agree with you on that I mean a lot of these educated women or they have sons that they raise up just like a a a judge Kavanaugh's mom was educated she happened to be a judge\nI'm sure she's not appreciating the Democrats and how they're treating her son was a lot of moms\nOut there to the kind of freaked out by what the Democrats by the new narrative that you're guilty of before uh before you're you know you have to be proven you had to prove you're innocent\nThat's that's crazy\nSo I don't know if there's going to be a backlash against the G O P to be quite honest with you I think the backlash is going to be against the donkey party because they've been acting like a bunch of asked this is\n\nNo we have um Chuck Schumer here's something that's really really dangerous I Want to play a couple of clips from Chuck Schumer and I want you to really think about what he's saying here Chuck Schumer first commenting on the the FBI's process\nThere's only one document for a hundred members to see in the course of the day\nVery hard to do in a lot of doc is only one copy of these documents won't ten copies in [laughter] the heck is going on here but it's just a pattern\nAccess to fat limiting access to truth limiting access to what the American people ought to know\nRight um first of all of this is not something that the American people to know things to Obama or the second thing that you need to understand here Chuck Schumer and I think you do but you just kind of goofing around here it's the only reason why there was one copy instead of panic 'cause y'all league stuff\n'cause you you league stuff you only have one letter from a from Christine Blasey Ford look what happened with that and then that letter she says she didn't want to she wanted to be anonymous how how did that work out for a a Chuck\nCome on now the only one copy because Democrats leak\nThat's why Chuck Schumer\nAnd so I reiterate my call peculiar after receiving a briefing about what the documents contain but they the may ... obviously there has to be a ...\nWhat what what ... they may be made public obviously with the with the proper reductions what's the matter what\nYou said what you what are you not understanding here see here's what he to me it goes off the rails\nThat they'd be made ... obviously there has to be appropriate reactions and there should be to protect the privacy of those who were interviewed but there's no reason on God's green earth that those documents can't be made public yeah the minutes and people decide no\nNo see it's not the American the American people are ready to fight each other\nThey decided one day a lead did Donald Trump Donald Trump is that there's going to give us\nConservative justices that the American people decide what you were advocating is mob rule which you're trying to usher in the French Revolution which is the Chuck will's widow republic not a democracy this is why I say that word things\nA democracy looks like mob rule a democracy\nLooks like the French Revolution which was bloody and we're getting dangerously close to that\nBig we because we have Democrats been have weaponized the whole system no those documents should remain behind closed doors they should remain secret let the representatives of the people look at the documents and then you vote up or down whether you want Kavanaugh
