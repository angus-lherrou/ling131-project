have taped her what she was teaching in class and I go there that they may release that so we can see what she sounds like regularly [laughter]\nWe're also finding out that the word the place you she says she ran to after she was a sexually assaulted da da da da da da and the year she said the ... the\nAssault happened is falling apart but you know what\nThat does it matter this is why the left has moved dog the boot off from sexual assault\nOnto character onto drinking on to actually you know he got in a bar fight be through ice all this stuff that's out there and the ... the\nLeft is grabbing at straws they just cannot let this go through no matter what\nYou have a senator Cory Booker he said it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if if Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent it does it matter\nAlternately not whether he's innocent or guilty but there's not a trial the ultimately has enough questions the rain that we should not move on to another candidate\nAnd that long list put together by the Heritage Foundation and the federal society move on to another candidate because\nUltimately the Supreme Court is not an entitlement just because he went to jail or prison in your class doesn't entitle you to the Supreme Court\nThis is a sacred institution and the people that should be on it whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy at all the people who should be on the Supreme Court to preserve the integrity of the court and be beyond reproach of these difficult times yeah\nI'll be I'll be how can you be ... reports\nBeyond reproach of difficult part is in times when the partisan they'll just throwing money at you there was nobody that President Trump can put up that will be that would be good enough for the Democrats because they don't like Trump and they don't like conservatives so what Cory Booker just sit there was ... by\nShy\nSimone Sanders she is a a a punted on C.

Shakur [laughter]\nIf Kavanaugh had told told other lie under oath I'm going to call them live for example I got an a yellow my own grandfather when the ... why are you lying about that so I'm not going to lie\nAbout that he's going to lie about what a devil's triangle and if he's not going to be forthcoming and truthful about how much he did drink why why is it hard for us to believe that he's not telling the truth yeah\nWell why why did you ever talk about his drinking why we why are we are the best of gives you about how he got into a\nTo yell I thought this whole\nThing was about the sexual assault see they don't have that they can't prove that so they got to try to move on Simone Sanders\nI think what I find that exchange and someone who was a who isn't judge who was a skilled attorney who was who was walking around the words to try to constrain himself to this little thing but cannot believe all in this scenario and so\nIt it I Know it might feel unfortunate that the thing that's going to think that cabin on the fact that he lied about how he liked to get down in college but I'd like to remind everybody that Bill Clinton and page one\nLie about I'd love to really know she didn't say that oh gee\n\nI'm Bill Clinton lie before a grand jury about that and another things but my goodness gracious Simone Sanders just such as you kiss your mother with the mouth [noise]\nYou've got a a Senator Patrick Leahy I remember at the skit about a Brett Kavanaugh decode opening a and this is all to do this all the media does this is the is called propaganda\nOr something happens and then from the view they get a hold of it and then all of a sudden you start seeing it on the cable shows throughout the day and by the time to get around to late night TV you know all of the the talkers from a a Jimmy Kimmel to all these people did they get a hold of it and then Saturday Night they feature read and then it becomes like\nReal sort of like how how of Sarah

fourteen states women in the workforce African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and youth unemployment let's start there I Am not\nGood and you know that's the key right now had I offer
