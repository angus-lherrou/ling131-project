listen to it we got into a back and forth over two kids that you know what a mister here's the telling the truth I listen to that song you know\nThere's something to that\nWell you know what there is something to if you allow yourself to be filled up with all kinds of hate and and and and you're on the edge or you've got different issues you know what there's something to being careful about what we say\nRabbi Jeffrey Myers\nWorse if have must see I'm I spoke Monday evening I think was the visual the days of melted into one I've lost track of of what they say even as\nI said so or lick the leaders that your leaders we turn to you you're the models for our country when you speak worse if have when you speak ill of the other candidate any worse if hate Americans listen to you they get their instructions from you when you speak words that faith you say to them this is okay you can do it as well\nYeah um when you speak words rate\nRabbi Jeffrey Myers is saying you know you and me speaking directly to politicians your words of hate influence each other and blue as other people you said more with a little bit deeper rabbi Jeffrey Myers\nSo I turned to all of our elected leaders because hates us and no political party hate is not flu hate is not ready to hate is not for faith is all I turned to them to say toned down to ... of of loves the force of decency enough respect

I Believe the rabbis right about that as well there's only one problem with this you know I don't really hear\nAnd maybe people could challenge me on this words of hate flew in from the right side of the political Lyle\nI don't I Know you've accused the president obscene hateful things is the way you burn chirping and it and then you have people who watch your shows would you continue to just drumbeat of hate and then they begin to act on it\nYet politicians telephones to get up in people's faces guess what you're getting up in their faces yet politicians are saying you don't harass other politicians from the opposite party at a restaurant the gas stations and guess what they're doing\n\nSo I I Believe the rabbi is onto something but I Believe we're so quick to say\nBoth sides need to settle down\nAnd this was a an instance of this happened on the Katie Katie tour sure she was with Erick Erickson a talk show host\nAnd their little back and forth and I don't know if that I totally disagree or agree with Eric Eric with here but listen to how\nKatie ... list of how she gets triggered\nBy the very notion that we both should step\nBack and calm down\nAlso think there are folks on the other side who need to tamp down the rhetoric is well we had rice it attacks Susan Collins and Ted Cruz last weekend protesters chasing people at a restaurant so I think both sides need to calm down which is\nOne reason I think it's it's not very helpful right now is who started at both sides can say the other side I did\nWhat we need to come to us a drink can consensus on is that both sides need to stop turning the base over to the fringe and the angry mob and actually returned to the better angels of ourselves that actually try to get things done but I don't know that either side really wants to it was on the other acts", "station": "KFYI", "city": "Phoenix"}
