homeless criminal\nRobbing the ex mayor the acting mayor who\nAbsolutely destroyed our police force ignored all their needs and after promising to end homelessness watched it like a hundred and forty nine percent in his tenure this one is straight out of his backyard right into his pocket\nHow did the hatchet man get to the homeless hatchet man get to this neighborhood I understand it's a nice

not a joking matter violent crime is up\nOur police response times even in\nThe most emergency emergency situations when life life and death is on the line a response times are up over about twenty percent\nAnd so you see violent crime up you see murders unsolved murders we drop from eighty back to about thirty ... thirty percent of the murders were actually solving I mean if you want to get
