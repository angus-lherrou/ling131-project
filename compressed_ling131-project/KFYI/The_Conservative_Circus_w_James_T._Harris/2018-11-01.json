Thirteen issues he goes over I'm just going to go over quickly for one was original intent\nIf we're going to look at a wall or an amendment we've gotta look what was the original intent\nOf it and clearly here it was not for illegal aliens to become their children to become citizens\nNumber too though is history of the law that was passed the amendment was the history of it how we looked at\nHow we practice did number three is you know precedence Supreme Court cases how was the Supreme Court ruled on these types of things and there are some Supreme Court cases\nThat have been passed on birthright citizenship but the only ones that I have found and these are passed in the late Eighteen hundreds and so on had been reassuring and reaffirming that those who work here legally\nThat are not citizens but they are here legally and known by the government their children can become citizens I have not and I'm waiting to see any Supreme Court cases that absolutely say or somebody that is your illegally can have their children become citizens that's not there\nAnd then the fourth major reason he discusses is longevity up the custom\nOr what can become common law so if we are against birthright citizenship for illegal in this country out of those four different things that I brought up original intent is really the one to plant a flag on because the history of this\nPretty much has allowed a sense the inception of the fourteenth amendment for anybody hear their children to become citizens but we have to remember back in the Eighteen hundreds James T there weren't many quote illegal immigrants you know coming to this country there were some\nUh and there were some some cases on that but not many a Supreme Court cases have only talked about legal residents but this has been going on a long time\nSo in the end you know there's two ways to change this and if the president\nAnd again I like it that he brought up this you know what's going on but it really is to Congress to make these changes what they can do is really tight really tried to clarify or what that term means James take\nYou know we have you when you see what that term means by the way we have Jeb Bush on the line he is the constitutional expert\nColumnists in say when you talk about clarifying with that term means and the job of the Congress and the minute or so what exactly are you saying\nSo what I'm saying is that Congress needs to step up and find what subject to the jurisdiction there of means\nThat they need to go back and make the hard decisions and and step up because the power is an article one of the constitution that gives them our over naturalization an immigration now I think an act of Congress is enough\nTo clarify this issue however there are constitutional and legal scholars that I respect that do believe the constitutional amendment will be required because the history and and how we've gone so long with this custom\nOf allowing anyone that is born here to become a citizen now I Would disagree with that because I Believe the absurdity of what we have become accustomed to\nA you know should be self evident and that the Congress because they've been given these powers should be able to pass a law of clarification that should be able to clear this issue up\nWhich I Want to thank you very much for your time today um it's it's it's amazing because the when we watch the media they make it sounds so simple so cut and dry but because of our constitution and because basically we don't have our branches of government that are doing their job it becomes convoluted\nYeah the Congress likes to hide behind a you know the Supreme Court and the president but they need to stand up and at least day would be the first a branch of government that should lead the charge here absolutely\nThe brilliant adjust butch I you know and\nAgain when it comes down to is is this is why I had a little bit of beef with a speaker of the house Paul Ryan ... Jeff which is correct this is the job of the legislature they pass a law defining what you know an American citizen is\nAnd then of course you know people are upset with did they sued them to go to the Supreme Court and they decide whether or not is unconstitutional\nAnd that is not the president you know ... wasn't he signed it into law then it gets to then it if it's unconstitutional and if\nNot the boom it becomes law we have clarity right now we don't have clarity and we had the president's talking about executive order which may not be in his ... Burr view and we have Congress sitting on his assets doing\nNot saying nothing and sort of problem ... says because the Nineteen sixties\nWe have left these that purposefully misconstrued the fourteenth amendment to include\nAnchor babies and chain migration and all this kind of mess\nIt's it's crazy but at the end the day we don't have a Congress that wants to do anything about it and so we go around in these terrible circles\nPresident Trump caught a lot of blame get a lot of attention will be for this issue and I I credit him\nFor bringing it up I also credit to president for going to visit the synagogue independent visit the people who were shot in the massacre that happened over the weekend would I don't appreciate\nIt was stressful he blamed me by my credit card debt and I

fighting forces\nYou also has been a lot of time on the leadership and freedom center in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania you know Jeff there's been a lot of talks about the fourteenth amendment in the last few days specifically because President Trump is that the you know what these these anchor babies this\nA birthright citizenship is something that needs to go is not originally part of the constitution and he said that he can use the executive order\nTo um amend if you will the fourteenth amendment uh\nI Know a lot of folks have had a problem with that and he's brought the left and the right and\nYou know anti Trump were together once again to say no you can't do that I wanted to get your take on what should be done\nWell it's kind of funny because in watching some of these pundits on TV all the sudden become experts on the fourteenth amendment\nAnd constant in the constitution unconstitutional history it's kinda funny uh the the really good thing that comes out of this James tea is that we have many on the left becoming very interested in the constitution\nAnd it kind of gets my gander up somewhat but I'm Glad to hear them you know that they're interested in it but where first of all where were they with Obama's executive orders\nYou know especially is amnesty to four million illegal aliens that we're here you know the Obamacare a executive orders changing that law so so you know we're glad to have them on board at least wanting to study the constitution\nBut getting into your question it is a complex issue but I think President Trump for actually bring\nIt up because it's something that we need to take care of something that we need to be interested in and look at because it is something that is not going on that is that is really correct\nIn in the United states of the way people are becoming citizens however\nIn short and then I'll explain later I Do not believe a President Trump does have the power or forty delegated to him to change the way that we look at birthright citizenship in this country\nYou mean by by using the executive order\nCorrect by using executive order clearly states in section in article one section eight of the constitution that naturalization in immigration a you know the powers there up our vested in the legislative branch\nAnd basically what we have is people are looking to the fourteenth amendment\nAnd and saying that OK all ... person's you know born in the United states are citizens but the the phrase subject to the jurisdiction there of is the one in question so we've got to go back and look and see what that means\nWe have just boots on the line he's a constitutional expert Jeff when you talk about the fourteenth amendment though uh I mean in in an anchor babies or however they want a phrase that today is strikes me is really\nGiving sword site to the real history behind is this the fourteenth amendment was about slavery and making sure that slaves were seen as citizens so how ... how all of a sudden they become something that's for people who are in the country illegally having babies\nWhat your actual absolutely correct look the original intent you can go back and read the debates of the thirty ninth Congress these are the people that debated what the fourteenth amendment that\nAnd the absolute highest purpose for this is they want to to reverse the Dred Scott decision\nSo the Dred Scott decision uh Eighteen fifty seven fifty eight basically said that black people ... you know could not become citizens and so they wanted to make sure that former slaves and even free blacks\nOr or or free blacks in the north states could not be denied citizenship by any state whatsoever north or south and so that was the primary intent but also they did talk about legal residence that we're here knowingly by our nation that their children\nWere or could become citizens with few exceptions to you know like ... that came to the country and so forth and so on but absolutely what is clear it ... it was not discuss nor agreed upon that illegal aliens are those that are here without the permission of our government\nHad any right to have their children become citizens in effect what that if if that's the argument then you could say that an invading nation could come in and take over part of the United states and had children and they would become you know citizens of this nation and that
