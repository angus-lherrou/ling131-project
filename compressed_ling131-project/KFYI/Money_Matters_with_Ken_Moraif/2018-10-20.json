{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Next big bubbly sign is the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals\nOkay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines then they've had an ad I think it anytime and history if I remember correct but they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people are barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stocks that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy\nSo what's happening is people are taking the money they have and buying stocks because most people are massively behind the eight ball you know I saw stay on the other day that if you look at people even in their sixties\nAverage person has something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere it with all due respect in retirement to really get to where most people need to be you're talking millions which means most people aren't going to get where they need to be you can still do better but you know most people are going to be in the hole on that\nBut a hundred and Seventy five it's not close\nBut what's amazing about it is almost all equity in houses\nNow part of what's driving the equity in houses is\nThe root for real estate mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again a big key and the top when you have\nThis much margin debt what happens is is that is people borrow more and more money to buy stocks so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it\nSo you borrowed the rest of it well as their stocks go up in value you get more borrowing capacity so you don't actually have to solve the stocks so all this money gets created and that creates demand\nNow at the same time companies are buying back their own stock which is limiting supply so this push us stock prices up and you have this ... this virtuous cycle as people get more borrowing capacity to borrow more money they don't have anything else to do with the money 'cause nothing else was give them a decent rate of return so they keep buying more and more stocks\nBut what always happens in these cycles is is that when the fed stress raising interest rates than all of a sudden the margin dead doesn't become as attractive as it used to be actually saw a thing today that if you're borrowing less than about fifty granted Schwab on margin right now it's costing you nine to ten percent\nOkay that's a big number and all of a sudden that isn't as attractive is stocks aren't going up so fast you combine that with again you know a big change in the house in ... this fall and all of a sudden social mood starts changing\nPeople aren't as optimistic there's not as much confidence it's two years of what you've just been through on the cabinet hearings only is going to feature Mr Trump and everybody he knows\nNow again you may think that's what should happen and that's all fine you're into that opinion and I'm not here to argue it one way or the other but I'm going to tell you can have a tremendous impact on the stock market because all of this revolves around confidence and it will be crushing the confidence and in fact that may be a strategic move by the people on the other\nDecide because if the economy's not doing well it's going to be a whole lot harder for the Republicans to win and twenty twenty but that's kind of the big view on all of this\nThe smaller view is that you've got very little cash left on the sidelines it's getting more expensive for people to borrow money to buy stocks and when that\nHappens people stop borrowing so much that takes away demand when you take away demand that when companies have to borrow at pay more to borrow money to buy back their own stock\nWhen mortgages go up and now housing prices have to come down to reflect the increase in mortgage rates all of a sudden the economy starts turning and it turns very quickly and again in two thousand and eight when the market crashed last forty percent of its value in a month\nIt was Thirteen Years of gains in Eighteen months\nThat is very likely in my opinion something on that magnitude is inevitable I can tell you when it's going to start but I can tell you you're seeing a lot of signs of the top right now now companies may continue to buy back their stock next year because they haven't spent all the repatriated money\nBut earnings are starting to get weaker this quarter GDP forecaster being lowered around the world\nYes you've gotten through the NAFTA deal but you still have a lot of issues with China Italy's a basket case and they're going to have big problems with the ... you and you may end up with another group wanting to Italy may want to leave the EU sometime this year\nAll of these things can take this market down very quickly and getting back to the first idea people always tell me that their investors and I would argue that they're not getting their gamblers because they don't really understand what they own why they own it they just heard it was a good company or their study says it was a good company but\nThey don't really have a plan of what happens when I'm wrong\nAnd we're going to always be wrong because these things all change do you think about ten years ago the greatest company out there to buy for the long term was was blackberries called ... back in the day\nHe was trained for a hundred and forty dollars a share it was the dominant cell phone company you can be president you didn't have a blackberry you couldn't be secretary of state unless you had Thirteen backwards I mean just for convenience but be that as it may be\nThe problem was is that apple came along with a new phone and an Android came along and all of a sudden this dominance company got crushed this long term can't lose proposition lost in that stock went from a hundred and forty bucks a share right now I think is trading around ten or eleven and it's not going to come back\nAnd this is the other thing and I'll go through this with the guys in class\nWhen stocks fall they almost never come back you know people talk about why by these you know good dividend paying stocks okay in a blue chips okay we'll forward as is still down Seventy five percent gee is down eighty percent and it keeps tanking many of the large banks are still down eighty and Ninety percent and they're not going to come back\nThat's number one we want him to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that uh you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that an philosophically how that would apply to you is that\nWhen you retire we specialize and worked with people who are retired or retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important keeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the two goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just lost your money you're you're you're done financially or have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six a core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay so that's the first thing always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrifice honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nObfuscating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is\nIt will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if for example just if you lied on your resume to get a job and you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on their resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing\nHonesty to get the growth that you want never works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty to to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we\nDisclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize

sometimes\nStudy five five and he's\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] we are as\nMoney matters with Kendall right but of course I Am your host can rape\n[noise]\nThank you Jack I have been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last\nNineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and every single one of them has had a character of its own and they've all been different and they've all been that and this year is no exception and uh so we currently work with over a thousand families\nSo [laughter]\n[noise] yeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently a barren named why you're faithful host one of the top one hundred\nFinancial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row and uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we are talking about\nOur philosophy of a of a business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business\nIs the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life and so I think that uh this week that this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with eight thousand families and if you think about how many people that is you know when you think of a family of grandparents do you have children and grandchildren and great grandchildren\nI mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that a ... grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we create it will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now\nAnd if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taken care of and so well they're down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have to build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years\nAnd I think families so to apply this to you personally families that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\n[noise] so what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients are obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do is noble\nIf we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do but in the broader context and how you would apply to in your life you know uh my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over again\nEvery time I every time with her\nOkay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song or you know ... I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you okay\nSo now you got to keep keep doing that making a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters we want anybody that comes to ah talk to us that does not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time to have\nThat person understand that every single time don't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go way\nYou take your children for granted your children will go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not and what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net is our website", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Money Matters with Ken Moraif", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "20"}
