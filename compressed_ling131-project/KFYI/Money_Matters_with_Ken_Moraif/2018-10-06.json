{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "I saw stand the other day that if you look at people even in their sixties the average person has something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere with all due respect in retirement to really get to where most people need to be you're talking millions\nWhich means most people aren't going to get where they need to be and you can still do better but you know most people are going to be in the hole on that a hundred and Seventy five not close but what's amazing about it is almost all equity in houses now part of what's driving the equity in houses is\nThe root for real estate mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again a big key and the top when you have this much margin debt\nWhat happens is is that as people borrow more and more money to buy stocks so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it\nTo you borrowed the rest of it well as their stocks go up in value you get more borrowing capacity so you don't actually have to solve the stocks so all this money gets created then that creates demand\nNow at the same time companies are buying back their own stock which is limiting supply so this pushes stock prices up and you have this ... this virtuous cycle\nAs people get more borrowing capacity that borrow more money they don't have anything else to do with the money 'cause nothing else was given a decent rate of return so they keep buying more and more stocks but\nWhat always happens in these cycles is it that when the fed starts raising interest rates then all of a sudden the margin that doesn't become as attractive as it used to be actually so I think today that if you're borrowing less than about fifty granted Schwab on margin right now it's costing you nine to ten percent\nOkay that's a big number and all of a sudden that isn't as attractive as stocks aren't going up so fast you combine that with again you know a big change in the house in ... this fall and all of a sudden social mood starts changing\nPeople aren't as optimistic there's not as much confidence it's two years of what you've just been through on the Kavanaugh hearings only is going to feature Mr Trump and everybody he knows\nNow again you may think that's what should happen and that's all fine you're into that opinion and I'm not here to argue it one way or the other but\nI'm going to tell you is going to have a tremendous impact on the stock market because all of this revolves around confidence and it will be crushing the confidence and the fact that may be a strategic move by the people on the other side\nBecause if the economy's not doing well it's going to be a whole lot harder for the Republicans to win and twenty twenty but that's kind of the big view on all of this\nThe smaller view is that you've got very little cash left on the sidelines is getting more expensive for people to borrow money to buy stocks and when that\nHappens people stop borrowing so much that takes away demand when you take away demand that when companies have to borrow a pay more to borrow money to buy back their own stock\nWhen mortgages go up and now housing prices have to come down to reflect the increase in mortgage rates all of a sudden the economy starts turning that turns very quickly and again in two thousand and eight when the market crashed it last forty percent of its value in a month\nIt was Thirteen Years of gains in Eighteen months\nThat is very likely in my opinion something on that magnitude is inevitable I can tell you when it's going to start but I can tell you you're seeing a lot of signs of the top right now now companies may continue to buy back their stock next year because they haven't spent all the repatriated money\nBut earnings are starting to get weaker this quarter GDP forecaster being lowered around the world\nYes you've gotten through the NAFTA deal but you still have a lot of issues with China Italy's a basket case and they're going to have big problems with the ... you and you may end up with another group wanting to Italy may want to leave the EU sometime this year\nAll of these things can take this market down very quickly and getting back to the first idea people always tell me that their investors and I would argue that they're not getting their gamblers because they don't really understand what they own why they own it they just heard it was a good company or their study says it was a good company but\nThey don't really have a plan of what happens when I'm wrong\nAnd we're going to always be wrong because these things all change you know we think about ten years ago the greatest company out there to buy for the long term was was blackberries called ... back in the day\nHe was trained for a hundred and forty dollars a share it was the dominant cell phone company you can be president you didn't have a blackberry you couldn't be secretary of state unless you had Thirteen blackberries I mean just for convenience but be that as it may\nThe problem was is that apple came along with a new phone and an Android came along and all the sudden this dominance company got crushed this long term can't lose proposition lost in that stock one from a hundred and forty bucks a share right now I think is trading around ten or eleven and it's not going to come back\nAnd this is the other thing and I'll go through this with guys in class\nWhen stocks fall they almost never come back you know people talk about why by these you know good dividend paying stocks okay in a blue chips okay well Ford is is still down Seventy five percent gee is down eighty percent and it keeps tanking many of the large banks are still down eighty and Ninety percent and they're not going to come back\nThat's the side of this that people never see and that's what I Will show you in class and how show you how to make money on it as well\nSo again the classroom and to be teaching as before the crash will talk about strategies for the market going up market going down how do we actually profit on these moves down you can get to free tickets and a free tablet when you come out plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt

[noise]\nProceeding has been a paint program Hi this is Ken from online training academy Phoenix in this series of spots I'm going to debunk some common market Mr Smith one we hear all these new Phoenix\nIs Fox News alert on Rogers junior and its official Brett Kavanaugh will be the next justice on the Supreme Court the Senate confirming him just one hour ago by those slim as of margins\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nDoing very on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore\nAbout ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your\nUh not too you're very ah what's the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive in but before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting jak jak as my producer extraordinary [noise]\nUm you know I I'm I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy\nAnd this puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she's like a big dog you forget but she's just a baby\nUm and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\nAnd uh so the the update 'cause people apparently are interested in this I don't know why or is that a noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pay however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she squats and boom\nGallon a pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she pays right on the patio and his colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but\nI Hope so [laughter] anyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy or the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong now the strongest some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower that\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy is strong\nAnd so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days would that realization now we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you review your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bonds even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market the difference though is that bond bear market started the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market we're falls and crashes\nIt's like this this general decline that lasts for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a ... a couple of months ago we\nReduce the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalence\nBecause what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of accounts goes up and there because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we want we want to make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates and our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not review drawn portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd there's a link on there that says meet with an advisor and if you click on

for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we are so thankful we not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family\nAnd help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stuff\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisor for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that but again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation\nWe have with our clients and even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collect it\nAnd it's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kind of things there actually eight thousand\nCombinations of that the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security\nAnd what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter] so how do you figure that at all well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you\nSo you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and I mean it's complicated you know our advisors in our farm we put a we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training\nI mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision\nBe that as it may I Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about\nAnd so one of the questions would be you know should I wait until I'm Seventy and start claim Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually\nStart when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you're going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy eight increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay\nSo it there's an incentive there to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what are we believe to be the reasons why you may want to weigh two you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to hear that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter] if you don't want it I'll take it [laughter]\nBut uh anyway yeah so if if you feel that uh you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut are there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period than we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash\nFlow we want to help you to make important decisions\nThat you need to
