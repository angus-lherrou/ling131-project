{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "And all of those kinds of things so everybody kind of benefits from you know the big lives that are told out here and again you know just on the GDP thing the country right now is sitting on Seventy one trillion dollars in debt\nA huge part of this is individuals' borrowing money to go to college to buy houses they can afford and to buy stocks and I haven't really gotten to this in the show but\nAbout three percent more than three percent of the entire US Economy has been borrowed so people can buy stock on what's called margin and the problem is is that when when that starts getting more expensive when interest rates go up people start getting what are called margin calls and they have to come up with more money\nAnd if people don't have any more money so when that starts happening they're forced to sell and and part of what I cover in classes I Will show you how much margin death or as I'll show you how much money these people don't have\nAn historically what always happens in these cycles as the fed starts raising interest rates people start backing off on their borrowing okay it affects mortgage mortgage rates go up and mortgage rates have gone from about three percent to five percent and the last year or two K. that's a huge increase\nWhen that happens housing prices have to come down because people can only afford so much house now can we lowered the standards sure we can do that for a while but eventually that catches up with us secondly what you see historical years when money starts getting more expensive people start backing off on the margin debt\nThat takes away demand for stocks cause it's taking money that was borrowed that was being used to buy stocks it's pulling that money out\nWhen you reduce demand then what happens to price will price falls and so what you tend to see historical years before price falls you'll see a fallen margin debt now we haven't seen the fall on march in debt occurring yet but interest rates are just starting to move up\nOver the last year the U.S treasury tenure rate has moved up about a third okay it's about one percent higher than it was about a year ago\nJust that's that's a big number okay even just you think about the government debt okay we were at two years ago we were running a deficit of about six hundred billion dollars a year now again that's a ridiculous numbers actually more than five trillion a year because of how we do the math but that's another show\nBut okay it was about six hundred billion officially this year it's about nine hundred and fifty seven billion that's a fifty percent plus increase in two years\nAnd then here's the killer it's not the fed raising rates a quarter percent a year it's the fact that the Federal Reserve isn't buying as many bonds as they used to what's happening is is what they did\nThat until two thousand and Thirteen they just kept buying new bonds and they brought about three and a half trillion dollars worth of bonds well starting to two thousand and thirty and they stopped buying new ones but they rolled over all the ones they always had\nSomeone that bond came do they would just buy it from the government again and that kept the government's financing costs down well last October they started what was called the rolling off balance sheet\nSo they stopped buying so many bonds and for the first three months of this they didn't buy ten billion dollars worth of bonds that essentially came off their balance sheet as they matured\nWell this October this month that number goes to fifty billion\nAnd so for the next say year and change okay\nYou're going to have about seven hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of bonds that the fed owns that they're not going to re by\nIf you had your increase in your debt ... your deficit by fifty percent three hundred and some billion and now you have another what's just say for a year you've got six hundred billion in bonds that the fed currently owns that they're not really buying\nThat is a trillion dollars worth of bonds that you have to find a buyer for and if you haven't noticed we're not everybody's best friend in this world it's China's not going to step in and help us with that Russia is not going to step in and help us with that and by the way everybody else's broke anyway\nSo who's going to buy all those bonds to yield two and a half percent\nWhile the short answer is no one\nSo if you now have this huge supply a bond you have to sell and there's not a big increase in demand what happens is the price of oil price has to go down which means that yields go up\nSo now all of a sudden it's more expensive for companies to borrow money so they can't buy back as much Stockton there have been the biggest buyers of stocks out there\nIt's more expensive for people to buy stock on march in housing prices fall\nThe government budget gets even more out of whack which means or even farther behind on the debt side which means you're gonna have to issue more bonds and then all of this is going from a virtuous cycle where the lower rates made mortgages cheaper mate stocks cheaper made the government budget affordable\nTo where now it's unwinding is turning the other direction\nHow long will it take to play out I don't have a clue and neither does anybody else but this\nHaving to sell the new bonds is going to be a as Joe Biden would put it this is a big deal okay so we want to make sure that we're prepared so again the class I'm teaching is before the crash profit and protection strategies for any market\nThis is not a gloom and doom presentation this is the facts this is where we are in this market here where the valuations are\nThe market may still go higher that's always possible we can still make money with these strategies in that market but by the\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself overtime time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired are retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten tell we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show is among where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect which you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten ... so we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening talking about you I'm I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy or she had this submissive ... thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a ... right there she just squats and peas and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email to ... we had the best\nI can tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura [noise] uh she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone number as you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time to sweet but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's OK\nAnyway oh let's talk about is this is Alvin it ate all over again okay so you know I Want to go back to a you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October issue and all that and at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker\nA there was a inflation was picking up the economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but they were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically and at that\nTime people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before I finally a sell off a cliff so\nIs this like that I'm no\nIn my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape\nSo we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it well basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raised interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up\nIf interest rates go up people buy fewer houses your cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week is the beginning of a new bear market recession all that kind of stuff\nBut you know what it does do in my view it should be a wakeup call to you because did you know did you see how fast it fell I mean it was like what eleven hundred points and two days I mean that's fast the\nMarket when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly\nMean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like it did in Y. two K. or and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and your contemplating your retirement or you are retired we want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the

there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning and uh the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so\nLet's talk about Social Security and one of the areas\nThe probably the most important of decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is when do you apply for benefits\nOkay and it's not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six or sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two and Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits\nIf the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start\nOkay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time you start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why would you take when you're sixty two\n[noise] the problem is that most people will not outlive will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is is the life expectancy so you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives their own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty\nYou know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you\nKnow we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be so the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity and by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay does a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same okay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired\nAre retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring sooner\nThan we are here for\nYou and our goal is to help more people in retirement than anybody else that's what we want to do [laughter]\nSo uh if you go to our website
