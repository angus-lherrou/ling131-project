{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "There's a tremendous amount of resources that way but again that's available in every online trading academy campus around the world\nBut what we're we're focused on is the students' students' support peace\nThe ability for you to come in literally seven days a week to come in at night and sit down with someone who's a student who's been through this process has been successful who can talk to about\nPutting together a trade plant and reviewing your trade plant and reviewing your trades against your trade plant who could help motivate you who can keep you on the right track who can keep moving forward we have a tremendous amount of resources available for that\nBecause it's the key to the whole thing you can't learn how to do this out of a book you can't learn this from CDs could you learn magical indicators sure\nBut then I'm going to ask you how do you know which is a hundred and fifty indicators to use on any given trade how do you know which of the infinite available parameters you should do this and this given trade\nAnd the short answer is you don't\nThe indicators work until they don't and the reality is these things generally or have about fifty percent or less probability rating so how is that going to be the foundation of a successful set of strategies especially when most of them have terrible if any risk management which again from a knowledge perspective is key\nWe can help motivate you we can keep you on the right path\nAnd that is critically important when I started learning to trade I went through a lot of hotel seminars and sometimes the information was okay a lot of times it was drunk a lot of times it's hard to tell the difference\nBut when you left there then you look at something and say but it's this one of these were this one of those and there wasn't anyone to ask\nAgain we have an entire part of our staff\nThat all they do is work with students they have no sales responsibilities they have no you know quotas targets anything else\nThey are they're simply to ensure your success\nAnd if you go back to why do we have five stars out of five stars of the better Business Bureau why do we have four point nine to five stars on Google Plus why do we have out of the you know all of our students when do surveys why is it that Ninety seven point seven two percent of Phoenix students\nRate at their experience with us either four or five stars\nAgain we don't pay for reviews we don't have a bad reputation management firm we don't give people discounts when they write nice things about us\nWhat we do is we do what we say we're going to do one of things I always say to people is\nBecause we are local because we have a campus in Scottsdale you know where to find us we're accountable to you in a way that nobody else is if we say we're going to do something we're going to do it I grew up in a world that if you told someone you are going to do something and you didn't do it\nThey would show up at your house and beat you until you get that was the world I grew up in\nIf you don't come and physically beat us again I expect you to say nasty things about us online\nAnd the reason that we don't have that is because we do do what we say we're going to do now we also are very direct with you you got to do your part okay if you don't follow through if you're not disciplined if you're not motivated if you can't focus and and\nAnd and put together a trade playing again with our help will he be tremendous help in that and you're with all due respect you are going to need that help because there's a lot more to those trade plans on what people realize\nBut you've got to get out from you know in front of the TV and sit down and do this and part of this becomes\nJust first understanding are you serious about achieving your financial goals what are they\nMost people's financial goals consistent roughly of I Want to be comfortable in retirement I Want to be financially secure well what does that mean if you don't put a number to to ask how old are you know if you are on track for it and so we work with you on ideas like that as well\nAnd and it all comes down to how serious argue about achieving your financial goals\nAnd the sad fact is the vast majority of people aren't sure is that all\nThe reason that most people don't achieve their financial goals is it never really set them\nAnd then they never actually do what's required to meet them\nAnd do you do is throw said most men lead lives of quiet desperation\nAt some point in their lives people just kind of get focused on making it to the finish line and they're trying to survive and and they exist instead of to live\nAnd the markets are a great opportunity to achieve financial goals to actually live but they're not the only alternative you may decide on real estate you may decide to own your own business\nBut every one of these things is going to require some commitment on your part some effort on your part\nIf you actually want to succeed\nAnd because of the people we haven't students support we can sit down with you and talk to you about your goals we can put together a plan of how you can achieve those goals\nWe again put on hold you accountable to that plan we can hold you accountable to are you taking the trades you said you would take are you getting off track and that is why we continue to win the award again the brand champion awarded online trading academy which to me is the key word because what it means is we are focused on the students' first and foremost\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent and Y. two K.\nIt went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent so I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I'll kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money\nAt age sixty or at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five\nAnd a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter] so so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... show that is chock full of great in though right\nAnd that's how most cells would just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to of course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally a that's you know that's a part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your agreed on washed undeserving heirs and so we're going to talk about paying for college and not having\nTo pay a gift tax okay because the IRS\n[noise] yeah those guys they want the tax gifts and college in most cases has more is is is expensive and you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a\nWe think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become solid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last\nSix years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter] and uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at a ... in in Plano in North Dallas\nAnd uh we raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nReally really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven\nUm you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have the cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve will be have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens\nIs that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven or strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and weren't\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent and do that in the lab and so that's not too bad but that the U.S and pay\n'em but they did as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out and uh those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't\nAnd the market to rebound quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere\nYou know it was the news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible and so I was very feeling that I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline\nOf an in the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers that looked pretty good you got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we are close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course are so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right or it's right anyway or whatever\nPoint being ladies and gentlemen is that if you are retired or retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is the market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I've changed my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we could see the market go down to another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here\nAnd are you going to stay in for that you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it okay I don't want you to get caught in this\nAnd so here's what you do you go to our website it's money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd click on a lake that says meet with an advisor or register for seminar

wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same idea that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients [noise] ... do\nAnd uh you know we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning and us so we we primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon\nAnd we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored and in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth

those of you who are not yeah there you go as well kiss\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd when you're there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so go their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is a segment of show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security uh journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase\nSo the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five but I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security\nBut not the other way around okay if you fall for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and his eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply is now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about it six months that age eighty um with all the delay credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah OK soak in a client's kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so\nBut ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter] that's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re filed okay so there's no need to go down and asked\nThe local Social Security administration worker okay you just file essay form five Twenty one so so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re filed later All right so uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nOr whatever you have this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do you have enough money to retire on we call that a magic number we want to show you how to calculate that number we we also want to talk about what our\nFive strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes during your retirement we're going to talk about how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four O. one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that IRS guy [laughter]\nI Can't blame her or the IRS once the tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we want to [noise] I agree [laughter] and you know we want to show you how to beat that if it\nIs a tall possible we want to talk about diversification or how much risk should you take with your portfolio we have a way of
