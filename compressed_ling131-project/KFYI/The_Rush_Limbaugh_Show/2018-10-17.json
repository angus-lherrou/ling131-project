P. S. just plain stupid game and that it should hurt more be painful [laughter] a Florida here we go yeah yeah only ready you look at a writer you my three and you're only getting a Florida sharpening [laughter] so it might have been reading Florida that's already [laughter]\nA Florida borrowers have been arrested during a sex sting operation last weekend while being arrested the man told the cops that he was just blank for\nThere to shaver [noise] the barber [noise]\nIt was just showing up to see a police sting operation first hand [laughter] that's really an [laughter] it's hard to WDC only came to the meeting place because he sees because he believed it was an undercover sting operation and that would be cool to see in action [noise]\nMario ... showed up wearing a T shirt that read I Would cut all use so much harder [noise]\nThat is a creepy because that's Florida sure doesn't make you guilty [noise] know showing up to\nSure the\nTo catch a creditor show yeah one of my favorite show what was funny about it is the suspect started catch it on that maybe it was a sting operation so one guy wrote a note that he never intended to do anything and kept it in his pocket except he brought the beer and condoms he's from just to pay it wasn't on the air you know get all of his base cover last of both worlds [laughter]\nI was that was my guilty pleasure I loved that show I loved watching to cancel it because all those cases were getting thrown out because we don't we take a seat\nYou knew there was fresh baked cookies already done [laughter]\nI have a cookie I'm just going to change my clothes off or you're in a very exactly [laughter]\nI don't absolutely nothing wrong if I Walk into a panda express them see him here lies I was so horrified because they did a sting operation in my home town and I'm going to ...\nI actually knew the house that they were doing it I don't know exactly where that houses and so I kept watching for someone I knew that God there was nobody I knew none of the cops not know what I didn't know anybody it was it was great one of Spain's most wanted man has finally been captured Francisco at home\nSo you didn't give them the time of day and when he did it was looking down his nose but they didn't care because Obama was hip they didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one Obama\nWas enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well\nYeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story\nI said you mean about the show ... he said yeah I said well what do you mean you blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story or having evidence of how ... died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation in murder\nBecause it is apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at elements\nProving their case but then when certainly said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point\nBut there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible there is no way that democracy show he's watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so unless ... had entered the password for the consulate wife my network on his watch which I Know he didn't do\nBecause most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even who handle watched don't even know that watch will work on why five most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a why finding work like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not\nClose together\nBut only if you have answered that why ... works password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I myself didn't Warren you had to do this until a couple of years after I got my first one I mean that's how obscure a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just\nBlew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's mostly they they say the show was recorded the events of after recorded on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] neither headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating blue wave\nIncluding none other than the door yeah I'm a\nDemocrat National Committee cheating and electric and bringing\nDown to Brazil who strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise]\nThat's right so see and I got rid of Fox willingly open an arm and a lady had done it Brazil on and hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that is well\nYou know twenty days is a long time in ...\nBill and I don't scramble my ... before my chickens hatch\nI said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\nIdled scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch\nShe said naming\nThere's so much she left it couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact\nOf the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although there is even more survey data now that the cabinet story was a one way benefits to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd at the cabin on a scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\n\nA media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren folk honest thing blows up to the point they can't\nContinue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned them shocked where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what but rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nYou think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here started campaigning as if this blue wave weren't a deadlock\nIf the blue wave or why are you still hear me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a ... couple of stories Democrats said where's Obama they're asking where's Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find Obama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign and the situation because the blue wave is not a walk and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have a coat tails\nIt's during the Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in the right he campaigned for Hillary\nTwo thousand sixteen remember how he did it do you want\nA third term of mud ... if you want me to sleep continue you know do you vote for Hillary at what happened did and all this\nTrump was the match it late at night Hillary Rodham running them and so\nHe's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two or three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\nSo the a P pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why Trump is in the media all\nDay it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they tell about it\n\nHere's how the story begins facing the prospect of rules electoral defeat in congressional elections president\nDonald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November ... wide ranging and is there any other kinds of interviews and wide ranging\nYou think that's\nNot a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those you know they're always a wide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismissed suggestions\nThat he might take responsibility as his predecessor did for midterm losses or view of the outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of in fact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nAnd I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline\nTrump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses house ready [noise] three to one\nA beat reporter okay so my question is if Republicans want to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no I think I'm helping\nPeople look I'm forty\nEight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those forty eight hours you know where people that had no chance in some cases\nWe look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor many many racist and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say\nThat in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nWell some of the people live indoors to have gone up forty and fifty points just on the endorsement in nowhere in that statement does Donald Trump say\nSegment and Barney set of President Trump does anybody ever say to you or you're doing an awful lot of media uh anybody complaining during too much media deal like it\nLike it I like getting the point across I've heard you say many times that the economy isn't covered properly and it's not that the economy's not covered properly by these so called mainstream media and it isn't ah we went up almost six hundred points yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere in\nThe economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have if they do not treat us fairly and therefore if I Do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk of myself\nAnd what about the your tweets and so for these people that say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting oh\nAnd I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did have some way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nBut some of them but there's so much mass information being put out that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour [noise] I don't go to wait and I thought social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest economy and the history of our country and it's not being reported\nOr you go it's that simple he's the only way he get his message out he's not going to stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated them into CNN media media whatever guys\nTo merge talking residents just still much media there's too much he's gotta he's gotta stop point loading the country and so they're so frustrated they can't stop it [noise]\n[noise] there's\nEvidence from the KFYI newsroom red fall turkey claims to have audio and video of journalists being murdered at\nThis added consulate in Istanbul and President Trump says the U.S is interesting\nI Want to find out what happened where is this fall and we will probably know that by the end of the way for my ... coming back we're going to belong to off\nJamal to show he disappeared after entering the Saudi ... about two weeks ago\nThe U.S Supreme Court will hear a case that could ultimately affect free speech rights on social media platforms the Manhattan community access corporation is being sued by two producers who claim a public access cable channel censor them for their political views\nThey claim that the channel is a public forum protected by the first amendment even though it's operated by a private company the outcome of the case could affect the ability of social media companies to suspend accounts or control content on their platforms\nHere in Arizona former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio assuming the New York times the federal law suit accuses the paper of damaging his chances for a Senate seat in twenty twenty\nAt issue is an opinion piece published the day after our pile lost twenty Eighteen Republican primary for Arizona Senate seat\nThe suit accuses

fifty nine tomorrow in other winners sunny and Seventy nine and friday sunshine\nAnd eighty four for the Fox and whether it's ... right now it's sixty nine in Phoenix your next news at eleven a new stock five fifty KFYI available anytime on our free I heart radio F [noise]\nMichael Jackson as a buffer rotation\nBlood on the dance floor [noise] with proper fall of obviously the league [noise]\nRight to have you ever hear of telephone number eight hundred to eight to ... a pill hey look at this this headline from ... knows Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump pro ... sources say\nDo they think that we are idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces in and sit by and the pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything if has got to be in tents\nEverything has blown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on them Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on them\nEvery attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought all\nAlong the mother is gonna get the goods on how Trump's Foley election by shooting including what the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Mahler is not going to deliver a key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with all the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the\nGame here but they're there and look to take the reins\nPsychologically screwed up base\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been\nThey've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished after the terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural India is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will\nHe held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the latter is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies and the drive by media\nRather than break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start\nTalking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe sources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don Mueller's wrap it up while I was a big garden smaller is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking about before the midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they are hoping that the great on washed out there the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when lower it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\n\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein who is\nTechnically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not that it is made public certainly the Democrats do when the house\nThey're going to insist that Muller not conclude the investing particularly if he hasn't found any collusion of the Democrats win the house they're going to tell them that we got time man we got all the time in the world keep digging\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again during the campaign OK okay\nOr the campaign one regents that I'd\nBe during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one reason was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat by mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time and the press conference ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation and he should he should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit for the country doing well in that shocks right\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since regular I've ever seen how we can take bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really you you made it sound like your frustration is with from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your\nAudience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people in the same boat who were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\n... it's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea I hear it newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if they raised\nTheir but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a wage is going up what am I ever seen anything\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with the lizards Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say you\nShould probably be met more informed used on five fifty KFYI [noise]\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance both were larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information them\nAnd it's amazing how honest if is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout to compete in newspapers one of them's being one of them small one of them is very serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than\n... trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth\nBut you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the big people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously have to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and there's the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something air mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ...\nCall 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they ... if they run a profile or or on a piece on somebody that can be\nMade to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no one's about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watch this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is\nOne of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the waging guides\nUs journalist is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just that they're that they have some kind of a relationship and not for it to me like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you want to ...

now and it would be used to\nThat extent it just isn't gonna jibe with reality\nAnd it's it's it wouldn't be I don't think nearly as effective as something as personal but I think you have to you have to look at the history of these October surprises\nThey've tried October surprise in October they've tried them in September they've thrown everything they've got at Trump including during the

this happened none of it all Trump there was remind everybody of this or actually inform him because the drive buys had not\nAnd that then caused a meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of ...\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer immediate not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap ad reports\nOver and over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo my career he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonator he's simply\nReminded everybody in real world language that she had no evidence and it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake\nOnce Trump did that and caused the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThen\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford van is she had no evidence there was nothing to support\nPeople with common sense there was nothing just you believer yeah the basis of what well it says is that what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said that we're there to say they weren't\n... she became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point Kevin all came in and of course his his re testimony is reappear\nThis was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum on ... drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels and the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform when I'm appalled she was slithering around the drive by his were they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels me came a cause ... even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn lawyer who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to a news story that the drive by is we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had\nBeen found guilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the ... the prostitute porn star is paying\nTrump who among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it ignoring\nThat the stripper porn star and been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees\nBut when Trump called her horse face in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so

tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader plus year Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed parking was it was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policy is highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been a Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nTrump with a GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does\nI have to think that the drive buys are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher hears that story certainly you didn't believe it
