newsroom good morning I'm read Paul President Trump says the FBI should\nWith us in may call extending new NAFTA deal to Congress so\nWe're renegotiating NAFTA Canada Canada which said they want to know part of it they asked in the last moment hey don't forget us can we be why did this to\nPrompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaning into terrorist jumps in hell no I mean the end the tariffs if the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\n\nRemember how to drive by and the Democrats than the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was gonna provoke which I ... couldn't possibly be good at it might mean the end of whatever range or making what the North Korea and\nIt might destroy existing good relations with the dry comes up up breaking news China to cut import tariffs on wide range of products China\nBut ... will cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including ... steel products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the ... finance ministry yesterday\nThe checkouts have pledged to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tensions with those some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri\nMary American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do and it's not done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs lost about twenty five percent of our on our jobs even more than that [noise] throughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or you know and extended\nThe statements\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nA known to understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how ... works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the superpower in the world where the richest we can afford to take an insurance now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason that we should have our back pockets picket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we shouldn't feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft but more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs in their careers\n\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about any kind of run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has the chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened to why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as a noun Singh is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking about got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us [noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... or in the\nRespect of authors it's up to us just show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump just turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOverseer will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them to do business with us\nAnd I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody\nIt's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come down and I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves\nAnd our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize we really we really happened is you know you can see evidence and scientists on our own culture of the achieved any accomplished somehow people need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of new definition of humility a rather than having used as a teachable moment if something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making their country great we want every country putting our country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for\nEverybody to do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nOr don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget it was barrage Hussein ... who said none of this could be done\nThe remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore essentially we're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore\nNow just the opposite going to be a manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of unfair trade issues\nSo there you have it it's um it's not a sexy subject NAFTA never was I mean it was in command and a lot of attention a it was very controversial when it was ratified in the in the early in the mid Nineteen nineties\nBut in terms of being a subject that if if cable news announcer gonna do it two or three panels tonight on NAFTA trade deal and not going to have a lot of people tuned in\nIt's just the way of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden of the day that people get its importance in terms of its important as an election issue it's crucial\nIt is um I wouldn't say crucial but it's it's very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters stick with me I told you I was going to do this I told you it could be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject of World Trade don't doubt me\nAnd in that sense it's a confidence inspiring that Trump left alone in the oval office free and clear to be who he is will man ... bunch of great things happening for the country and this can be part led into any number of\nThe president calling the

the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a nose ring\nOr is it fair inserts button light and\nIt became obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who was seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and I was all the possibilities were mentioned she eventually

talk station is used dogs five fifty KFYI Phoenix Jay y o da de do Phoenix and I are trained goes [noise]\n\nThere's even a little story that's developed about the uh her use a safe way\nThat she shopped in safe way a lot and that was new and the reason this the theory behind that is\nMark judge wrote a book as part of his therapy for alcohol and drug abuse he was told to write a book it was\nIt was supposed to be a fictional book it was a it was a it was a an aide to attempt to help him through his\nProblems it was not a memoir\nAnd in this book it talks about safe way a lot and he works there didn't work there so she automatically places herself but at Safeway where he is\nRachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here I I it it is devastating be inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she set in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea that she was afraid to fly and yet here she is vacationing all over the world how did she get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California\nWe learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans are not demanding an investigation Tom ... says we're gonna investigate Feinstein were given my best to get this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she is the last\n\nShe's not the least credible witness it all of this\nAnd yet there she is automatically said to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what had been all of\nThose years ago you could say yeah because she really knew how to make it look\nLike that I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus groups I think it's scripted\nAnd I just I'm because none of this past is any kind of a smell test well anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered\nVoters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independents with only forty five percent\nRepublicans who are in a smart ones\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine old at\nThe poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nWhat the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration as the standard\nFor tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the borders are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jumped from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent in a hypothetical question if the FBI\nAfter a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got Coney entering the picture\nNow we've got a call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this was a jet Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nAnything no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking on that uh there's no better way to um motivate each group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm\nOf that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last June twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in midterms are going to they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again for Trump and twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend\nOn Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to ... political corresponded David Brody about all this\nAnd she says all we know the Democrats all ready men really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized naked get\nBut I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp or my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the horrible evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nI think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow like you you can't blame David Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after they've gone viral all over the\nDrive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me you're predicting Republican\nDo they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are guaranteed to lose ... capital not confirmed that prediction was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that predicts shouldn't set it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want\nTo Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard and Andrew anger\nAbout

actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin all things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls are polls there aren't very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election [noise] they were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondents said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what I'd change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in this law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ...\nThis whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House I'm trying to limit the FBI ice go because you see there are things to find the Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump for his I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank you Mr suffered needs to go to waste is going to go to waste so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it will just tell ya if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\n\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be ranked and they're going to demand even more\nTime to fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels I went to the response as well they found nothing in a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um [noise]\nAudio soundbite number thirty reporter about judge Kavanaugh there are

Drudge Report during the break at\nWhat am I see what is the lead a headline limit drudgery of all let me read it to your White House expands\nFBI ... so what the hell is that so I clicked on the link here's what it is [noise]\nRight here at my formerly Nick at the same fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one necessary for Kevin inquiry this is because of what they claim Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys don't do that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations ... not that's fake news so then they've got it on record Trump not limiting investment which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessarily and rice on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats have submitted a list of twenty four people they want the FBI\nTo talk to this after Fox News had an earlier today was the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all\nThis is is delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nIf somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides your needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much\nYou can do with the woman who doesn't remember where or when whatever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she sounds were their claim they weren't\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it it needs to be spoken for\n\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything on my Bob Mueller face stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of bread capital somebody needs to speak up for him\nSomebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\n\nBut that's not happening somehow weren't letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and or incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible Kavanaugh is not\nSomebody look we had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack them in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up but they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it either no such thing\nBut he sure fell for a debate I Am not limiting anything it's totally FBI to take us wherever it takes them promptly Democrats while you're Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI say there's there's some people in my town here are really really screw on the porch and I need
