I Can't I got an email from a friend of mine last night\nWho just beside themselves over the fact that Republicans might lose the house he is convinced this guy's a former New York liberal by the way\nHe reformed about Twenty years ago he can't he can't\nHe's having trouble dealing with the possibility that the Democrats might win the house he's having trouble dealing with the fact that the majority the American people might want\nThat I understand I agree with him completely\nDoesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves in the cabinet situation\nBut that's just the latest\nThe Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system\nTo fix whatever problems they have the the or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument of the purpose of government\nIt really is\nIs you take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependence grown up in a mass thinking the government is the solution and the solution is not really a solution\nThe solution at the Democratic voters want is punishment for people they think are responsible for the misery of marijuana ... why would we want that\nTo try amp\nWell we don't but in the in the in the mission to bring that about here comes this ... story and as far as the drive by shooting concerned it's an open opportunity the blasts\nTheme Trump to damage Trump the ultimate aim is to get Trump to cave in a band in Saudi Arabia\nNot it's it's not that the drive by have anything on that Saudi Arabia is just to get Trump the cave period just just just to prove that they can manipulate intimidate Trump into going against his instincts\nThey've been trying to do that since the campaign they have failed practically every effort they've made their die\nTo be able to say they pressure Trump into doing something you didn't want to do because he's afraid of them\nAnd they think they're getting close when Trump's out there saying yeah it looks like a show ... died looks like it's a pretty good rep because she'll be\nThey think they're getting close and they're all jammed up on their own tree and they're all getting more jazz\n[noise] for this that's why we tells you hook the show is not because anybody thinks he deserves to die but the media never tells you the truth about anything\nNot anymore not work concerns Trump how many of you think let me just ask you a question remembered this faceless nameless on non ... op ed\nThat ran in the New York times supposedly written by somebody in the Trump inner circle in the west wing talking about how bad it is in there how dangerous lead childish an immature\nTrump is how unprepared how ill equipped\nHow you competed how\nAt risk we all are but then we were assured by whoever wrote this thing don't worry\nThere are adults like us that are protecting this country from President Trump and you can count on us to commit well everybody who is this who wrote this and they began circulating names do you notice we don't have an identity yet\n\nNot possible not possible that whoever wrote this has not been out after all this many weeks not possible not possible that the person who wrote it\nHas an out of him or herself for the fame alone for the media accolades alone another thing why hasn't been forgotten\nI mean it's still a pretty damn big deal that there's that kind of a traitor inside the west wing why is it been forgotten because it didn't work that's why they're on the other things have you noticed there's no news about Russian collusion\nYou notice that why is that 'cause it's not a big\nDeal to people getting ready to vote it's not an issue on which people's votes will turn that's why the media dropped it\nThey try to make it the issue they did everything they could to make Russian collusion and Trump did it the issue for two and a half years here we are already in the mid terms or just a little over two weeks away not worried about other than this Mahler report supposedly being out there\nTheir religion whatever Democratic Party is helpful in making all these people believe they are justified in thinking\nThat life is miserable because of all these horrible other people what they've done to them and then the Democratic party let us fix it for you we'll become your champions will punish these people for you and they\nDemocratic voter basically yeah yeah yeah yeah now what you need to do is examine every Democrat constituency group that they've been representing the last take your ... ten years twenty fifty and ask yourself if any of the people in those groups\nHave become happy\nHave had their issues addressed and fixed or are they as miserable as they've always been are they as angry as they've always been if not more so are they still complaining today about things they were complaining about injustice discrimination a mistreatment\nThat they've been complaining about fifty years what have the Democratic party done to fix any of this\n\nAnswer is nothing although the Democratic party has done it's best to punish\nPeople who are not Democrats or below sea has recently suggested that there's more of that on tap if the Democrats will people that don't vote for him don't go along with them are going to suffer the consequences she said but the Democrats have tried to punish all these people\nBut it is not made their voters any happier there isn't any happiness\nOn the left you can't find any there is no laughter there's no enjoyment that why don't we want them winning\n[noise] removing\nIce agents from Pima County jails from the KFYI newsroom\nI'm Greg fall Sima county sheriff

tonight beginning at six thirty five fifty KFYI\nYes right that's right the course of course we're back\nOpen line friday Rush Limbaugh to Springfield, Illinois Todd\nThank you sir Hi\nRochelle are you today sir no good really good what do\nYou remember when you have to fix cell phones up front because they cost so much do you\nUh when I used to take cell phones or ... what do you mean\nYou would you would put them at the top of the line because it costs so much for oh yeah oh yeah we\nThat's right because we so we the eight hundred number didn't apply their cell phones cellphone callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way and I are way back ... back you go\nI I've been way back before that even so uh but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one thing that the Democrats won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done this at this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nThat the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't judge don't call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon Trump do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nYou know I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that if he wants to do their\nNext year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say these are smarter than I Am\nA maybe but but I uh [noise]\nThey they said that your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding was known with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump has a bit of a wall Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nI don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is\nElse do they got\nWell they've got ... behavior a\nLunatic and saying range\nRight but I mean on on\nThey got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh\nWell that's exactly right and right\nThere that's for and the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want if not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even start so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm like before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that ball\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment\nThe swamp on that they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he's a he's come through and he's twisted um er into doing what he wants\nOut and many of the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that\nTrump was not to be ongoing or a before now I I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise]\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around palm pay or is there a ... left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince either floated may call\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message ... talk\nBecause the\nClimate roast turkey yet Recep Tayyip Erdogan he is not one of these guys that wants western influence as we look on wait long haired have to take a break but that's the answer\nTo your what he's he's so many ways ... be Mitt work\nI informed used tone five fifty KFYI [noise]\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women are protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends at Mahendra are holding their fifth annual\nMilitary salute give away the winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicles that's right a brand new read my hindrance retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my handwritten you could be next\nTo nominate somebody who is active duty or a veteran of the U.S military and to get official rules\nIs it Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for the Mahendra military salute give away thanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test driving the hindered today at him in Des equipment Inc in Coolidge in Maricopa or visit M.

I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures so that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio sound as if you're on hold if you're on the phones be patient were coming through U. L. quick oh this is the sound\nBite the hand of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen and then I'm going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans and Democrats really blew them\nBut there are four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been right\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectively like this process if I put on the spot for addiction but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that by that by\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a an savannah is Julie ... cohost out there talking to fame ... Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment\nSanta's deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front the half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nWhere you are not buying into this scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't tell those but I Do I mean I run a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those in the open seat has another twenty five to thirty that are our seats that are in play was only about two or three Democrats in certain places totally on defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through that I see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is walk a stuff and to me this is totally abs and are\nThere any any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and\nI Know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite I'm just suspicious\nOf of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired out\nCome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty eight I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election as your thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama's there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party but\nThen I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to do with things that are not on any national radar well not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them [noise]\nBut anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that many people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage an anger there promoting insanity and the lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats has reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on ballots Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no way that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think that they're coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the fat edgy\nTend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing\nGetting ready to rally friendly KFYI newsroom ... the president\nIs in the valley he started his

residents coast to coast we're going to Dover\nNew Hampshire and this is George welcome it's great to have you with us George how're you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call um I was calling I just wanted to make a show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought was was just great it was probably one that shows that you ever hacked and we're really simple\nAnd you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business here you know small businesses and just talk about\nHow they're doing you know when when they are and\nSo yeah yeah you don't you don't want that was you know you you what you remember\nThere was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off executives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar people and not blue collar people [laughter]\nAnd so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and ask what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity\nI'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were they were all amazingly\nUpbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now and it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business\nSo I remember I remember it well because there was work it was in January one or ... or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other three day\nThings that are right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people the people want to buy 'em\nWell don't don't were downplayed a Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something do you think that people need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe\nIt is that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I work a lot of hours and I'm I'm I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see it\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone\nWell okay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not\nThat week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt\nSo I can take any kind of criticism for anyone and not take it personally so don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thank you this is Lloyd in in in\n... mosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi how're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain it's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point is his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting a member of these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen needs done too much into a little time\nOh I don't either get on the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is\nUh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall but his point was how many continuing\nResolutions of we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money
