herself a proud of socialist endorsed by the Communist Party all those things are true of pierced in cinema\nThe bashing that she did Netroots Nation saying that if the quote is correct that the states are the laboratory of democracy than her state Arizona is the meth lab of democracy\nShe said\nThat in twenty ten and twenty eleven she called anybody on the right side of the aisle crazy Tea Party Republicans to her were an evil name she called all Republicans evil they're not Tea Party there nothing different there all the same they're all Republicans\nWould then be fair and I think it's a fair question if here since ... says that whether you call it All right or whatever you want to call Republicans on the scale of moderate to conservative\nIf they're all the same and need to go why isn't it fair for us to say well then miss them send them a fair is fair what is the difference there is no difference between a moderate Democrat a progressive Democrat and have a democratic\nSocialist you're all the same let's make our choice then choose who is going to represent us in the United States Senate\nHouse races are immensely important no one's talking about the Greg Stanton steep for our race enough\nDr Ferrari please look him up had your friends will came up if you live in that district\nHere's a good man served his country honorably chose to go forward to a forward operating base changed the way army and military surgeons do battlefield surgery actually saving limbs in lives and he volunteered to go forward and do that\nGreg Stanton doesn't want you to look at his record in what he's done in the last ten years look what he did in the six years when he was the mayor of Phoenix\nHe doesn't want you to look at the record in what happened he wants to say look at the great things Phoenix did and I'm proud of my record no you're not talking about your record Mr Stanton\nYou're not talking about how much money the city of Phoenix lost and that Sheraton Hotel you're not talking about the money lost on golf courses you're not talking about what's happening when you kick the can down the road on what needs to happen with pensions you don't want anyone to look at that\nAnd if anybody doesn't believe because Greg Stanton refused to answer the question that Greg Stanton had a vote he wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the house you'll do it in a nanosecond but he refused to answer that question because he knew saying that was going to show himself too liberal for the district ...\nBut then you've got Dr Ferraro who is begging people to look at who using what he has to offer\nWhat a dichotomy one guy that wants you to just to see the face he puts on a postcard and the other one is begging you to meet him and take a look at his record\nOkay so\nThe point is this guy does he mean nobody's talking but he goes to the next this database it he figures oh Rush Limbaugh those are leaving climate change do people over north but\nJust rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy [noise] but because while this guy is jumping all in my chili\nListened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans now do you think these\nClowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely deranged like this you know they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know the climate change man made climate change is a hoax\nAre somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because\nThey elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written\nBy this guy was published in the guardian and not some obscure little rag or penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching at ease engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit ... people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michaels in tends to be on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claim that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's how one or the other states like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote pointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio and his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office\nThat more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction ... so\nThis clown who is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally this one is what he said in an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised\nAs Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the ...\n\nI mean this [laughter] if if it if it weren't so irresponsible that would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAt what Kanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're an African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you now do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nAs Democrats they would be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and so whatever people out there saying well he wanted the hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents\nBelieve would have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service\nTo downplay the warnings well I didn't want to mention that but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out\nThere talking made me alone attacks on the Internet who are claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was hearing that hurricane Bush himself the president was there in a hurry and and what this guy is professor at the University of St Thomas is no different\nBy claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the redneck Riviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida blow both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we look at these events are these people do as one off political events\nSome of these people who had been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back they didn't have much to begin with\nI mean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives\nOr it is it's just heartbreaking to see what happens and the only upside as it was not\nYou know a densely populated area but that doesn't change\nThe impact on the people who live there and yeah there were some who didn't evacuated and they made up their minds themselves the media found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like every hurricane has\nThose people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious\nTo hear how devastating and how big it how\nRock is the storm storms I Want to see it and they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you\n[noise] takes all kinds of people but this one I when I saw this today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see\nIf we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump would stop ... stop making fun of the UN's inter plant mental whatever it is on climate change\nThen the hurricanes and get their message in hurricanes or go somewhere else they're hurricanes wouldn't get so strong but the hurricanes no hurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters who is therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out and these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nHow absurd how do pending how\nAuthor leap politically partisan by the way it was it was getting ... book on it like clockwork just\nToday here come more intense report suddenly UN's inter governmental panel on climate change\nWe've only got eleven years this is it folks we've\nOnly got eagle eleven years to get that Celsius temperature increase now no one and a half degree [noise] if we're not able to keep them below two degrees Celsius in the next ten years we're all what toast\nAnd this is the UN's this was ... they alone may have given us ten year warnings three times and you add in Al Gore in ... dancing in all the other two disparate\nKooky environmental groups and the numbers of people in times warning us we only had ten years couldn't be more than we can count\nThe reason they're doing it is because they realize there's always going to be a group of news consumers that have never heard it\nThe left recycles all of their greatest hits it's like\nThe Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings HBO made sure to do a movie about it that ran just last year or the year before I forget which\nThat all happened back in Nineteen Ninety\nAbout twenty eight years ago so that's a whole generation that's grown up and had no idea about it so the left has to do a movie the less the current generation no how outrageous and isn't it interesting the timing\nShort years after just a few short months after the HBO movie on Clarence Thomas Anita Hill here comes Dr balls e Ford with Brett Kavanaugh\nThey leave nothing to chance they control the media and they plant things and then they revived for them to make sure that a new groups of people audiences based on generations and maturity always get the leftist

[noise] but she put it up and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true\nAnd it it's\nFairly common that these people on the left engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump ... the Democrats blue wave\nIs drying up oh is that would be a disappointment\nDon't God you're elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty Eighteen mid terms\nStill point do a good a great night for Democrats there the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTune generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely tilt Democrat and it's in line with the twenty tend to Republican numbers around now\nYet yet we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this\nGigantic wave would if you go race by race if you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asked well how can this ... this disparity be how can you have a generic ballot that shows a Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must be in the generic ballot doesn't mean much ...\nHow could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people among three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\n\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning\nThe ... Senate that would require due to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other seat that they have been held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's [noise]\nLet me go state by state the show where this is all happening but the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this was a\nTraditional gear party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot pose which say that's exactly what's going to happen and you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see won a close race to some of the could go either way\n\nThey're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting the hoping hoping that reporting hope will\nThe hope into reality now before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\n\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia and got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much\nThere have been a lot of people who did covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and Marcy an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made then how do you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate\nIt's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten may be informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people\nIn the room that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and this trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie of target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so\nWhen I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left\nAbortion is not even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is being came as one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a gazelle himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\n\nOf a job it's probably the finest role\nThat he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGonna be immersed in a bunch of repulsive Gore\nAnd again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story up the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people who put their careers and the line agreeing to appear and start even Searcy or directing\nA close friend of Washington Post columnist Jamal ... tells Michael is a cough and me that the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... may have felt emboldened parentheses to murder but journalist\nBy Trump's anti media rhetoric Trump hates journalists and he would not react if we kill one journalist says colleague do some jewelry\nAnd so now with ... have fought to have been murdered and dismembered\nAnd by the way they think now that he's been buried in a plot of grass in the console the back yard and the console is not leaving when the consulate there Turkish officials cannot get in
