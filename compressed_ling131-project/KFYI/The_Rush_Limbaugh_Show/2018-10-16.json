did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people to lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and ... out in the American left and I have I have developed\n\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion\nAnd my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house at a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you\nLook at the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world\nUsing common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave the trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms of\nThe Democratic party who lost over twelve hundred feet nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships a you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats they were losing everything after that too\nI was sixteen election they continue\nTo lose even more and the and the dead set lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot shouldn't run ever going to sweep big never going to wipe out\nThe Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't have had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixteen elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand\nTen the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the\nTwo thousand ten midterms for rock Obama singlehandedly\nMy friends has destroyed the electrodes prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at\nTrump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against that in common sense there is no real Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to see widely reported let's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave\nIn two thousand eight Tim this is the the NBC poll or survey America\nIs experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six\nMillion vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen now we have an historic seven point one million jobs\nOpen that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one\nWith that many job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employers can set the terms\nBased on their level of expertise and experience on whatever it is they're applying for none of this\nIn the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a federal Lincoln bits of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six ... presidential election\n\nFor those of us shouting at me why but we're rushed on food so we won the popular vote by three\nIs no reason that they lost twelve hundred seats nationwide there hasn't been anything to change that they lost the Supreme Court they lost Kavanaugh they did everything they could\nThey mounted October surprise they tried to destroy the life the career of the past the future of Brett Kavanaugh to save the court nothing\nIs going their way they're not winning meanwhile what's happening on the Republican side many of you may hate hearing it something you'd never Trump person but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen the Democrats attempt contaminant\nThe Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing up probably the first standing in his career\nIn front of us are of a stadium or arena sized crowd\nI guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation daddy simply is not used to it hasn't I mean it nobody else liked the turtle in our party yes those but Trump brought him up and he got one and it got it precisely\nBy holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment a Kevin ... the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and twenty four of them\nSay they want to be president now [noise]\nBrushes\nRose after us envoys

different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter\nBut I Know a lot of people who are and in the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us this\nDNA did not actually use samples of Native American\nDNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA\nDr Carlos ... was among pay use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there counting that it's true or she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any in the in our Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is the fabric\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every now they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no not was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\nSo Hillary Clinton is making me and asked him or herself an absolute fool of herself in\nInstead of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are soon to be barking on what\nA stadium tour or yes bill\nAnd Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium to or were they are going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged that like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do and anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like people care what Trump pastor say there is no interest in what\nBill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent habit and I'm Talking about this type of charisma\nBack in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had a number of the the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\n\nThe wing of Donald Trump is it like it was it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years and his friend Gary Hart man's\nSome

wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for him [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible that I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got ... two thousand twelve to six years\nOf on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against the Democrats having fewer seats electoral seats in Washington\nAnd they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq who's saying oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American and check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\n\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke\nRaise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are close in ... has told them to go pound sand that tone has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raised among yourself I'm going to bend is the way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you\nExactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but nice him\nHe had he wanted no part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races because it was but nice [laughter]\nThe office of the presidency to go that low\nReal reason he didn't want to do with this Obama didn't have confidence of coattails and that ... is not going to want to share in any of his money\nNot being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to back to oh who is by the white ones he down seven or eight points not only the ... ah it's not fair\nThat Beto has more than ... ... and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do\n'em yeah look I also have the um the shell game situation\nAnd there's some things about this guy but I

her she's not trying to parlay this into something for her quote unquote Indian relatives and people\nThat she doesn't mention to tribal production at all\nBecause there isn't one I mean that that she has mentioned the jeep Cherokee because the high cheekbones which I think\n[noise] gee I mean millennia Trump has high cheekbones and nobody is going to say that she's Cherokee [noise] I think I think
