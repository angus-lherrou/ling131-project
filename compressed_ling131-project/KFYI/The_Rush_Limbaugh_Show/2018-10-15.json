we can't well United States doesn't do that although we do\nA San jose Rodriguez and she was equally as perplexed last night could not get over the fact how hostile Trump was to our European your union allies and there was no hostility\nI mean there's so many teachable moments of the thing I've read the transcripts it's I Know what I'm discussing I haven't heard of but we're going to listen to these uh together but the back to back to focus ... now\nJim Messina the Obama campaign very disappointed that she would try to steal the news cycle this close to the election\nAnd not that he says\nThey have to win the house and Senate to save America no they have to win the house and Senate to transform and change America against the will of the American people what the Democrats or the American left I Want to do to America is not what most Americans want America to be\n\nThey don't care about that they are willing to force\nWhat they think America should be America's transformation on everybody but\nThankfully they still have to win elections and I still maintain that I don't know when but somewhere down the road they are going to realize\nThat winning elections is the lone remaining obstacle to them getting what they want and at some point they're going to suggest that elections are not worth it because they don't win and they'll come up with some kind of alternative\nI Know it sounds like a long shot but don't don't me I Know these people but only a Democrat folks\nWould think about reports from scientists saying that\nShe might be one one thousand twenty fourth unity and would make their claim a minority status valid\nOne one thousand twenty four\nIn the\nElizabeth Warren possibly that that would be point zero nine but that's not even one tenth of one percent folks that's how little\nIndian heritage Pocahontas has\nNow scientists said that the average European American is zero point eight team percent Native Americans zero point one eight she is point zero nine she is last\nNative American than the average European American is is er New York times numbers by the way Elizabeth Warren last\nNative American average European American and we'll see what else we have here a done it that it that if Mollie Hemingway favorite part of Warren possibly being one one thousand twenty four Native American is\n...\nIs that her twenty twenty campaign is rolling it out as if it's not a complete self own how do they think this was a good idea\nI'll tell you how they think it's a good idea\nThey think they're naming Trump what they think they're embarrassing Trump remember Trump\nOffered\nTo donate a million dollars to focus hottest is favorite charity if she can prove that she were Native American so she's come out today and she is according to her doctor and sciences and so far she's established\nThat she is maybe the American and now she's asking Trump to pay off to the to the indigenous\nPeople circumcision for America group or whatever it is I forget the indigenous peoples uh circumcision information of resource that or some such thing\n\nAnd if Trump gives you know Trump's denying that he made the pledge even though we [laughter] flat out denying it like ... ...\nA sale you I'd never had sex with that woman not a single time ever and that's what Clinton was ... I I Do you need to go back and look what I said I did not say that\nAt most Trump owns a oh it was one\nOne thousand twenty fourth of one million I run that number he always maybe most of the thousand dollars\nIf he's going to pay a percentage of the million dollars that equals\nHer percentage of Native American that means he just a little over\nA thousand dollars if he wants to pay it let's go to the audio soundbites we have we have Elizabeth Warren herself this morning uh let's see this is on her website she released a video in titled Elizabeth Warren's family's story\nIsn't that queen\nElizabeth Warren's family story in one part of the video focus on us here talks to Stanford University professor of genetics Dr Carlos\nBustamante and here is a portion of their conversation\nDr tomorrow can please [noise]\nOn her genome did five five seconds on Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the rain is less than one\nPresident like to call my mom a liar\nWhat is the fact that we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nJust casual reader\n\nNeeded for the nation violence for generation I'm ... I can say whatever he wants to mocking Native Americans or any crime in order to try to get me\nWrong I now I understand why Jim Messina and the rest of the gang of the left are all in a Twitter here because she is making about her on a\nBasically non story I mean this is the election coming up isn't there isn't a single vote there has anything to do with her\nShe hasn't even announced for the presidency in fact she said just the opposite she says she's not going to run so given that why is she intruding here I'll tell you she thinks\nLike all the others on the left do they think if they can be the one to destroy Trump if they can be the ones that illustrates that whatever they think of Trump is true that they will be heroes heroines are heroes and they think they will be loves it adored that's there are so Trump focused their so Trump obsessed\nThat it is taking them off of their game again reminder New York times Elizabeth Warren is only possibly one one thousand twenty fourth point zero nine percent Indian the average European American is zero point one at a person that other words\nShe is less than half\nAs much Native American is your average European American is\n[noise]\nSo here's Moore this is a again on her website she was released this new video and titled Elizabeth Warren's family's story in another part of this exciting video\nWe have a number of university professors talking about whether her Native American heritage came up when they were considering hiring her as a professor and we've got the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin law professor Jay Westbrook another professor from the same place Doug lake Koch\nPeople's names fascinated me\nLight Koch Harvard law school professor Randy Kennedy a University of Houston\nProfessor John ... mix and and the University of Pennsylvania law professor Hank Gutman right and so here they are and\nLike just give it to [noise] okay well so much for that um [noise]\nWhat Jose Rodriguez says it missed by can I say something about college like Mohammed he's the one that was responsible for the death of Danny Pearl the wall street reporter he slit his throat in front of a camera I don't know what type of man it takes to cut the throat of somebody in front of you like that but I can tell you this is an individual probably were ranch rear end about having waterboarding his base\nHe never believed for a second year we're going to kill him know and let me tell ya he would use his fingers to count the number of seconds because he knew that in all likelihood we would stop at ten it's doesn't sound like a person Who's Afraid of dying Lesley Stahl so so what happens he\nBreakdown does he cried dizzy fall apart now he gets a good night's sleep you get to ensure\nBy the way he was very heavy when he came to watch the last fifty pounds Leslie stall what gives you ensure you mean like people in a hospital drink that stuff yes dietary manipulation was part of our dire techniques he's totally mocking her Leslie stall so sleep\nDeprivation dietary manipulation I mean this is one of the stuff the u._s. doesn't do that\nWill say Rodriguez well we do it would've been a perfect\nSetup for Leslie stall and Donald Trump we're going to get to that coming out of the break here at the bottom of the hour hang on\nWill listen to it together because like I say I didn't see it last night [noise]\n[noise]\nKFYI I knew for President Trump is Jesse Jesse Washington post columnist Jamal to show that he\nCould have been murdered by rote killers to show he was last seen October second

[noise]\nReading\nSo welcome at my friend's ... Russia ... times the golden age I'd be a microphone great to have you here [noise] yeah we're\nGoing to be discussing them in terms of the media is now flooding the zone with polling data showing that it's hopeless for Republicans just\nBugs steel yourself for this this is predictable\nIt was going to happen and they're also going to say that it's all based around Trump it's all based on Trump hatred it's all based on people rip\nRegretting their vote for Trump a reading the direction America is going in all of that I just saw it happen on CNN a\nIndependent voters switching mass in ways that Democrats in the run up to the mid term elections\nAnd if I were you I've I hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of this\nI you know in and out of tune in a way I Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of the early voting but that is uh\nThat that's happening out there so it's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth that the left bands together you don't ... I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important watcher and in our lives and that's why it's not this is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one including names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance\nOf the elections uh the the the drive by us have their formula and it's rooted in the desire\nThey have an everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of polling data\nAnd says the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awaken realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I say just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides and Democrat Party deserves to get by\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAre just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the different world and then a saying society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nThat I mean what's the allies we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile found ... some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in Danny ... and ... than the stupid country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO can protect\nAnd then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but\nJust so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this is confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a\nDemocracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\n... other where the ... and the top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of total individual income tax so in other words the bottom fifty percent pay three percent\nThere isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes and yet how often do you hear every ... both parties politicians running around and we're going to middle class after the middle ... bring the burn through brand but we got to cut when there isn't much to cut any more when it comes to wake up in Texas\nNow which small percentile of taxpayers also paid three percent or more\nIt's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone paid three point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people is the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty which is a little more rounded to fourteen hundred for teen hundred tax payers paid more\nThan the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing it is not true to say\nThey are not paying their fair share now this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce\nIncome tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay [noise] plus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more\nIs actually part and parcel with the theories\nBehind supply side economics supply side tax policy at the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for\nTeam hungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than yours is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share in taxes and we're going to ... bottom somebody just go yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid that\nYou thought Donald Trump looked like he was thinking racist thoughts listening to Kanye West last week\nThey repeat that Chris ... of CNN\nAfter playing video of Kanye West\nTalking to Trump in the oval office said he didn't care what ... said he wanted to know what racist thoughts were going on in Trump's had\nMy curiosity wasn't about what came out of ... miles my wonder went to what's going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here is my educated guess okay if other than a warmer serotonin flash of happy hormone imaginary headlines and black clubs Trump these blacker than Obama Cuomo said\nWhat other kind of racist thoughts as Trump may be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the\nRacist here the son of Mario the pious\nWho sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not president even when he cannot\nPinpointed\nAnd my house in an educated guess is Chris ... I'm a I'm thinking that you're going to guess you're in an hors ... west ... speaking Trump is thinking this is great this is great this guy's blacker than Obama this guy's on my side this guy's going to do wonders for me how does he know what's going on in Trump's then\nYou have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist I this is the kind of I think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it but I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him before those me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie saw we were up here at number oh this is a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity of consequences\nFor illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their\nParents has the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painting them for San Juan Forero\nWho launched that zero tolerance policy [noise] terror families with children and then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into console you gonna go back to\nBack out into the economy glasses\nLeslie for coming into our country illegally and part of\n... I mean part of the reason that I have to blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states you know my fault\nLeslie I've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for\nIt now she's she misspoke there\nThis law on the ... Obama certainly didn't force separation and just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama did it then there had to be good reasons for it\nRemember went down to two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nOnce they see it was on the books but he didn't enforce it what\nIs that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump begins enforce it but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included a tempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely rather law or just enacted one that separating children from their families are the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole premise some guy keeping abandon kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\n\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat of a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families when it's a law that he inherited I've looked explain why the law exists\nAnd it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally it has to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids were put in much better surroundings and Sanders while their uh their family their their their adult parents cases are being adjudicated there's nothing\nThere's nothing I mean this is the United states of America we do not due to kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more in a smear\nThat the Democrats on the left of engaged in and Trump does not backed down from it and even as I say for writing magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next she says do you think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the oceans raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nSenators\nThat the president's rallies or getting out of hand\nWhen you see him at a rally the disturbing thing isn't so much what he says anymore that's the chairs from people behind him a chance\nLock her up for example uh just on the same way flake\nSays he helped somebody challenges the president and the twenty twenty primary and says he's considering it the president and first lady getting a look at the devastation today from hurricane Michael\nTrump's arrived at Eglin air force base in the Florida Panhandle this morning there also expected to visit parts in Georgia today the deadly storm left a wide path of devastation across the southeastern us\nNow look at your money sponsored by money matters with Ken ... the Dow Jones industrial average down ... when he three points to twenty five three fourteen KFYI nice time all of\nRain overnight heavy at times we drop into the upper fifties and the showers likely to continue through the morning hours on your Tuesday to hide Tuesday Afternoon sixty seven by Wednesday back to the sunshine the high Seventy four\nCurrently Seventy one degrees here next news coming up at noon on these ... I ... a little anytime on our free I heard radiolab [noise]\n\nAs\nUsual thank you for your patients we head back to the phones were we have to the phones and this is Scott\nIn Oklahoma City right to have you here hide\nRush good to talk to you know it gives her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an antebellum a rural created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood that was black you're black\nOr this was this was a grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThey don't have ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is I don't even about her future run she needs to tell her base I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that let\nGlad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome that's why I'm a good host I have ever that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that book uh intersection out comes straight out of Marxism march said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how depressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection analogy because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of people's formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful\nUm yes any intersection out I mean it's basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist just saying that all of these different leftist organizations me somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA co habit tapes with that with militant Islam is that then with illegal immigrants and their activists and we're all of these people intersect is why they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops up some absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ship has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press\nShe's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever what I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American square\nJust submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black uh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks in okay All right\nI just want his best because a sub Saharan this is somebody what are you in sub zero what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent than some people really get confused you're jumping from from India or\nOvert sub Saharan Africa is below those arid desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of this arid desert as well\nAnd I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this\nBecause they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow\nA away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the because of the elections I I think a lot of it is rooted in they have Trump Titus many of them do\nThe dot com that'd
