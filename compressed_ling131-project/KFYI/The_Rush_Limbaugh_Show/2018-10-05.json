{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Namely Dianne Feinstein had the information in July about this letter\nDianne Feinstein could have had a closed door hearing on these charges she could've forwarded that letter onto the chairman Chuck Grassley she could have said this is a point of investigation that we need\nAnd\nWhen you know when you know the fact that this happens a lot look at the voices of reason look at John Kyl John Kyl came on the show this week and said\nWas a mechanism that every senator on the committee ... million with that allows us to address these sensitive issues in a way that protects the anonymity of the doctor and the character of the judge until results are\nAre gotten you said it happened\nIn his Eighteen years he spent Eighteen years on the Judiciary Committee and with all those judicial nominees coming his way from both parties Republicans and Democrats that Eighteen years\nHe's had a lot of times this happened you get information through an FBI background check about a lifestyle he said normally it's drug use and you bring the nominee and sometimes the evidence is so bad\nThat the nominee will withdraw their own nomination sometimes the White House looks at it and said we didn't know that and they withdraw the nomination other times the nominee ghost went up or down vote and sometimes they were in sometimes they were out but it was handled in a manner that wasn't the freak show\nThere is no doubt no doubt that Dianne Feinstein was looking to create the freak show she held the letter and recommended and attorney to the doctor after that\nConversation with the doctor and recommendation she had closed door meetings one on one with Brett Kavanaugh never mentioned it there were closed door hearings\nWith Brett Kavanaugh never mentioned it they submitted Thirteen hundred questions in writing to Brett Kavanaugh never mentioned it thirty two hours of open testimony never mentioned it\nAfter all the testimony was given after five hundred thousand pages of documents Thirteen hundred questions thirty two hours closed\nDoor meetings in the final minutes Dianne Feinstein says look it is when you got to look at this\n\nAnd then her name was released and made public the Republicans didn't release this name the Democrats did she said she wanted to remain anonymous they have a mechanism in place where she could have been shirt this doctors anonymity had her story before them investigated by the FBI\nGotten to the bottom of this in a closed door session that's not what they wanted\nCory Booker said yesterday it is not whether he is innocent or guilty this is not a trial did we raise enough questions to need to move on to another nominee\nIn other words it doesn't matter if he did this re didn't do this have we throw enough dirt on this man to make it look like he's bad and we should go to somebody else Cory Booker said those words it's not whether he's innocent or guilty have we raised enough questions\nThat's disgusting\nIf he didn't do any of these things why are you damaging why would you do this to another human being two words power in politics\nThey are losing their grip on the courts the courts have leaned left for a long time the Ninth Circuit court of appeal especially in the Supreme Court to a certain degree\n[noise] my friends on the left our ... our lamenting that they're saying that Brett Kavanaugh is going to get rid of roe v Wade and it's going to get rid of the motor investigation and I reminded them the ... bomber appointed Elena Kagan as Sonia Sotomayor\nSo that they would make sure all the weight never got overturned what a shock presidents appointing ... or nominate people to the Supreme Court based on ideology what a shock\nYou're acting is a Donald Trump is doing stuff that hasn't been done before\n\nBrett Kavanaugh is a brilliant judge and has been raped over the coals and the reason why I'm so passionate about it is because it could happen to anyone of us that had a wild child and like I did and I wasn't a criminal I never broke the live never committed a felony in my life\nAnd they still could have done it to me\nIt's friday looking forward to the weekend especially to tomorrow's vote but we end the week with our national anthem to thank the men and women that serve our community that serve our country and the families that support them if you're a first responder a member of our military you have our utmost respect and thank you\nAnd it's why we do this each week because of all the division we go through all week long it's something all of us should celebrate and that is that we all are Americans in the end our ability to debate and argue the way we do is what makes us the best\nSo have a great weekend every one we're back Monday morning at six AM so until then keep attuned here to KFYI God Bless\nAnd\n\n\n\nNa na\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nUm [noise] we are the valleys talk station is used dogs five feet KFYI Phoenix Jay y o da see to Phoenix and I urge radio station [noise]\n\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has both Arizona senators to force\nFrom the KFYI newsroom good morning I'm Greg Paul Arizona Republican Jeff Flake says he will vote yes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hours after this vote was taken now I Want to\nSay I'm not surprised by Murkowski who voted no a lot of people are asking is the vote now going to not get a change I mean if we have the culture about and we got the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comments not just on social media but so the officers that so many Republican senators are getting their being Daewoo used\nTheir entire families are being threatened\nTheir grandchildren are being threatened their wives or their husbands bar made everybody they know being threatened\nIt's enormous it is never ending the funds don't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in is on the enraged it is vile and it is evil\nAnd it's not just flake and columns and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think they have\nTo be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures flake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only\nMembers of the pain professional mob squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh's of vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threats these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this is his final term uh the\nEasy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats that he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious wave he is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan Collins a senator from Maine I Can't describe for you you might have an idea you're probably\nKnow the things that are being sent to these people the free rat that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society\n\nIt's unhinged much of it is is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I Believe constitute now the mainstream of the Democrat Party the protestors are paid\nTheir signs are all identically manufactured in the same phrases all over them\n\nAnd these people I don't know if you've received threats and I don't know if you've been ...\nBy them but if you have an if you believe them they can on an interview\nAnd yet flake and Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nAnd of course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be not the thinking on this goes that that there is no way she wouldn't vote yes on the procedural vote this morning if for intention is to vote no down the road\nIf you're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any of these theories or traditions can be hoisted up\nAnd used and relied on I think we're in we're in brand new territory here for a number of reasons\nI don't think you can say that just because Susan Collins voted yes this morning means that guarantees she's going to vote yes tomorrow and then why make a statement at three o'clock why why make some ... wife three o'clock and why make some statement\nI Try to keep my ego out of this as much as I can tell when I see somebody is going to make\nA statement a three o'clock first thing I realize this I'm not going to be here to comment on it\nA list that they give you an idea what's happening to fly and it's happening all I remember that elevator confrontation where these two women in a CNN camera just ran into the elevator an ambush the guy started shouting and they ... it looked like it totally a nerve damn well the woman and it was portrayed\nBy sea and it's just a couple of citizens are happened to be walking through the Senate they saw flake and they got limited they tracked him down and they went in the elevator an average citizen journalism they weren't average citizen you're part of the pay mob and one of the babies involved at MIT said this morning on C. N. N. and this is Anna\nMaria art Sheila question where is the disconnect then the conversation ... day in\nOrder to how the housing market the show for a political either when I\nDo not have to wait until I saw\nI encourage that actually people around the country\nFor that were happening when overcoming some of the one thing for the first night he who was then the elevator never talked to like it official ten minutes before we felt like talking about how and\nHim why I sat right so you're seeing there sitting outside planning this a little coaching going on a Anna Maria art GI is the uh call executive director of the center for popular democracy which is a Soros Hillary Clinton and Trump group\nBut the point is they're not average ordinary citizens outraged by what's going on the political activists but the press portrays this people as just outraged American women outraged at the status of male dominance in American Made\nTheir way America outrageously and it's not all he wasn't ambushed by a political mob waiting\nFor a confirmation vote from the KFYI newsroom read Paul a Senate confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is expected to happen tomorrow or Sunday Republican Jeff Flake things Kevin ... will be confirmed\nWe've all been saying\nTo the difficult decision for everybody really is so many ways that are kind of ...\nFlags says he's a yes

Seventy two\nRight now it's beautiful outside Seventy nine and in Phoenix your next news is an eleven a new stock five fifty KFYI available anytime\nOn our free I heart radio way\nThe course of the many recent months I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American leftist to transform America\nAway from its intentions and it's designed this town to and in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration will look to do it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America meant so why did he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do with transfer America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy\nOf the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist\nBack look and there's a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taking a [noise]\nYou know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the ground is just what you see\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding of formative late to the question now\nNow how can that be 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance self reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism\nSocialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to our race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress on how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want to power around with women\nWhatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course you got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as\nFamous and hot women get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful\nAnd targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic the D. emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence base here not just flapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I had been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men oppose that reminds me hang on here you need to grab\nAn audio soundbite here it's a bit of it but I Do but it will be there but it would have six and seven [noise]\n[noise]\nOh quote Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal though except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\n[noise] another poll quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary it's combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime with the intrinsic American ideal\nOf white male privilege because Kevin ... is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long ... why did he blah burned like a newborn he has plot ... his career you'll see\nHe hasn't had a series of goals and achieve them all all that guy is that dangerous schemer\nHe has plot and they get on the Supreme Court where he can rule against minorities and women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know you were you what Trump allude in any way to women's time of the month and all hell is going to break loose\n\nHere miserable and get to talk about it as Lawrence common and every day and everybody gets everybody understands it\nAnd everybody knows what it means it means to stay away leave it alone don't engage yes ma'am yes ma'am three bags for whatever and go on\nShe said many minutes\nBy alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the men in mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the judiciary\nCommittee he has um I've never seen him this animate I've never seen a turtle this animated this week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might have Senator Feinstein and in this wider he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you will surely wouldn't produce it as quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so\nYou are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial a doctor Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence but the the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitting that she took a lie detector well her warriors did and that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass and we've been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed away after we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you\nHave claimed some reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley saying you must be you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over to therapy and now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and any of the following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating underrepresented what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching huh whatever\nI mean he's loaded for bear this is the kind of ... out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum\nThat you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't have been to the Senate or are they the\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah\nIs centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro when you hear things about kid in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they coming from public service that\nOught to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened\nTo judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule by voting to confirm judges Kevin ... before\nThat was during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party there resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth heat up I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nI may have to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it\nI got an email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nWent and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns medium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the\nElection she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a woman that she\nLikes to children and [noise] it's terrifying we hear [laughter]\n\nThat's what a masterful way pulled off we got to everybody in this country thinking hey that something you did what happened did that we have nothing to do with it when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay\nAnd that's why ... won't turn off or any of the cycle or the therapy and the polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at\nAnd the Republicans notice too but the power of the Democrats look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and can confirm Kavanaugh this democratic machine is a scary\nScary bunch Democrat machine includes the media and all of these psychological deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committed violence\nFrom it came from Democrats it didn't come from you it doesn't come from your hard work it doesn't cover yourself our minds it comes from them and you're going to learn it and love it and living by golly by gosh or else you're going to be punished\nThis party deserves to be so soundly defeated in November that we haven't seen anything like it\nIf they lose if they do not win the house if they do not win the Senate if they lose seats in both then that might\nMake some of the leaders of the party\n\nReef think their current strategy but if they win based on this it's going to get even worse than it's been this politics of personal destruction is\nGoing to be amplified and every Republican is going to be targeted in every political media opponent is going to be targeted\nIf
