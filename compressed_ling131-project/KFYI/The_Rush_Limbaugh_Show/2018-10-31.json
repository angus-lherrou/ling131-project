your joints son in law we don't want any of you here go away but\nTrump goes to the hospital one of the professional treated the wounded and gets very very warm welcome you don't see that report it\n[noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\n\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you got to the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in a story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a saw out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what\nPaul and you look at I don't care what professional you talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there\nIsn't anybody who knows who's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are\nBut it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows bottom line\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good word you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand and fourteen two thousand twelve was one of those\nTwo elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money and that seat\nWon the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he is intolerable since that one election where he was an infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned in Nate Silver distaste sandman when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat ... said pets get us in the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poll either the polling company he's never run a campaign and condos flight was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality to the guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear\nOut to be true and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this is like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blob play\nAnd to become flat line\nAnd it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against\nYou and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump prep to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it all kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it isn't\nThere you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting in the country's again Democrats saying the same thing\nBut it's out there it's a conversation starter nothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all it is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base\nThat's where you're wrong Trump does made it\nIt is about\nTime this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded in the snow complicated mistreated\nThis this is what it is that's who the opponents are very hell bent and they're not going to stop\nUntil they until they went and now the Mueller investigation looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced\nThat Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia you know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically until many of these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed mother has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time\nDespite the factor in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that\nHow many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers making sure that Trump wants to send the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen Trump never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides you're participating in the news\nNow is the Trump might speak with Mueller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nTakeaway is that the primary weapon to Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled it's not there so they're turning they always do\nAnd we need a white guy ban or to go along with the travel ban andme a Muslim ban because the biggest terror threat in this country right now is white\nMen this of course ignores\nAll of the people of color protests marches antifa who inflict damage and harm on people of course the black lives matter\nA rope but you see a\nWhat's interesting about this are noteworthy about it is this is what is really thought of non lemons not alone here he just happened to be the guy that set it\nBut that happens to be the driving impetus\nBehind much of extreme liberalism they certainly that is what's driving militant feminism angry women they think white men at the problem white Christian men are the problem in virtually every instance so that dates back to the founding of Africa and this was the organizing\nEnergy force behind much of radical liberalism today\nThat white men are the problem from the establishment of the American government is a capitalistic economy\nUh to the United states in general just setting themselves up as the majority and they now wreak havoc and they get unfair benefits and so forth and so on and so this this is the culture wars that we are in and this\nIs the side opposes ah [noise]\nThat's why this stuff is all crucial [noise] early voting

[noise]\nNon Lenin ... says it on Monday Night on CNN and its\nNoticed today and again he's talking the freight formal\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week and can turkey another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover it\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean there's the pumps I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the left as concerned as white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's down on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view of the American left is white men who created this racist and bigoted unfair unjust immoral country\nDo not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from\nThe traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary and evidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins\nNow it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and have been for a while to energize everybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at right men or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\n\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people and notice how quickly they want to\nDo bad notice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it the raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority of media you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon and said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter are the Republicans in that group looking number of police officer been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matters the borders and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well there are cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve Sebelius almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas who

five fifty KFYI Phoenix ... to Phoenix and I are the radio station [noise]\n\nAre heating up across America from the KFYI newsroom I'm Greg Paul President Trump has over ten rally schedule\nConsumers that any other business out there\nAny other retail business I think the news business as people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does don't know if one\nI don't know of a business who ... who who reject half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit that it was is assuming\nAn operating on the assumption that whatever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks or everybody cares about it so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf that momentum was interrupted ... imaging level declined in wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Ford miners\nYeah Fort Myers are thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies plan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy [noise]\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever hasn't circumstances\nLike this so whatever is out there in the daily news media is not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that\nAll of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb in the synagogue shooting\nThis is you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's going to happen on election day and I don't believe in Rio's does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe in the ... not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close to me that we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something you know nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up criticizing Trump saying why you\nCan't do that that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself\nIs not even getting that message out I don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus if it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nAs one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these ah incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about ... why\nIs it why is it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great piece today [noise] speaking of Kevin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign with her allegations whatever cabin on there that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any\nBut the media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin all was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's name to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets to come from work it's got the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it if Kavanaugh was\nSuch a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rates serial rapists where is all it just it's going on is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political dont\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they've still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital of us accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed and the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about capping off as true it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been\nOne of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy may laying eyes to terrify do here and so they had to build an excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYou Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents they still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are gonna have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot to wait to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all of okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was\nAnd the proof than it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now\nThere's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy and Kevin ... they lost and their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrats hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nIn their final rallies before next Tuesday's general election tomorrow Donald Trump junior will be in the valley to stump for Republican Senate candidate\nA Martha ... soundly at the elections already over for those who have already cast their early ballots in Arizona more than a

Minnetonka, Minnesota this is a Ella image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much for taking my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because ... was becoming mine I handle I started writing my class has caused courses because I couldn't handle how they had read sized American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is one needs and millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way the Democrats want it now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nEspecially looking at their eyes they take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship doctor perform has examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were\nSent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want anyone could not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to tell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work\nUm there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one paving the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will hold a lot of everybody not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about the kind of history he's going to be learning it so I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books oh wow you know\nVery one it's hard because I think that where's he going to get it he's not gonna learn it from his own history books all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nAll try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties did a survey of\nThe most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in referenced Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example in an American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard's\nIn as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold the vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were much newer in younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was Rick wired that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were\nAllowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a ... game standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one more than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect\nOf any of these gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled\nIt just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who have been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little Biddy computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes\nNow let's go to the audio soundbites vis vis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nPresident of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history president was greeted by hungry protesters singing this land is your land protesters with\nI think the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protest or not support what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Columbus hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come in every did gum they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump first lady you Monica Trump Jared Kushner walking\nThrough the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shooting that\n\nThey were\nComing back to reach drinker and again\nThat you have to try and keep having chance\nYou will not see this on any network newscast you will not see that video on any news channel anywhere thank you\nThank you President Trump that you were a mock it thank you we love you said you were coming thank you all very much no thank you sir you're the best the best great job thank you Mr President we love you thank you can I shake their hand serve thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jay tempers are the protests were not surprise you nobody wanted the president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your ship trip and I thought this was not your place you know business going they don't want you to forty thousand people signed a petition asking him not to\nCome oh wait we're not through we day at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center\nAnd now I'm a lawyer you're the first lady and Monica Trump gets to love to\nThank you very rainy and you\nDo over him or her name is good you often do you think yeah I Love your longer [laughter]\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump has done that that's what's conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that\nThe closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in self Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house\nIn those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two but nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it\nJust totally came out of their sales in two thousand two\nEverybody thought everybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats\nThe left was done ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain\nWhat's gonna happen they end up being surprised the brightest minds been greatest go rose the most heralded the analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here a pie is from uh motives are real clear politics by one of the written down the\nWhole analysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it printed out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as mid terms and her final\nStretch nominate tells you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nTo twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots\nIn California the consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a bunch of polls get results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionately toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of up to twenty five to two hundred ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting do a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't\nBother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here that the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyzed ... because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words and I'm just ... days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less\nFashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on the street print day here\n\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is just to do he can think of where it might their talents that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to to twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec uh in New York's\nTwenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests but what about the Nineteen\nRepresentative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not [noise]\nAnybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here leads to reexamine things [noise]\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning\nHow reliable aren't on this thing\nAnd then the next ... are we relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know in the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so we're going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the candidate go competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've\nSeen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh them [noise] we don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but\nWhat if there are tens of surprises regardless of whether that happens\nWe're well set up for such an event you out on the bottom line I happen to live with that idea what's going to happen but in my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize is one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up where there's much intelligence analysis you can muster\nAd that Google has prevented from being run Google does not allowing this and this is this is the is fourteen seconds listen\n[noise]\n\nAnd the tagline there is stop the mob vote Republican\nAnd this ad has been the subject of censorship\nOr from Google ... under the other guy is that what\nWhat did they say it is it's a it's a [noise]\nI don't ... I forget the term they use but the reason is effective it's effective against the left and so Google\nIs um man and get those are the kinds of things that people are up against and if there's a journalist David ... who ah who writes and [noise] of quote on his work here a bunch of times and he's out saying something that I have\nMentioned on this program countless times that of course the Democrat Party\nIs the drive by media and vice versa drive by media is the\nDemocratic Party they are they in fact I I think the drive by media is actually the organizing power a behind the Democrat Party and Mr ... Sandy you're saying this but he's he's saying that in his opinion a growing number of the American people are aware of it now\nThe federalist that's right that's right he was a Mollie Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are succinctly aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and it'd be a way beyond by us if if that's true for a number of these things are true then there could very well be a major surprise and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\n'cause it's a parent now they think they've got this [noise]\nRoberts ours facing
