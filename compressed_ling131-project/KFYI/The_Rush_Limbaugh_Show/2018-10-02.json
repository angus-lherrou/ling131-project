even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nHe says there was discussion of a blue wave been generic battles advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on it you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nI'm going to leave your little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on\nThis and back then you know nine months ago the Democrats had a twelve point advantage\nAnd that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ...

away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England

stops the tape but the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win and yet look what you want to do it you were making beds you bring guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know\nBefore it's over who's going to win no

a cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it in a sweater let's let's use that when it first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right\nSpeaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out there is no Fox News there is no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites start everything's starting to ... to to blossom at that point but but this program nationally was still in four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh\nUp the uh building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course uh I I\nWas living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\n\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio isn't that by the way\nThis more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo as a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht think was his name drew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead\nBaby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine and the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\n\nWell one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that's cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford and judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of this ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back\n[noise] some public and the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin ... daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry\nLying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford now as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do\nAs a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot camera and you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this is a come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vital\nIt's filthy if dirty and disgusting it's despicable and it's sick and of course it has accomplished it's objective it's gone viral and people have seen that people are reacting to it\nAnd I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets an I decided to go ahead and do it\nIn my never\nEnding quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh Kevin ... says another prayer\nDear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just it flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in our lives of suffered psychological just of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nThe sake of the party and the second Trump's presidents that was the exact opposite\nSo don't dumped me on this ... that these people in the media you have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurts them to the quick\nIt disturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about it as high just did\nOn CNN NBC News desperately\nTrying to convict Kevin all at the same

friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh so on good\nMorning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know\nAll the details yet but clearly if they have been given free rein to interview whomever they want and that's a very good sign the last thing we want to say Sam investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to get this done by friday of really\nFor the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have an audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself and that means he's not quite on what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rapist next the frozen ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe's a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer yeah are they friday's fight yeah there's not too many people to talk through here FBI has got a lot of short or we can get this\nDone that's just to central maybe White Houses out their\nTruck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin\n... in anything uh there's one more [noise] that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio or something\nNumber twelve [noise] the question of who leak Dr Ford letter to Dianne Feinstein you don't just\nDozens of leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the leak but she clearly talked about it and said that she had it since July and that\nShe told us all about it that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I don't

secret and I managed to\nFind out about it I found out there were probably a hundred people in Washington this secret and kept it for a very long time new and\nI are not stupid people we may not be praying for I not stupid and once you get us on a case like that and lots of people are talking to each other one leads to another and it doesn't have to be a member of the Senate currently it doesn't
