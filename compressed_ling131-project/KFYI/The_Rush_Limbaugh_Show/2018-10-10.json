get people to listen to get their attention but there's always a lot\nOf hype and these things and as an expert a local resident expert I can tell you that people who live in these areas for a long time I heard this over and over again and very rarely are these storms as bad as they predict and so people over the course of time\nAdopt an attitude you have they're making it worse than that it's going to be for whatever reason they started to scare everybody get them to evacuate or what have you\nUm\nPeople deal with it is in different ways who live in areas and have experience with um now\nI'm there have been four major hurricanes in the two years of the Trump presidency\nAnd\nNot a one of them outside of this mess in Puerto Rico not a ... one of them have the media been able\nTo

the other day about an anti Trump or did you come up [noise]\nPro pro democratic ... ... oh yeah it was Tennessee she came out against black burn right uh what is the media say the media said record turnout rent current voter registration after Taylor Swift\nHow many people bought that that is such Koch guy there is no way to measure that\nThat's wishful thinking but the reason I bring this up\nAnd I don't know Taylor Swift from a pile of coal I don't know that you can put a bag of nowhere in a bag out there and I wouldn't know the difference in Taylor Swift now\nThe story is Taylor Swift lead American music awards hit all time low in ratings well how how can that be if she is generating massive record voter registration and then the hosts the television show an all time low record ratings\nDon't I don't have one thing or another but Taylor Swift I don't I'm not comparing hurt your bag of a newer I'm saying that's how it significant but I'm the drive by trying to take these things they're so desperate for good news they're desperate\nFor you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com\nAnd it's a column by somebody named brand Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team ... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord benefit\nA former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise] well what I read that or not he still writes pieces for the for the whole dot com Butowsky code red alert to Democrats\nWhat are the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the hill dot com had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama warmly most popular respected public figures in America shouldn't spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and\nSenate this\nColumn is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way this column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms\nAre the most popular in respect the Democrats with America such as Michelle my bell Obama to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid term as well the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent\nThe chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you were pretty much had the house already done\nMostly is already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on then Trump or first myself\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance that Democrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite\nThe same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for Bolden maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\n\nSays it's possible the Democrats win the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible of Democrats again only twenty seats falling short\nOf winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\n\nMy point is again do\nNot fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they really believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be disparity of hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up the turnout ... up interest and they're really flux and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News poll a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have a ... new interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed to happen\nThat's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative suburban\nWomen and do we need them or not and we don't\nThey say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six soon as you remember any pieces before the presidential race anywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey\nYou know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of a a convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all the press that Trump quarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is though power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power every American realizes the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter\nCan't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen\nNielsen\nSaid yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the terms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... are attempting to sway American opinion I have the elections\nOf ... once in a whim [noise]\nChai comes want the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party to win and they're trying to counter not our friends at trying calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate\nAnd triumph over the ... I don't want any part of Trump Donald Trump\nThis this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this was done\nThis has put China back on its heels\nLike nobody thought Donald Trump the United states now controls access to Mexico and uh and all of North America United States and Canada you've got to go through us you've got to make deals with us if you want to export you're going into Mexico Canada United States\nBecause Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the ... never thought this was going to happen\nThey don't want Trump they don't want any more if Trump they wouldn't be eager for whoever the Democrats put up I just find it fascinating international bunch of communists are trying to affect our elections so that they're friendly Democrat Party and America wins\nThat somebody has to have much to say\nRussia's probably AI being met four day inform\nUsed talking five fifty KFYI [noise]\nWhen you put a safe and you're home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one branch of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's rhino saves the craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skills sweat and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure\nBeen put through what do you make about Hillary\nAnd what message including the president's mock gang of Christie ... Ford for her allegations what message does that send\nTo women and remember women went for President Trump into thousands sixteen Hillary seven white women did I'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one white women\nWhite women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice in the last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd\nThere again Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination the Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why this kind of a Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged\nInto so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to seat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\n\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the lightest and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christianity and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the apps\nThat judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance for the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts if you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrat activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most sterling example of\nThis but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... the ass not by you in fact to\nHillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly\nI Would love to see us returned disability Christ you out on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Mary ... and here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\n\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nIs that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrats should denounce they're not going to denounce or they privately\nLife in season\nHas been gone from the KFYI newsroom and defer down early voting started today in Arizona\nWe don't have an election day we have an

meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump doesn't seem to have any real interest since he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the
