I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this uh anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a Democrat voters is less\nThan what we think it is just because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and\nDo nothing and twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the Democrat rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixty and they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it rather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that\nI can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer to the to the truth than not [noise] but for those that\nDon't get it it amazes me that it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative\nOf the uh the party\nAt large here's Jake Christian Adams writing is PJ Media Kevin off pose fills Senate gallery was sounds of being saying\nSo but as any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on the hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited hospitals for the seriously\nMentally ill endless shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery were as odd and on earth waiting as anything I ever heard\nSide and a mental hospital they echoed off the halls in ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning apple dude\nAnd then the role was called it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting howling screaming in an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was RE Engine was hate\nIt was poison in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with discord ... madness and the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics these were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination and they weren't an embarrassment to themselves\nAnd their rights pay attention that's what the ... sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to least bit concerned about it\nThe Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all\nThis kind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\n\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant madness which\nWill result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in two and not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics Andy in same face to face\nBut what it means to me is I don't know that they can get\nMore rapid\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen to get them more fired up than they are\nSteven

mainstream media both\nToday and over the weekend\nThey are related to cap and all but they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the\nFor the Democrats and much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this if it stuns me that\nPeople on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is a is John Harris and political one of the

fact that they do is fascinating to me now here's another such pace and we have said that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when\nHer name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on

the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program in the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot succeed\nIn implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts and\nThat's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges rule of law and there is a dirty little secret behind this\nFolks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers\nTo implement and pass their agenda legislatively otherwise they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America\nThey have to rely on activist judges to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia mergers before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its its relevance its power\nAnd intimate Portland's has been magnified in this current cabinet fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court and any other number of cultural issues which\nAre designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point what they believe in the idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\n\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these\nYears you've Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you renting it he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate

that sounding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot refute this everything they want\nEverything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeon the into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what did they do they show you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you

I'm not exaggerating this is what they're teaching and this is what these young people believe\n\nThe audio soundbites we've talked about this woman before Rebecca Traister she was on C. span two on Saturday\nSaturday show called afterwards why does does she was running for attorney general or is an attorney general and she said something outrageously stupid that we I live in here and I forgot what it is but it's in the Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez vain and it just it it just asinine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's in our show our cars but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but this is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nAnd the host of the CSPAN after one show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\nQuestion if the devastating to me that if a white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life for private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think his hand do we also acknowledged that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products no power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nThen in fact is this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need why women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate means do ask do we need white women [noise] now this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported\nCabinet him and I don't know if it was so much that white women supported Kevin ... is that they were ... is scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men they have sons they have brothers and anybody would have half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind\nTo see that the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were told not to lay guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable in fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stuck but it is it is a woman making the point that Kevin wrong\nIs as good as guilty because he\nCould have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe lousy for that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss what is transpiring that men are\nAutomatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to happen\nThey rushed to begin to your show you are you at a rhetorical question about the does the Democrats really believe in this this new tactic but the mob\nAnd amend the Democrats learning surgeons they become a political uncertainty and as you noted thirty the learn to feed it they just change tactics and the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine balls before they had a two for they had someone that not only educates argued\nThat someone that was wanting to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront\nAnd ah thankfully we tromp through cannot has put some ... on the spider Republicans\nA ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think of this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros under these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down\nYou think the American public watching that is going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm a king a book titled the way things ought to be an automated people outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just column for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have\nShow up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the event hadn't happened and what twenty nine days left it it happened\nA true yeah I went on when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox saying a lot of learning pungent commentators oh this was going to be so old by then actually heard a couple of people say the things that\nPeople are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle um so I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot maintain this river passion for long nobody can\nWelded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm ... I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's still a month ago\nThe other side they had been chomping at the bit since election night two thousand sixteen and metal only getting more\nAnd Rush Limbaugh\nFees for gay inform used on five fifty K.

Bush the victory ill legally\nNever mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here\nThe U.S Supreme Court had to step in and stop it because it was out of control and when they did the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward George W. Bush was an illegitimate president and he didn't stop being a legitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the money's\nSix years later\nIn the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have to pay the\nCountry back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back and they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and the Al Gore being duly recognize as the legitimate winner of the\nPresidency even though Al Gore didn't want to be part of it by that time they were feeling so up so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial honoring and celebrating the life of\nWellstone it was about three weeks prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand to\nThe ... stone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a pure Paul lipstick will rally\nThe purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone Republican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing if we showed up\nAt the arena they did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in a plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was\nI don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial anyway Republican senator is not knowing up from down there I'm Trent Lott and the boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial\nA religious memorial ... owner of a a former colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm food and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having arrived in sat down was identical\nTo what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the worthy Republicans receded and getting in their faces and pointing fingers at um a booming at them they thought\nThere to participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what it is\nHappened on nine eleven for this memorial this Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve\nAnd I remember I was invited as the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted\nAnd I went and I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycled other\nPeople through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans had gained ... seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big\nBecause Democrats told everybody hated Bush everybody of resented the wave of Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just reached and that the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence\nAnd as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats to take back control of what is right will be there as Washington DC\nExcept it didn't happen the Republicans gained ... seats\nTim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said well stone memorial\nBut Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why and a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president does elected so that's a formative experience for me\nAnd if it's I like ... if it's happened once it can happen again something that hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if it has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that\nExcept this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior the Wellstone memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display for two full years\nAnd actually longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public the arrangement\nPublic insanity psychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too have sat in the Senate gallery as a young boy\nMy parents took my brother and me in Washington DC one summer\nAnd the Senate was in session and I'll Remember a Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill\nI was fourteen or Fifteen\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet or a book some some kind of a a manual explaining what the Senate was and what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed that book away from me\nAnd said you are making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted\nThe gallery could not do anything more than ...\nYou were not allowed to chew gum people\nWere chewing gum and the pages said you're leaving Rauscher putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it you're not staying here to income\nThey would come which for this to you they took my little pamphlet a way\nI felt like they just stop all just come and then I'm watching this thing the other night in these in these these these these women are going batty\nSounding literally like they are in things out of the loan that and they don't want to be there and I couldn't even make out what they're saying it sounded like Christian Adams said it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there and Tom Mike\nPence was saying over and over the sergeant ... sergeant unarmed restore orderly gallery the surgeon unarmed will restore order and the gallery sergeant arms as having a hell of a lot of trouble restoring order in the gallery\n\nAs I said the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I.\nP.
