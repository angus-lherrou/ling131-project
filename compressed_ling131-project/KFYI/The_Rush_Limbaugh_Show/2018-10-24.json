life he lives in Maryland [laughter] horrible I was going down a citizen [laughter] no he's a furry [noise]\nAllowed on airplanes as though anybody had to be told but I just I I Want to join everybody here I'm a people stature all over America\nAre issuing statements today condemning the use of bombs for any purpose whatsoever and we here at the E R B network heartily\nAnd energetically endorsed the premise that we oppose bombs for any purpose whatsoever [noise]\nAh in domestic politics or what have the only time we support bombs is during warfare a declared hostilities warfare but bombs in politics or caravans wrote we hardly we hardly condemn\nThis dastardly action and what isn't no way encourage it or support so just to have it on the record that's my official statement yesterday released this in writing\nTo um [noise]\nJust get it to make sure that we here at the number are included in the list of people will condemn 'cause I don't want to be on the list of people who support\nOr are there any is there a list of people's support bombs that that is going out there yeah I think the list is only people who condemn them right we want to make sure we are on their ... that we don't want there to be any doubt\n[noise] that we can do the mom okay so suspicious packages slash bombs that did not go off\nHave been censored Democrats before the mid term elections\nIs it real or is it a political set up is it a political stunt and if it is who's behind if it's a political stunt who's behind it and for what purpose\nI've seen some people today who think the Republicans are behind this to try to scare Democrats away from going to the polls\nThat's a new one on me that just doesn't compute that that's not the kind of thing Republicans do\nIn fact you remember when Steve ... got shot by a deranged Democrat at congressional baseball practice you know what our side said\nWe did not make a political the Republicans in Congress said this speaks to all of us we join everybody in condemning this the Republicans did not attempt to make that part is in any way or to try to make hay out of it I'm not kidding go back and look at it if you've forgotten is\nThe Republicans did not make a point of singling out the guy as a Democrat and condemning the Democrats as essentially said that this is about all of us Republicans just don't have a behavioral history\nLike this so it was a political staunch who is behind it and for what purpose\nWell the capital of thing was a set up but it looked real for a while\nThe Kevin off thing was a set up from the get go we of course here at the E R B network knew that about a lot of people thought it was real on ... it was exposed as a fraud the Democrats couldn't covered their bases long enough\nTo what to pull that off Hillary Clinton a rumored to run for president just before her certain them to be poor my intended national tour with her husband\nWe have a massive land force invasion heading toward our southern border meant for a confrontation just before election day\nWhat if there are leaks from Mueller about his report before the elections political stunts or not [noise] would Mahler in the media really do that look\nWhat happened to the FBI in two thousand sixteen they tried to fix it election for a Democrat they tried to screw a Republican out of the election and to me these are all things that we know and it wasn't just a handful of rogue FBI agents involved it was the top tier leadership\nThe one thing that we know to be true that Democrats are pulling out all the stops they see this election as their last best chance to take down Trump and his agenda\n\nIt's October [noise] another way of looking at\nThis for the last few weeks the Democrats have had all of that horrible PR all of these angry mobs and I don't care what anybody thinks\nThose angry moms are not good for the Democratic party those angry mobs are not going to stop turnout those angry mobs are not sending a signal joined us\nMuch as the media would like to portray it otherwise and much of that Democrats would like to portray otherwise the people of this country do not want to spend all day and all night everyday enraged and angry that's not what life\nUsed to most people and they don't want it to be that but that's what life is or your average Democrat today enraged angry upset certainly unhappy\nNot content\nAnd they're hoping to win elections based on that there hasn't been a single that I've heard a single statement of condemnation for any of these acts\nCommitted against Republicans by Democrats mobs people who have been caught on tape threatening Republicans' in restaurants\nPeople who I've been caught on tape for rent named Republicans at airports\n\nRepublican offices that had been vandalized rocks thrown for windows Kevin McCarthy the most recent\nAngry mobs sending packages that claimed to be ... rice and the two Republican Senator Susan Collins at her house\nWe have seen these angry mobs in the halls of the Senate during the capital hearings we have seen these angry bombs at political rallies we have seen these angry mobs come from the people in public in restaurants doesn't matter where and they have all\nBeen Democrat angry mobs and there has not been a single condemnation from any Democrat like everybody today is condemning these bombs there hasn't been a single condemnation by any Democrat forties mob actions taking place\nThat has been going on since even before that Kavanaugh hearings\nReally focused and got synthesized when it began to appear that Kevin always got to make an added this balls the foreign tactic was gonna fall apart the mobs went nuts approaching Jeff Flake\nIn the elevator approaching Republicans in the halls Lindsey Graham is ... ... we saw that\n\nThis cannot be good these eight reminds I don't care what Democrats think they can now see it isn't working the Republicans are pulling ahead in the Senate and when we get into the discussion of the latest\nRegarding mid term elections as the program unfolds today I've got a couple of pieces today from people who think that not only if they're not going to be a blue wave\nThat if there were it would be cresting right now and it isn't I got a couple of people been analyzing things who think that there could very well be a red wave not just in the Senate but in the house the point is the mob actions that have been sponsored by an undertaking by\nDemocrats and their activists again have not been condemned and they haven't worked\nTheir purpose they're mob purpose was to engender author anger at Republicans and therefore in gender angry democratic turnout but look Republican turnout in early voting is dwarfing the Democrats in some places it isn't even close and it's a hundred and eighty degrees out of phase\nNothing like what the political experts and scientists told us what happened in an off year election this was going to be the Democrats are like you were going to show up in in droves energized\nThey were going to be so excited they were going to be so motivated Republican early voting is dwarfing there's nothing out there other than Nate Silver and a couple of other polling units that suggests\nA blue wave and what kind of blue wave going to be if it doesn't include\nThe Senate\nIf some people now that think the Republicans might end up fifty seven fifty eight seats in the Senate it's all a toss up I mean nobody really knows right now but the point is the conventional wisdom is not settled on what the Democrats always thought it would have been telling us it would be and that is Republican massive landslide defeat\nThat doesn't look to be in the car so if you're a Democrat operative\n[noise] and the mob tactics haven't worked\nAnd in fact that you're a reasonable democratic operative when you're looking at this objectively you might make including this mob action could be\nHurting it could be really firing up Republican turnout\nAs in the post Kavanaugh period\nThere is a cabinet affected it's going one way pro Republican documented or one of these mobs when did the Republicans minding their own business in restaurants and in the airports what if these mobs attacking people aren't doing anything to anybody\nProtests and violence this was discovered by James O'Keefe it project viruses\nHillary Clinton was paying Robert Kramer to hire people to show up as Trump supporters waving swastika covered and flags\nAnd beating up people we\nKnow that Hillary Clinton has said it's not time for civility until the Democrats\nWin elections again we know about Eric Holder saying we kept them we know about Obama they bring a knife we bring a gun I've got ten pages\nListing incidence of angry Democrats committing acts of violence against Republican citizens ten pages it from a website called ...\nDot com so we've got Maxine Waters\nEncouraging all of this instability encouraging people to get in the faces of Republican elected officials and others\nIn public places like ah like restaurants [noise] apparently\nNew bombs are discovered as the day\nGoes on a apparently police forces all over the country are now on alert for a um a possibility that Obama's been sent to somebody in that community down to Florida and I'm a W washer woman show\nWhy who who have that just how

go on and we've all we've all learn who it is targeting these innocent Democrats we've all learn why\nThese innocent Democrats were targeted and probably whoever did it will be apprehended and we will find out who they are where they are why they did it who pay them or if they were not paid but the simple fact remains Democrats in America are at risk\nTo save for them to protect them vote against them\nA public service announcement from me or host Rush Limbaugh and the ... [noise]\nNow the uh the bomb here as the bombs it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise] so I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing a shaggy right\nSo Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill showing and come back here and they started sending out bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn end to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy rains is is [noise] I mean the elevator doesn't go to the top floor [noise] like to say is an order of

to an election what kind of food do something like this\n\nIf a smart bomb maker [laughter]\nIf somebody really really good at making bombs hates the left this much\nDoes he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think in all ... what's going on barring a the\nRevelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think\nI'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on your your watch cabinet blow up\nYou have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports than at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you\nAnd it is by the way it's not working\nWhat could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up or people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt to spread the hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment that's all they've got\nAnd so if none of that work if all of that backfired and ball leave me and has\nEspecially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of the worst that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do\nYou might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle\nSite real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building ... we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom ... all the polling data that they had a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave\nIf a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the Democrats are not\nRunning away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one the seats they're projecting a democratic pickup\nOf twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five and a half to two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sleep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing the generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor\nTrump's approval numbers are rising\nOn the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nWell we ... what what is old isn't decision all of a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nPolls couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it\nThen when the polls have to be shown to be correct so they still have their reputations all of a sudden it could be really\nReally close much closer than we ever ever new it's a cycle and you can print it\n[noise] [noise] they should

Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information is not out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there was never any of the country these devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers and certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they want to do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that seem out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nGoing along all along those lines if you want to look at it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis was going to be\nInstant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around\nWhat does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because\nThings are not working out the way they thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's the that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls or tell them is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nThen the things that are supposed to some men to it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention there's no way that helps the Democrats and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange\nAnd Obama folks Obama I'm ... [noise] he can't draw crowds he's out there trying to claim credit for this economy wouldn't he wouldn't know how to create in fact the Democrats are the people that have people on their side that love bombs\nBill ...\nOne of Obama's buddies and in fact but I'm not saying that there is any connection do not misunderstand me\nBut the other ... is a right on the\nMoney here Here's Mark in Orlando or as I guess in Orlando I'm In Florida right to have you here or whether it's mark ...\nMake it did U.S Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan that it's all deep state\nAnd this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... tell me 'cause I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ...\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my short of course because you can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and your watch or we're going to do Hillary and be of domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner I get my slippers that kind of thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it ... it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was already planning to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle ... came up with a good teeth and basically but it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidence is and there are no ah are you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like in conspiracy care steer but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good speech here's the theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them this is a this was a philosophy that I have a stalled for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary or Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody he can still move the needle isn't working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth from I Would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton I'm a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but I\nAmong the records released on Tuesday photos of video and dozens of text messages between give him the Democratic nominee for governor former lobbyist Adam Corey and an undercover FBI agent they appear to contradict Gillum those explanations forty expenses\nWhich have been made a major issue by his Republican rival Ron dissent is the ... campaign has maintained and continue to do so yesterday after the records were released the Gillum brother Marcus handed him the ticket the night of the show\nBut text messages at the time of the trip show that\nGillum was told the tickets came from my Miller\nAn FBI agent looking in the city corruption who was posing as a developer they've been looking into Andrew Gillum corruption as mayor of Tallahassee for years and there were a lot of Democrats are very worried that this was going to come out if he\nDid indeed win the primary fights and become the Democratic nominee which has happened the dissenters campaign\nPounds to see Republicans always ... in the media Republicans towns Democrats David but Republicans ... ...\nIt's now abundantly clear goes the dissent this statement that the Andrew Gillum\nHas repeatedly lied about taking free gift and trips from lobbyists to feel lie about these gifts and trips and lobbyists on national TV what else\nIs he lying about once a close friend of ... this Corey Feldman is at the center of the FBI's long running investigation into corruption in Tallahassee\nNo one's been charged with anything and Gillum has said that agents assured him he was neither a target and or a focus of the probe just like call me told Trump\nGillum has repeatedly giving vague answers to questions about who pay for the New York city trip is avoidance of a direct answer became pronounce during Sunday debate on CNN with the census\nAnd give them just ... and you pay for the handle the tickets now a lot of people what is the big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big\nGuy won't tell the truth about is the big ... but\nThink this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change is wrong\nIs it because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power in too positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and uh and the other thing is willingly a desirous of seeking them\nAnd it's a [noise] in in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interest and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is headed ... fifty two to forty six among the light ... voters and he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence and it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum\nWith this clear to lead as is overall edge in public polling why the ... largest level since October first [noise] okay so Gillum is a character he is a person with cloud of suspicion\nThat are hanging all over him in addition to that he is a hard left wing activist tack who refers to Florida as his collecting he looks things in the white communists and Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leads the inequality an unfairness\nHe wants everybody to get free health care here and a free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guaranteed national\nIncome these these kinds of things that if ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy\nBut who is ... is a lot of people may not know much about Ron's defenses so let me jump in here and tell\nThose of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is\n... and Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general he has a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he has resigned his house seat\nIn order to devote all of his time exclusively to his campaign has got a great family his wife or is is all in for this has got a young kid is just the\nEpitome of a decent solid American citizen who has achieved tremendous great things\nNow on TV I think you have us this morning he was on a on Fox and he very calmly\nAnd very simply outlined a pattern or corruption by Andrew Gillum he pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they set an undercover agents to catch you breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\n\n... graduated from college was given an awards by socialist organizations which propelled them of the young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of cloud or investigation ever since he won Florida it'll be a sanctuary state\nHe wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he ends the classic\nAmerican socialist who believes that America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern hemisphere is our fault because we have a hog than stolen too many and too much of the world's\nResources and we imported at all and we have denied it to our neighbors\nWilliam stolen America from the Native Americans and so forth there is nothing decent about the American founding the constitution is all\nOut David now and the guy is a classic throwback she is a walking talking Iraq Hussein Obama on steroids if that's even possible\n\nAny if you compare the current crop of Democrats can get Andrew Gillum is not unusual among the dead the Democrats are putting people like him up all over in this country and in many places they are finding the blame you heard what's happening to Heidi Heitkamp did you hear what she did\nShe just [noise] I'll tell you in a minute as time unfolds here she is down third team in her Senate race she voted against Kavanaugh\nAnd then thought she'd be able to recover some Republicans that got mad at her but she has blown that sky high she's just\nMissed judged things terribly out the details are coming up I don't wanna get sidetracked here the point is\nThat the Democrats are nominating quasar eyes socialists and and and people have problems\nWith America all over this country people think America is flawed that there is no such thing as American exceptionalism or greatness and people think that our our unfairly biased and don't know the truth of all the pain and suffering that America has inflicted on many of its own people\nMartha ... Sally Martha McSally running in Arizona she's got an arm's length of accomplishments that would be the envy of anybody\nAnd she she's being compared to this nasty bias sexual socialist is having to run against down their names cinema this is a woman running around ... ... it's been caught saying in the past that American\nWomen who become housewives or nothing but leach is an art traitors to the cause of feminists and feminism and they cannot possibly be feminists she's just off the charts senseless\nThere is nothing about the Senate my character in in terms of common\nSense that would recommend or let ... first female fighter pilot military achievements and other awards an arm's length long it should be no contest\n\nJohn James running against Debbie Stabenow John James African American another of the decent great Americans\nAnd you go back and forth looking at the race there as to whether or not he actually has a chance some days you'd think he does\nBut Debbie Stabenow now is ah been in office a long time and tired worn out classic leftist Democrat Senator who gets away with being thought\nThe coyote it was trying to kill a road runner these bombs were totally telegraph by packaging excessive posting a sorry trying to speak to fast year excessive postage taping amateur packing of gunpowder such as bad and kept as other words he says whoever\nDid this wanted them noticed wanted these bombs noticed and caught [noise]\nNever intended I'm going to be goal but never intended them to to explode or go off [noise] Paul's ferry\nHere is Bonnie in Fairfax, Virginia great to have you with us high\nHigh thank you for taking my call yes met him I just\nWanted to say that one thing I see ads for when they see their um army of people coming to our country is the discussion on what would happen if the energy state and ... and the damage and Hollywood elite put their money towards revolutionaries that country and not this one\nAnd it was just reading this pressure when he found that in the United states and the problem doesn't get solved\nA ... a ... people in Hollywood don't care about helping Honduras or not I\nKnow that goes to the Y. liberal how they want to help\nPeople know exactly how many more people would be served and help\nNo but I mean you're saying it wouldn't it be great if this all of this energy it can be focused on actually fixing these countries where these people are from\nExactly well\nThe answer would be but there is nobody cares about that\nThat's involved in this\nThis is all about the United states being the target out their body United States is the problem the United\nStates is being unfair to United States is not giving away enough money the United states\nIs not being equal the United states is not letting\nEverybody in him have whatever they want the United states is who's being mean the night\nDonald Trump must go let's flood the southern border and show he can't stop it\nThat's happening [noise] the latest on the spring of ... from the KFYI newsroom ...
