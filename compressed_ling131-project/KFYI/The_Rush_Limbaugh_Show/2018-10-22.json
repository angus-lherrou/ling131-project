I go to restaurant to go to um same waitress all the time I tried to draw hundred bucks so it was Christmas ... cool hers I Love it I took I took mine and it's oh yeah yeah\nI'm now nowhere close to judge other than fifty percent to us but I think that's the highest uh yeah I kept twenty percent minimum yeah and I'll sit more if they're really good [noise]\nIn the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me that if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America does and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't\nThink anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think puts things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats if there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump may be what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump doesn't all white the network infant didn't want it to last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you wouldn't know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared that when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them if they're not publicly saying this but I Know that\nThere may\nBe the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get it if if if if some Republicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistant Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people throwing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams of what the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border may go they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk it enough to know how\nMany miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nBut people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are real Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right as the\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so water Malala El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to the lawyer he'll talk about Jeffrey is talking to Jeff and I won't even know who these types of who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions big money isn't that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points they already\nQualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual waiting but I think this was the left\nBehind it for a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold [noise]\n[noise] the seven thousand person caravan marches on from the KFYI newsroom I'm Greg fall\nPresident Trump is

are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised\nThe stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report\nAnything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration now right mind would promote this didn't want this who won a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they've they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and four of you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how off this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived\nLong enough to know what's best for being driven solely

essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing in the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are

Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor can call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use of military because a ...\nThat normally prevent some military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military they may call as a as a Congress and the government says there but there is no law says he\nCan't this is it about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do\nStand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border that if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a a house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean you you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump since a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can't try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but on the line get them on tape bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it isn't a whole lot of different ways that will be back my friends that we will continue as we always

ears up back to the Caribbean story 'cause we're not quite through with this\n... the the the thing that that argues again for this being a Democrat Party operation\nOr an operation intended to

of illegal immigrants heading towards the U.S as an army of migrants a ragged\nGrowing army of migrants resumed march toward us read the original headline on a piece story a ragged growing army of

that week beforehand or look at those news stories about the oil level I think they're a guilt them with their strong sense of family I daddy didn't you come back to the party even though they know in their own interest the shovel public and okay\nAll right so let's let's let's walk through this\nIf I understood correctly you think that this is a Democratic Party operation because the Democrats are having problems with Hispanic turnout that happens to be true\nIt happens to be that more and and this is this is a presidential approval polling numbers\nHispanics and African Americans are rating Trump's performance higher than anybody ever in their wildest dreams imagined it would be and in pre election polls the span of vote is trending Republican more than anybody ever thought it would be the Democrats are panicking over this\nAnd so if you're right than what they've done is put together this caravan\nUm Hispanics and Latinos hoping\nShow how they are mistreated and saw that the Hispanics trending for Republicans will change their mind and not vote Republican because these people will not be allowed in where is it written\nGroup is growing larger around seven thousand people many from Honduras\nPressing on despite and the the offers from the Mexican government and threats from President Trump\nWill seal off the border before they come into this country\nBut the migrants

O'Rourke was the answer\nTo me in the origin rock rib conservative Ted Cruz ...\nHe was loved by everybody outside Texas thirty eight million dollars he raised in a quarter except there's a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping ahead in even in the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real\nAnd yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke [laughter] gonna be the guy can take a Ted Cruz\nHas anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get in that is not the kind of thing that happens with in a political party that is losing\nLosing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies you know I don't oppose this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in the in the Phoenix area\nAnd if the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going through it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be\nThey sent me a video that they took what their iPhone tennis max\nDriving along the entire line in order to make the video fit\nTo be in a size they could emailed to me they had to run it at twice normal speed and it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note this isn't just doesn't even show the people ... through the parking lots to get in\nThere was a mile long line\nOf people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know national media CNN V. MSNBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did\nIt would put the lie to the notion of the only energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these\nKinds of rallies these ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\nThe turtle and his wife are at a restaurant love of Kentucky and some mad cap asinine\nProtesters shows up and just start shouting things will turn will just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such a shame that we lost a little too and so forth\nAnd this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against on the Democratic side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into what Donald Trump rally is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures in the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture\nA seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace for the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there so you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have marched jumped through Mexico\nMan look out for those people really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you the\nThousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\nRadio [noise]\nOkay back to the phones we go to a certain voting in Macon Georgia great to have you with us on ER network I say thanks for having me on Russia appreciate your band Wilton it's great to have you here\nLike the reason why I called I spend a lot of years military are retired from the gory interesting although we are very good a lot of things we are not good at basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it\nSince Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one's perils and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving or steep poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife well my God let us\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nI think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we just not something we do that well we're you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nTo okay what about this what about just the president here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and\nThe problem that's the perilous form the problem\nWhere you don't you know like you you don't use bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nYou only have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it so we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\nBut the president would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at it they're not used to it I don't know how to do it\nThat I still got all these I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation for you to have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario than okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that maybe it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presidents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to want to tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line it probably would push or talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got to hit that it would storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI'll tell you they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met when people strike or we just have to\nEven if there is a casually or to the drive by their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd they're still peril yeah okay so the alternative is so let me\nKnow know have to hold the line and and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to eat one for the chain where you're going to do was legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that ... this is I'm a left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio\nYou're listening to the mid ...\nFive fifty KFYI KFYI dot com\nI'm pretty handy around the

President Trump has alerted the military\nOn CNN Today the chairman of DNC no no no no we we always knew this election\nWas going to be close [noise] we always you if you know the right places to look the drive by and the Democrats are really walking this back\nNow I Know a lot of you think rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost ... but they haven't this is just I don't believe this folks\nThese people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story ... all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of samples last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the when an Obama like\nWay a would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as the collective that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective he hit it would be a disaster\nFor Florida right now is well liked anybody like this guy because of what he will do in racking a growing economy do you live in Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters\n... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks he is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible news at the exact worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nUh in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott is one of these guys self made and as as a has become very successful\nAnd as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and now suddenly has become a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great defense is is a is a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump\nA but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing in it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have are exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past ... if you want to go back to flat line economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWay way stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I\nCan't I Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like Trump\nTweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt\nAt transforming America into being something\nThat it was never found it to be if you want\nIf you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me and and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited\nExtremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders\nAnd normalize them and that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed anyway\nI mean this is just hands down in this Andrew Gillum personify is personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching\nThis is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up that is one view of a ... I don't know where this was a chance to just grams of pictures here on the fly to break in the top of the hour\nThere are people standing single file on the second floor it is it looks like in the next picture you'll see the second look a high school gym\nAnd nobody's there and Joe Biden is the big draw and\nDon't be put off by this seriously it's um [noise] it it it there's it's it's not difficult and it doesn't mean that this is not a top of the line system just the exact opposite you want to connect\nThe system to monitoring twenty four seven monitoring and that's done via cellular and that's only fourteen Ninety nine a month and there are new contracts the other guys will make you sign a contract or at least two years for monitoring and chargers somewhere in the neighborhood of forty five fifty dollars but this is fourteen\nNinety nine Fifteen a month and it's it's optional you can activate it or be activated when you want but go look at all this before you do anything simply safe usa dot com is the website simply say fetch two words\nI mean no spaces on the Web address but it's towards simply safe usa dot com you will save ten percent\nThere's no offer called needed because that website as exclusively for you in this audience simply safe usa dot com now sixty day money back guarantee [noise]\nMeaning you can try this for two months\nAnd if at any point in those two months it doesn't meet your expectations or you've decided you don't like it just send it back and do refund all of your money to mom's detritus the return rate is so low it is represented\nBy an asterisk simply safe U.
