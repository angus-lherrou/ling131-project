if we were playing like the media I Would have been right with that answer because that's what MSNB\nQuestion number three so it was worth eighty nine one one hundred officers in a squadron of police drones were deployed takes place in a forty five hours standoff with a man that was blank sleeping [laughter]\nA standing on his head moaning people from his roof told me the five hour stand up one hundred officers and drones yeah he said he was pretty drunk he just fifty six sleeping tablets and doesn't when much of the incidents [noise]\nThen the cabinet or thing happened and now there's this massive caravan heading to the country with the aim of Mexico and Guatemala there nobody\nIs trying to stop this nobody's trying to stop but that's up to four thousand people now it's estimated that this is costing somebody Twenty one million dollars these people\nHave to be fed the they have to be transported me and they have to use the bathroom they have to be\nAble to drink water and whatever else they can get their hands somebody is making this happen somebody thinks that this is going to watch\nOr gr well for Democrats were told that\nGeorge Soros money is a is behind this I don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money to make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of the camera pan is the\nChildren as it always is there are children\nIn the caravan and that it's kind of like the baby on board science I always hated those I even had one major baby not on board but we're still as valuable as anybody else is inside this guys we had one of those made than those bother you baby on ...\nRush maybe on ... exactly we're in a rush maybe on board little inside that it'll be a yellow sign we made it up and it was available at the Rush Limbaugh store but this is the same thing children young children also we must do what we must\nOpen the gates we must stand decided well you must allow them passage\nSo we've got this we have the\nMuller report as I say more on that in a moment the ... report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio soundbite I have coming up uh uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd ... former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nBut who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats\nHow what it helped Democrats\n\nLet's not just Trump separating it was Trump not letting the man\nI go there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind\nOf thing is why Donald Trump was elected Donald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this was an\nOrganized bought and paid for invasion image growing\nSo obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just thick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or to separate the children from the adults so that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are\nAlready written that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan all ready in McCann where these people will say they're shocked that came to America to save their lives were their children to improve their latest they won't let the man is unlike anything they ever heard about\nThe costs of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied in three Democrats think\nThis\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically this'll be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way or am I missing something somehow a massive group of four thousand people it's growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt just making bad we obvious what it is is you're not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be playing poverty but\nThat happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't the street with its plan this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n\nI'm I'm not sure that that ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the Mueller report\nThat\nNot be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nBy the we can't do it before the election because of regulations in distance so we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is right\nThey go at once in a while I've been doing well Muller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if monitors ready to go Mahler must've found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the difficulty finely sounds I hear [noise]\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and when I look at this [noise] it won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number tens and this is\nThis is deep state ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\n\nHe's a counterterrorism center specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report and narrative if you will\nFrom all are going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only this is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there is going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictment I really want to see what's in that narrative report\nOkay so this is where is this going the Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff Trump is none none of which is probably going to be in ... none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway\nUm but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt but it's not the indictments\nWhich\nThere's nothing for it less they make it up there never has been any Trump collusion and they're never has been the evidence or less they make it up so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory\nThat blamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being so in over his head that it looked like the Russians haven't worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence it's hard to refute the idea\nIs going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence that's what it's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWhose work we have referenced many times on this program she has written a\nBook chronicling they deception and the abuse of power but corruption in the department of justice traced all the way back to the Enron task force many of the same lawyers here we're working with Mahler\nEnter headline she published this up yesterday at the Daily Caller Mahler is Jay ... is up but that's\nNot enough\nMeaning Trump still all as the country something here despite the fact Muller hasn't found anything\nThe boiler witch hunt is effectively over writes ms Powell not because Mahler and not plan to drag this out until they could contact the crime against Trump for a member of his family but rather because the ... up\nHave you noticed how long it's been since anybody even suggested that the president's sit down with the special counsel for an interview\nMueller's reason for existing was the outrageous purposefully propagandize prepare occasion as the Trump campaign and even Trump himself colluded with Russia to ring the twenty sixteen presidential election against Hillary Clinton\nThe Democrats who perpetrated this fraud or not only masters of rejection and deception they took their play book of personal destruction to a whole new level\nTalked about this whole thing with ah with handled\nIn the interview the out the genuine out rage is this that this is the ... the literal criminal acts committed by Hillary Clinton and all of the people on her team of the Obama the OJ the FBI and none of that ever investigate it and that the purpose of Mueller's investigation is to actually provide cover\nYeah I'm here I'm just working on digesting the polio soundbite Russia [noise] and we're back Rush Limbaugh at eight hundred to eight to two eight eight to [noise] um\nThere is a story here from CNBC it's it's another story about the economy here\nAnd I'm frankly stunned that anybody in the dry visors reporting this as accurately as they are us just seeing ... list rise in the household well this is according to Credit Suisse\nUm you know we now have we have the news yesterday that we have\nSeven million\nJob openings and six million unemployed observant we're we have one million more jobs open than there are people to fill

I I guarantee there's a party out there that's not happy about this the Democratic party all of this great economic news is threatening to them why would that be what about this could possibly\nMake any well question answers itself [noise]\nTalking about the Democrats [noise]\nThe governor\nWill be there from the KFYI newsroom I'm red fall governor Doug do see will join President Trump for his make America great again and\nMartha McSally political rally in Mesa tomorrow night do see is expected to make brief remarks at the rally the president is expected to arrive in the valley tonight but where he will stay as being kept under wraps if you can't make it to the rally spend friday night with us five fifty KFYI we will air the president's rally live\nBeginning at seven tomorrow night\nAnother political big hitter is coming to Arizona on Tuesday former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will be in Tucson in Tempe ahead of the mid term election the Vermont senator will join democratic candidate for governor David Garcia and others at get out the vote rallies Garcia says Sanders will help increase voter turnout\nFrom the voting population looks like the demographic population will have an idea what the true voice of Arizona is and Bernie Sanders is going to join us at both of our university campuses a phenomenal job bringing young people out to vote\nThey will appear together at Jefferson field on the University of Arizona campus in Tucson and then at Arizona State University in Tempe\nArizona unemployment rate nudged up by one tenth of a percent in September to four point seven percent but the state gained more than eleven thousand private sector jobs during the month the U.S unemployment rate fell last month from three point nine to three point seven percent\nNow look at your money sponsored by money matters with Ken rave theirself on Wall street so far today right now the Dow was down three hundred Ninety five points by fifty KFYI new stuff\nWeather center here five cents for a bus route for this off today under beautiful sunshine low eighties out there tonight fair and sixty one tomorrow\nSunny in a bit warmer the high eighties sixth Saturday the clowns rolling eighty degrees of subjects for showers right now a sunny Seventy three and Phoenix listen to live coverage of President Trump's campaign rally in Mesa tomorrow night beginning at seven right here on five Fifteen KFYI\n[noise]\n\nFinished welcome back Rush Limbaugh beating and surpassing all audience expectations every day hey let me let me zero in on the\nSituation a bombing in depth of the so called Washington Post journalist Jamal ... who's now being referred to as a lovable little teddy bear\nType guy in the New York times\nThere is and I know I went through this the other day but I Am continuing to see this is what makes me suspicious of this story folks you know I read my tech blog news\nI read everything there are\nStill people attempting\nVia they're reporting to suggest that there was a recording of the murder of ... from his apple watch\nMy friend's ... this\nIs item number one but a rousing as my suspicion about this\nThere's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this in certain Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any\nRelation any any complicity in this story so whoever\nIs behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during world record in by the show is apple watch and are now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name has been\nMisappropriated and has been falsely accused of reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is L. T. E. or cellular signals two years ago when apple in well actually uh fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they\nActivated L. P. E. cellular service which for the first time\nMade the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away\nFrom the phone and have it operated would still get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self said well you didn't need your phone nearby\n\nSo it was the first time that they they watch\nIt failed to do is just ceased to be a slave to the phone the other two ways or blow to\nAnd wife ...\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch and David can leave a watch\n\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in the car in the parking lot at the consulate there was only one way that watch could communicate with that phone\nWhile there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to his weight by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max you get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against other nations being able\nTo monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's ... ... ... that couldn't happen so he only had a way it would be why\nThat would only work if\nThe wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\nAnd the wife I connection on watch\nJust because the phone connects to why when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fi network because the phone it's parents who uses it then like if you're at home or\nYour ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you will connect to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range\nIf you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that he was probably know to do it um I don't\nKnow that they would give him the password how what do you get the password of the Saudi Saudi consummate wife signed up the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to the show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud\nIs just so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nPushing that that recording exist that it's somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish officials are doing\nEverything they can to listen to it and make decisions and the sharing of the United states\nThe fed focus their thoughts on two main concepts one being the long term federal funds rate and when there are no longer in an accommodate of posture given the lack of precision and these numbers the fed opted to remove the word accommodate of from the press release about rape that being said they view conditions in economy as accommodated for growth\nAnd should expect that growth to continue for some time into the future a couple of fed governors expressed concern for the economy to overheat requiring the fed to take a more restrictive policy stance secondly the u._k. is prime minister met with either leaders in another attempt to set the final plans for the u._k. is exit from the European Union\nUnfortunately this meeting ended and another stalemate further concerns or that a follow up meeting has not been set despite the u._k. ... at the end of march\nNearly five months from now lastly trade tensions contain away on the markets the latest step in the saga has been the U.S has withdrawn from international postal treaty historically this treaty is offered this kind of postal rates for developing nations to ship small packaged goods but China identified as a developing nation this treaty benefited the country with lower global shipping rates\nUs his departure from the treaty could result in a significant rise and the cost of small shipments from China to the U.

not readily apparent on the surface\nBut it's trying to be simplified vibe a drive by media to make it look like\nA\nTrump Administration somehow is complicit misspeak cause they will not joining the rest of the world and condemning\nSaudi Arabia for this here's an here's my mom palm pay all this morning outside the White House soundbite number one he was speaking to reporters about the meeting that they'd had a with Trump to brief him\nI've told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that the way to have a complete understanding of the facts surrounding that which one we can make decisions about how\nThe United states should respond to\nThe incident surrounding Mrs joking when I ... and met with President aired on the talk to me about the incident he told me that they were protecting their own investigation so we do believe that between these two afterwards a complete picture will emerge for what actually transpired here\nYeah so while everybody else has drawn the conclusion everybody else the Saudis dismembered him fifty and hit men showed up they caught him apart while he was alive and they got some mercy gave him some drugs to knock him out there to put on the head ... listening to music while they finish the job [noise]\nUh and that's that's what supposedly has happened to our side yet will not fall into\nEncourage him promotes the kinds of activities to blind shake was engaged in and bin Laden and so forth so it may be a distinction without a difference but as far as\nThe rest of the world can is concerned and the rest of Islam is concerned de emphasizing a reforming ... it will be the same as as as telling Christians that we're going to get rid of Christ and replace him with a transgender what they just and it's been brought that to a screeching halt the\nReforms this young friends wanted to engage him are done folks they're done because of this\nIsn't about Trump\nThe Saudis have now lost Hollywood area manual says I'm not quite given the Monday after this guy wiped out this this this teddy bear journalist Silicon Valley is running for the hills so fast you can't even see their tracks\nThis dream of a gigantic new city and Saudi Arabia built by Hollywood in Silicon valley people with all the latest tech advancements in modernization\nDad in its tracks so\nWhatever this young prince wanted to do people believed him and with this assassination of a so called journalist who's actually probably more closely tied the jihad than journalism to show me whenever this young prince wanted to do it's dead\nAnd that's the reform of why ... why hobby is not what have been tremendous if that have happened if there had been follow through but it's all been arrested now\nThe young prince says been stop dead in his tracks young prince is being blamed for this murder young France supposedly called the Fifteen hit men\nIn nursing wipe this guy out torture him nobody criticizes me yet there is no those who say well those are the kind of reforms he was trying to Institute get away from people thinking that\nThe Saudi royal family would not tolerate criticism that's not who he is is what he wants people to believe but look at what people think of it now so the Muslim Brotherhood and they don't want any part of Saudi Arabia lining with the United states against you run\nThey don't like the Saudis in the United states ally in with Israel's nobody in the in the in the Islamic world likes this Muslim Brotherhood doesn't want any westernization off any part of the Islamic world much less Saudi Arabia\n[noise] air to one runs turkey Muslim Brotherhood I mean this is who ever did folks this has been whatever else it is\nThis your friends has been stopped dead in his tracks with this\nAnd the two for I think somehow trying to link Trump to it and blame him because Trump will not immediately walk away from the Saudis Trump will not dump on them Trump will not cancel oil deals arms deals\nAnd because of that they're trying to say well you know Trump doesn't care if a guy died oh Trump ... about his arms money in oil and relationship with other rich guys and that's what they're trying to say about Trump because he um Tom pale will not immediately\nSigned on to the still unproven\nDetails of the death of ...

not do that I have no cause I'm just giving them an example here\n[noise] ah [noise] so I [noise] I Can't tell you how it went [noise] no I never ...\nWhat\nAre you in a break after it happened [noise] they bleep one thing I said they believe that I then I they told me handled it got very big look there's something you said here they've got a bleep out [noise] he told me what it was I'm not gonna tell you why should I tell you because it's not going to\nAir anyway it wasn't pro fan it wasn't insulting or anything you just took it out\nTo different Fox Russia okay fine but I'm I'm just saying folks do you have to watch it yourself what about you rushed I I'm never folks I never like myself on TV is one of the reasons I don't want to do it\nEvery time I watch myself on TV all I say is damaged I should've said acts are should've added this or should I never have that reaction after a radio show every time I'm On TV [noise]\nDamn I should've said that oh darn it why didn't I keep that train of thought going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something a little cam I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs that remember we had a\nCall here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw Trump yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well Bette camp that camp that does it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that fright\nAlso includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs\nAnd that's why yard signs without being put out I I was part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard\nSigns are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way so\nI have a video taken by Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that would have pop a pop up here just second this picture you're\nTo see us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose\nYou said that the Obama campaign two thousand twelve was abandoning the white working class as voters\nDidn't want them\nThey were too old fashioned ever to light a they were the white working class is what's to blame for this country being me\nRacist massage in mystic place than it is\nA bomb a campaign strategic we decided to become the party of every minority group that exist in the end it could be manufactured and they combine all these minority groups and that would become a gigantic\nDemocratic constituency\nSo being so large that it would dwarf anything to Republicans could put up even if they got all of the white working class well we know how it turned out Obama continued to preside over Democrats losing elections all over this country well Mr Thomas Bee and saw is back\n[noise]\nAnd this piece is in the New York times and the headlines of Democrats left turn is not an illusion just rinse all we didn't think it was\nA there is nothing [laughter] there's nothing about the stark raving mad\nAspects of today's Democratic Party that is an illusion is all\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why when the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not that illusion so they want you to know\nThey want readers to know this western is by golly by gosh for real\n\nThe sub bad like many overnight sensations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties in the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past eight years begins and Mr Thomas Bee and so the Democrat electorate has moved steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates\nSelf identified liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party raising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank and come on\nCome on up the Democrat Party elite\nSad to say we're never these radical leftists now I'm going back ... Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one or two thousand I came to share a democratic voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal he doesn't say that [noise]\nI'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderates has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next graph assist them money graph\nReady well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this site simply afterward according to Gallup the share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this gross white liberals are now roughly ... percent of all Democrats voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not been growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute into those are the level of white working class was totally go to hell now all of a sudden the white\nWomen are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is ... percent of just have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates that they had been for white Democrats so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed field lead to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn faxes Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some social issues take the issue of discrimination\nRepublican district teacher is Liz mayors have yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern\nWhen you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it and in fact [noise] [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal today written Mr certainly there's a name Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you [noise] blanche Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I Believe is the premier journalist you not was not an executive buddy practically ran the place\nI met him at Mr Buckley is home here in\n... you were good much land tomorrow was a a typical turtles which means means left and so far he's got a\nPiece in the wall Street Journal that is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump always concern is that Trump's outrageousness\nNo longer fuels anger on the left as it should just people just got used to it\nEnded up the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing that Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it she says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republican or maybe the headline is true the Republican fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case um a\nSuburban woman [noise] thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut\nThis election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past\nAnd have voted Republican know how important it I just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to it'll lose maybe holy elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it\nThey don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that and so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they\nAssume this is it dad zipped Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video then it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the hill dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S it may just not take action to stop the also this is the caravan that's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and el ... saying that they have almost no control over their population\nI'm watching the Democratic party land because they want to open borders an existing week laws I'm watching a Democratic Party led assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S\n[noise] these people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand ill legal non citizen Americans on caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for\nThis somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using\nFacilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here\nI guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey so who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date helps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop so what's\nThe calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's gotta be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe started by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats things that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump the Trump work there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\n\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp Lenny had back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waving so you're up next\nAfternoon rush hey I'm as for the Hannity interviewed\nI'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if they didn't do that in just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kim was always told me to call you I should call your call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up with South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them since they're not immunized\nAnd if you allow reform report recently yeah the new diseases out called will not a new disease is the disease out this has an outfit called ... and it's a polio like now it's disabling and also killing ...
