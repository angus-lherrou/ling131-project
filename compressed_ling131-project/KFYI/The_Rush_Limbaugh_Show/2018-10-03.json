B. I. special agent her best friend for life\n\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a lie detector test in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean\nIssued a statement the ABC I have never had an Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I've Rachel Mitchell if I have the time I I just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she can be destroyed a credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody is going to try to get past this\nOr through this with out any\nAny challenging or Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech pattern I look you know I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a voice capabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again\nArt ... gotten it out there that time\nWe'll see are especially of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this well a voice actress\nEven highly ...\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter woman on mercilessly [noise] so we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\nMerit anybody in front of a ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... even ...\nI'll talk about an attack on ... and ... and I found I live on my on my back [noise]\n[noise] yes that's correct ... ... ... ... [noise]\nYou can read like how many [noise] Glenn running down about ... ... my ...\nAnd ... that that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here be it'll be up talking at\nThe end of every sentence that fits vulnerability is its fragility almost in a way or maybe even some buddy nervous and traumatized\nAnd scared and that is exactly the a personality that I think she wanted to do FX and she succeeded with it\nAnd it's because of that but I think I don't no matter what his learned about her and how much she has\nLived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter] could blow this woman out all the water that's what I had nobody else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno a story here story there are other noticing things\n\nThere'll be a little reference to what Rachel Mitchell asked her about subject a and her answer and then they read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it\nIt it's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in that she knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph you don't know why she asking this\nWhy why do you what this is not what this is about Canada why aren't you asking her details to confirm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\n\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI\nAnd this by the way brings up or conjures up\nFBI\nFour and a has a best friend in the FBI who read ... resigned retired in two thousand six team\nA wonder how many people working on the Trump case that the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr Ford and mano McLean no matter what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as this letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she turns about six hundred bucks on\nA\nBoard was asked directly him a hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never\nRachel metro have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never remember when the question was asked I Do say what the hell was this\n\nNow Senator Grassley has been busy refuting claims made by ... and the\nOther's Grassley is on fire by the way Grassley is doing such a bang up job as is his staff here\nA grass we send a letter to foreigners attorneys telling them about the ex boyfriend seeing her coach somebody on how to pass a lie detector test\nAnd has again asked\nFor the therapist notes and the polygraph the audio visual they want to see it\nRationally and the committee wanna feed the notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see the polygraph test that Ford took and Ford's lawyer's have returned reviews attorney any of that over\n\nSo they're not being forthcoming with things that that are a crucial now Dianne Feinstein has made a move to seal the FBI investigation I think they think the case is collapsing and you know what I think\nEvidence of the case collapsing is it's New York times story on Trump's taxes\nThat's the first thing I thought when I saw that's New York times story because they've been sitting on this so long the Showtime hasn't been able to prepare a TV documentary on it\nSo Showtime which is owned by CBS\nHas been working with the New York times on this documentary on the supposedly explosive details Trump's taxes and what do we know about Trump's taxes\n\nWell it's a blockbuster story of the day the times reports that Trump's father may have left him more money than anybody knew about\nForty years ago\nAnd the Trump and his siblings set up shell corporations and phony this isn't bad style high money from me I R\nS\nThere was another blockbuster story out there today that Kevin ... wrote a letter to his college friends that they should warn

investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything's so obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has um that that but they've had them now for a year\nAnd note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do it got Trump out there they claim is mocking balls e forty wasn't mocking or walk I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my gosh\nThis is only so I don't know why president that he did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to before\nAll this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there's no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate all last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very\nCredible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed them out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should happen\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge her because it just wasn't\nSmart especially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhat an odd been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the ... she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all he did\nRepublican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin I'm covered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and to rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step\nIn it it may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times hasn't been investigating the prompt for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax\nStory on Donald Trump guess what\nOne word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for bats yet\nThey want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and then not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to they're the ones who said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a port in storage\nTrump wants to Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did was make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names and serve big fat zilch zero is not a sudden now they're on to something else now\nThey're back to what's always been said about Trump and he got rich from his dad\nClinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all of John's\nEh you never know what you got to know when you're grabbing got about ... what you want to come up I guess what you're not going to you're going to come up by women like New Hampshire gray\nThe ... not a Bill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial that it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester with confronted a a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the\nOffices in Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're\nOne of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday and she said why are you supporting Kevin ... where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester\nSo you're okay as a doctor do harm a woman Cassidy wait a second to you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy\nIf somebody's life if you destroy your life your son's life or your husband's wages to answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborated charge destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protests I Would fight and I would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what does this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told the story when I was first at this very\nYoung wet behind the year's naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds

would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump's simply voiced what no Republican senator would have these are the\nQuestions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should've been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed in her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenger she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played right along in without had Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious to what what's the purpose was\nA all\nTrump is doing is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nKristin ball the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that\nOut of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't say Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements\nInto what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat\nThem we have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did it\nGives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will treat something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than\nMoving to the rights oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what do you\nThink's really thinks it's a pattern it's a technique you pay trumped\nDeveloped I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun of things\nAnd what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've though he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage other Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hit for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\n[laughter] oh my God it was horrible we thought was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked multi for Trump didn't\nHe just said we probably she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any crop ration for what she said why you're not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nThen be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined\nCan you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell rush or a million women or nor do virtually abused well\nYeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female range\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed a made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did was say what everybody is following this\nKnows even the Democrats Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why she's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\nThe Republican Senate leader says colleagues won't be intimidated by confrontations with protesters

or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nAs one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against whoever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something could be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this um [noise] well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that\nIn their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to do that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this no idea whatsoever\nSo we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate [noise] I'd stick\nIt in in many it's not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop is rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this [noise]\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these\nComplaints Democrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they all ...\nAnd they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse\nBecause the Democrats don't fix anything and finally it doesn't even depend on\nBeing fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not now Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened\nIn public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim off record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine balls before\nI did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the time I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\nFrom Trump termed an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is and here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all\nAbout do you think that maybe the president for the other marking her like that because it gets Collins and Murkowski ended me by the way they vote or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been faked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right yeah can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have a gun adds to do it Trump did it\nIn yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee you they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and

O. D. H. D. to Phoenix and I are the radio station [noise]\n\nSanders told her first press briefing in we sense comes out swinging\nFrom the KFYI newsroom I'm Deborah Dale White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defending President Trump's criticism of Christine Blasey Ford is accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault\nTo get rid of Donald Trump to overthrow the election results of two thousand sixteen and I think Christine balls the Ford is an\nElement of that whole movement or that\nWhole desire the Democrat Party is in on it they are as much a part of the deep state as the F. B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\n\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin or what not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place\nNow saying well you know there's just many screwed it mccaskey and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heap being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken\nAfter the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer the Republican opponent the high camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out\nOr that some Republican senators when women out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words these three Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Don blamed McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would\nCave and Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to like in Cape\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp\nSo my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski but if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with your wife found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line\nWrites that a reader of theirs noted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power and wind reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic you created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it\nIs the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sordid event Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat orbit some Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt the charge here and try not try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some\nAh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents in the therapist notes\nThe incident is said to have occurred in the Mandy Nineteen eighties the when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nAnd hurt a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she sent it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that\nBefore she had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes are current as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\nAnd hurt chain\nDrink story leaves her short\nOn credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first forge testimony the assault occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that presidents should order your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people about
