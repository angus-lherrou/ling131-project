{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Man so bolus me yeah by Amazon dot com [noise] by the way going all Bernie Sanders and raising the rates for every one is giving money away his one of the leaders in advancement of development of artificial intelligence their latest artificial intelligence program was pulled because they couldn't get the program just stop doing blank\nCursing going on strike [noise] ticketing\nProcess but [laughter] yeah you know wherever I go\nI Am I [laughter] they Jack up your mind ... [laughter]\nI\nCouldn't get the artificial does this program to stop discriminating against women really spent years working on his system for automating the recruitment process to the idea was for the system to be able to look at a collection of resumes and just give them the top candidates that she said that the system decades' worth of resumes from people that they actually hired\nThey hired mostly men [noise] so this started kicking out anything that the women in them\nAnd then it was started to pull things that said ... executed or captured nothing I already told her twice\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] the reason why we're laughing because we can do the stuff that you know I I have no idea when your dog oh yeah because there is a clock on the stove\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha [laughter]\nBritish gobbled got so drunk on their honeymoon that they bought blank\nDivorced yeah that's what I was going to go if that was pretty drunk yeah it was pretty drunk but actually they bought the resort they were staying and how much was it it was actually a lease on the resort that they pay forty thousand dollars for\nDrinking twelve glasses of rum founded lease was almost up on a hotel so they decided to take it over two or three years [laughter] because our ... our friends and family think we're idiots and shouldn't be doing that because we do a lot of money after the wedding we only live in a small apartment and now we have a baby on the way how did they\nWhat's that going to prove that I well it was somebody when I'm drinking with a loan officer [laughter]\nGoing Gary Glenn row just get rid of our strong transparent ... dream and I love this play now then we're in October there like in Nineteen eighties Tom Hanks movie plots Tom Hanks gets wasted on your mind or something like that\nIt was it down in Virginia where you can find a child up to one hundred dollars or jail them for six months if they blank excessively trick or treat [noise]\nTrick or treat it all it is trick or treat it all up any person over the age of twelve showing gauging the activity commonly known as trick or treat [noise] big or any other activity similar to that are in nature to that I think it'd be fined no less than twenty five dollars and that's a one hundred dollars I agree environment in jail I agree with that and even if they're under twelve [noise]\nWe have done if they trick or treat past eight o'clock same find some penalties to we had a trick or treaters showed it probably was a Eighteen Nineteen year old kid and it's costume was just having this like twelve foot snake around his neck\nAnd I was like you should not be trick or treating and again in the panic of course like that yeah I don't want to get killed in a pound saying I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and sacrifice the Milky Way to save my family I turn on my life is all on the ... theory [noise] do you don't give out candy dollar we know all these two little\nKids come around they want to find new ones are kids my daddy ... every ... not in my neighborhood no man's land phone candy by I\nLive with Ruben guy goes district and nobody in my neighborhood listening to this show because he became Governor Robert I place asking we got here my trick or treaters dress up as red thread people [laughter]\nWe'd like some canyon or twenty percent range [laughter] my trick or treaters who are you I'm Derek ... Harris give me some F ing [laughter] because [laughter] he should go there all the way in\nI said eventually don't don't get so upset by this this is nothing I mean this is this is I'm actually flattered nobody mentioned in the piece here but he certainly was mad because he doesn't know what to do when confronted with abject ignorance like this how do you fight abject ignorance and prejudice and so forth [noise]\n[noise] and you don't you defeat it\nYou don't try to reason with it because it's impossible you defeat it I've got a chart here doesn't go well on the radio but it demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred\nYou can find that with all the charted hurricanes since Nineteen hundred you can find no significant trend in either the frequency or the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is no evidence\nThat climate change manmade even exists and there certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter because the New York times and the rest of the dry bones are offered to running cause they are hell bent\n\nOn getting people to ... and ... why what is the purpose because this promotes been government it promotes the notion of gigantic autocratic tyrannical government control over everything once you the American citizens are blamed and can be blamed for everything\nThat's wrong and you can be controlled to make sure that you you start doing things right and don't keep doing things wrong that's what they want\nThis but in the process they don't even know what they're talking about this guy does know hurricanes from thunderstorms he doesn't know cloud tops some club temperatures and it doesn't matter\nI Want to thank Mr surgery for being so sensitive in so concerned about it but I Want to assure you that these kinds of things no longer [noise]\nBother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe\nHas destroyed the futures of way too many women it has\nJust distorted the life it's distorted gender differences it has distorted the concept of happiness victim allergy it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\n\nAnd it's to and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there who is campaigning\nFor somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for ... same\nAll involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side and these so called conservative intelligentsia shock that Eric Holder was saying what he said you know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw in that when they go low meaning Republicans when they go low we get them\n\nSo people's mind God he's out there inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally I\nWas saying that we can't take it anymore we after Scott being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama method when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people to get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators\nThey're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had to pull from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe recited a poll indicated the house races are over there are poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house\nIn their minds they've lost won the Senate\nThey have the Mueller report and the mother report is going to link Trump to Russia right they know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it [laughter]\nOh say can scratch their bags with it they just can't the aid and all that Mueller has secretly collected the good they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's going to tie Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN engaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing that's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing in New York you can get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a\nTwo thousand five the drive by media proclaimed Kanye West the smartest man in pop music\nHip hop's class act the\nFiring the rules of rap Kanye West\nGoes his own way so what would I be Thirteen Years ago Kanye West\nWas the future Kanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump as his Jim Brown\nBy the white Trump was funny that Trump Trump photos and why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why do you can Trump said you know what\nYou have a point but there were people that have been a lined up for a day and a half to get into the ... I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time Trump to slam dunked him on a number of things in the short little press availability at the White House so now\nA CNN handle calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListen black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft okay but\n... said all of a sudden cognac 'cause he's put on a ... hat and he is he's an attention\nCrown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example ... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the hidden supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in\nThe Saudi royal family because it is open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nAnd hasn't been seen since\nDuring a live phone interview Thursday morning with facts and friends of president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington if he'd just trust to members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there so am I Am not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that to the this is not\nCoincidence this is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting dab in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams\nSorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise]\nThis is Trump calling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some\nWe have thousands of people lined up by the time either make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected at all by it and we had it under the great control I don't think really\nThe grocery relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president simply say look these people are lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there is nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question or from the dose\nSomebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you you better be careful what he's willing to discuss things safe and for him to make is a very dangerous day for older\nWorkers held in contempt by Congress colder when after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case\nA holder is he's got some problems\nNot used to be intelligent like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans at Wimbledon away or not even acknowledge porn or they would say\nWe strongest term oh we'd denounce rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we will kingly unilaterally condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I could he'd better be careful\nWhat he's wishing now the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring and Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would incur some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on nothing to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it\nIt flies in the face it is the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for bad people don't even leave it there believe it looking our polling\nData people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that\nThis great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans in the midterms and so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market's a roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or at four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter]\nDon't forget Obama's was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [laughter] I'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed that to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake translation\nHe is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going to grade\n\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so frightening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak\nThey leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists as they are as many financial institutions are not going to produce strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of\nDrunk so Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election was why things down so they react to it\nAnd and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I think\nThere's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nAnd your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nAnd we have great people right now are more kids\nAre there are some that I Am a not in love with us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nUrban some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not links that made up by the newspapers the media is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even the letter written to the times that there is a chance there is a very good chance that that was written by the times I wouldn't be surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear about right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person just suggesting that the times itself wrote that piece that memo that some pose a memo written\nBy an angry staffer in the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal things the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we love business\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did\nThis and they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first I Would have to go back and check the transcript\nBy then it was the first day I told everybody I don't believe this I think the times made this up I think they wrote it and they're telling us that somebody ... wrote it\nBut I think this is somebody from the editorial board the editorial staff one of the up and people this is a New York times creation I think they're that big a weird sense I think they are that frustrating I think they have tried everything worked to destroy Republican presidents and it just bounces off a Trump nothing

rejected the twenty sixteen election results\nIs this not a where he is looking back watch which retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir and the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results and Trump said no\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes we've counted the votes\nThey want it I think what was the objective was\nTo be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for the Trump won with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election of course I'm a great American yes\nThat go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win in a landslide than the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up they said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans if people got to play I'm not going to concede anything tonight\nHillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we remember\nI didn't believe in saying that this is an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until recently\nDevised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump Williams to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixty in seeing your staff for the Obama White house\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won\nThe election and Trump refused to accept the result\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate was Clinton October the Nineteen if you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would see it\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo leaves a rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating we election results so\nThis is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ... and\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were going to get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state\nIn addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell income the laser rice\n\nIn the event the Trump tried to disputed Clinton victory they would have fun result as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place\nAnd no matter what happened no matter what the outcome was they're going to use your Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that\nWas going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger he wrote she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the oligarchy she overcame rush and that's what their plan was\nAnd then it got turned upside down she'll read a last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this story\nNew York magazine they think they're doing an ad a boy here they think they're really praising Obama they are admitting\nThat there was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to
