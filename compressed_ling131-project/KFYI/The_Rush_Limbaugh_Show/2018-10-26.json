Bush was president than when he did this this guy has been out of control and out of his mind\nFor almost Twenty years almost Twenty years\nAnd this isn't now Trump's rhetoric motivated to action he threatened people with a bomb in two thousand two he's been on an FBI list for at least sixteen years\nBut no\nIt's the president's rhetoric I Wonder if CNN or anybody else is going to say he was arrested in two thousand two\nBut just you know that's according to the hill okay well a he'll report yeah well you can find the arrest records pretty easily and it'll be everywhere in a nanosecond\nSo listen I don't agree with any of it if I saw this guy's truck at an event I Would go nowhere near the van it's got pictures of people in crosshairs I don't care who those people are it's wrong but if you think that the president motivated people this you're out of your mind it's just not the case\nSo um what we're going to do\nIs we are going to end our week we're just about out of time we end our week with our national anthem we do this to pay tribute to the men and women that are acting as first responders in our community and the men and women that are serving in our military and the families that are supporting them this is an honor for us to be able to do that we thank you so much for your service but especially today\nFor the great work of the Federal Bureau of investigations are much maligned agency because of bad\nActs by their leadership but this shows you the professionalism of the men and women in the FBI and law enforcement across the country great work today by them and congratulations for making this arrest or keep it locked here for all the coverage of what's going on I'm On behalf of the show I have a great week every one God Bless her\nHead knees\n\nNa na na\nNa\nNa ...\nWhose moms and right\nOh hey\n\n\nFifty six AM seized his white van which had pictures of Trump and the presidential seal plastered drew a window\n[noise] [noise] um [noise]\nAlso have something sense to me here said that he was um\nFrom Avon tour a and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two\nAh income information pending what does this site can't tell what the site is it it's a [noise]\nAny weight identifies when as a member of the Green Party a yeah he's got pictures of Trump and he's a GOP stickers all over the uh\nThe window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients\nBy the way our Cory Booker the New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab\nTo study them they had to go ahead and detonate them blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off\nNone of them if they were ever intended to they may still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on and\nUntil a law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concern that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America great again a great again bomber mad got bomber because it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up\nAt the people Trump is that this is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions\nAre what are matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we haven't GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting\nThat economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the at the British in three point eight to four percent is\nGuess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also it on his alphabet and Amazon half reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in and saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections\nAnd what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still truck getting right along with the drive laws are reporting the day that it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from\nThe media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump to today complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics\nVery unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote\nThat's his tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou might guess his I sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news and what is it\nAnd if there isn't any news about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it ... the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a\nPool here today from strategic good teachers strategic [noise] in the poll Ron ... Santos has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable Paul it's a big deal\nAnd so the ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this\nAnd it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does affect what people think their their perceptions\nOf ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is ah is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I say it's a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling from a false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for them in terms\nHis tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper went to\nTrump's tweet while someone nonsensical really help to know who wrote this suggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to to to to cover up any news or anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans at Trump for being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um it'll make it make it appear like the Democrats are\nBehind this and it will just have to let time unfold on this ... this is a little frustrating trying to say they're getting all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself and I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just going to be patient\nThe press like the Russians could be behind it because it just struck tons of view of this whole thing was bound and determined to help a\nPresident Trump which means the Russians would have been but it's just\nThe way people think amazes me is always\nOne\nIs arrested in connection with the wave of mail bombs from the KFYI newsroom I'm Greg Paul the ban is identified as fifty\nSix year old Cesar ... junior speaking at a White House event today the president said federal agents have done an incredible job\nWe will prosecute them him her\nIt may be\nSaid of the law\nIn telling the mailings despicable the FBI finding an eleventh and

electric companies to get fifty percent of their power from a new sources by twenty thirty\nAnd army troops are expected to be heading to the U.S Mexican border to stop a migrant caravan of father from Mesa is protesting those caravans\nSteve running back son was killed by a man police believe was in the country illegally when he was gunned down for a pack of smoke running backs says he'll be

being ripped to shreds [laughter] [noise] um\nNow be because of the stickers all over ... stylish white van the a drive by media are concluding that he has a right winger\n\nHe's a right winger and he is a Trump loving and deranged individual\nNow according to Florida voting records he has a registered Republican full name says are ... and his party affiliation as of march\nFor two thousand sixteen was Republican Party\nAnd he's a been active as a registered Republican since March fourth of two thousand sixteen um and as his voter status is um is also active now that information is from heavy dot com to claim they got it\nFrom the Florida voters search site which they might have done but they would have had to know his birthday to get it\nUh we don't always birthday so we can't double check the claim here\nSo this this stuff just happened to happen to write as the program is beginning I have a lot of data you know is a highly influential a major media figure I have all kinds of people trying to influence me what what I'm saying flooding lose on with things they want me to repeat\nA now say I guess the Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines but they're calling him Native American I and again and flooding in his own here with the with the information for you that as as I receive it [noise]\nUm [noise] and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind that's what's making first impressions\nAgain I Can't emphasize that uh [noise] the enough\nNow the drive by having the stop their coverage and have joined the\nPresident Trump\nThere is in fact I listen to it a little bit of ourselves he's got a big powwow headed up there in\n... for the media thank you very much I thought I'd do that and uh we feel very strongly a again congratulations to all law enforcement we're the best in the world and they just showed and thank you very much\nFor young black leaders of the White House [noise]\nNow to the subject at hand [laughter]\nTo be with so many brilliant and that's what you are brittian courageous earned yet again proud of them are\nMuch about it is because he's not getting on to the ... the the real meaning of a reason for the meeting there which is unprecedented by the way up state leadership committee of hundreds of young black leaders are in America that are gathering at the White House has been a lot of ... about this\nI guess the president made and acknowledgement to law enforcement for their great work and tracking down the bomber\nAnd bringing that story to a to a conclusion and we were rolling on it and whatever he said that was relevant we will pass that I'll say I want to grab the phones get started berets open line friday and I know you want to weigh in on this\nAh so are we going to start a just as if we have the ability you don't have the ability to give them\nOkay Jimmy and all the hubbub Rascoe we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jeremy and all my heart rate to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I was gonna say in advance I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical\nTowards the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about\nHow you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there is no red ... I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\n[noise] and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think a real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that Feisal document and ... and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the ... I think this package bombs are means of disrupt the elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these nationalist right groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the wind and the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the hoping into turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state they are going to lose they're not going to win the house back Democrats than the deep state they're not going to win the house\nBack not going to win the Senate back so all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws or that they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... your ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy up or even he's part of a flag operation\nDesigned to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated if you think that\n... that impacts animal spirits ... were actively engaged with clients as we work with them through this volatility\nThanks Michael your path through investment advice starts with your ... financial advisor find yours at ... dot com that's S C I F ... dot com steeple Nicholas\nIn comedy incorporated member ... bc and head why se [noise]\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older naturally begin to change causing a lack of ... or even trouble over three calls [noise] thankfully the breakthrough in President how your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in ...\nIn clinical trials can happen selling can improve short term memory can help you brain better life Mm valence toys everywhere\nStatements and not being evaluated by the FDA this product is not intended to treat short or prevent these [noise]\n\n\n\nReadings welcome back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal evolution\nTo Alex ...

I. B. L. E.\nS. [noise]\n\nYes\nYes yes books I'm I'm I'm not just viewing everything I think the moment I think I'm collecting some thoughts all share with you my latest on all of this when we get back after the break your topic this man this guy was driving around in\nThis is just odd it's just weird [noise]\nWhen you try to plug it into the rest of the events used dogs five fifty KFYI Phoenix Jay y o da de do Phoenix and I are trying to go see\n\nA Florida Man has been arrested for the suspicious packages from the KFYI newsroom I'm Greg Paul he's\nFifty six year old geezer say a junior and he said to have a criminal record President Trump talking about the mail bombing arrest during a young black leadership event at the White House\nNow I\nI don't know that any of my thoughts your immunity obviously I'm just\nSharing with us some of the thoughts that I've had that I and I ... process but you know I just didn't work these out when I first started noticing this stuff but let me go to audio somebody's number twenty six we have there there is a CNN sucks sticker on this man's\n[noise] [laughter]\nHe goes to the post office kiosks whereabouts are cameras\nTo mail they use these bombs none of them went off\nAnd from what I'm told for reliable law enforcement none of them could help now there was also a story out there that some of them are so unstable that the law enforcement Heather detonate them rather than transport them into the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia you know these watches excuse me so I'm OK I'm OK\nI did not fall you know these new watches have fall\nDetectors on him I mean if you fall if the watched detect that you have fallen it will offer to call emergency services for you\nIf you're incapacitated all you have to do is do nothing if you do nothing after a certain number ... it'll\nCall us a call nine one one where you are it also gives you the opportunity so no I didn't fall I'm fine I'm OK this thing goes off on me twice the show while I'm sitting here\nMy wild jak sticky operations my expression field manner of speaking as drinking my watch triggering my watch into thinking that I Am boiling the bike and got up\nIt starts vibrating not you know what this is a great help me driven a lot of people are buying this watch\nFor grandma and grandpa because it does it work they've ... they've tested this watch on Hollywood stumped actors and stunt men and women and it works but it's also it shows it nothing wrong with is comes back with false positives but I'm ... my\nHand than even hit the table at the it just wildly just sticky waving around to her in my fall\nAlert has been triggered him to watch that is what looked at her up to me but my my point is it this guy here\nHas been screaming notice me and now here comes Dana Bash from CNN justice after the CNN sucks sticker on this man\n[noise] CNN sucks [noise] here we go\nImage stand in tax [noise] of course the president and direct that he's not technically of responsible for that but he is responsible for not just allowing the chance than I'm stuck at his rally but stoking\nMaking clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years and looks like one may have emerged and that is the danger and that is the reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you could have political discourse but when you cross the line\nIt's extremely dangerous and that has what as thin giant mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs\nAnd you know in a\nIn a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger\nThat at one of their crackpot view or is this going to take action except the theory is crackpot CNN viewers shut up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have an example after example of attempt\nIn violence against conservatives and right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely threatening people\n\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\n\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN can getting any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there's says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making I'm insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair biased coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people will see an or find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him and a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about them if they did the miss characterize them damn attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun in a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics\n\nBecause the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter so wait chalk it up where of course yeah I was\nAh mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody comes down to\nTrump\nA lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make a ... I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply ... and I'm Talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgments over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam\nFrom having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted\nTo decorate in dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over the top [noise] this is what you would do\nSo [noise] my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he\nConvened a meeting black Leadership Conference\nA young black leaders from all over the country this has not been done before in in this in this manner um [noise] and he's talking about the arrest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody [laughter]\nCredible job by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I Want to again remind you of Trump pacing if if if you think Trump is not\nAs on point is is your baby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... foreign showed up\nAt the ... at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible\nI really hope that she continues to testify I think what happened or happened in Kevin are maybe ... that's what he said at the beginning and he did it gets himself on record just being proper in the proper way to look at it which frees them up to express what he really thinks later on his things unfold\nSomething else in in the remarks made by President Trump he was very gracious tort law enforcement he was very gracious toward the work done to bring this vile this gusting make America great again bomber\nTo justice\nAnd I I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators and the drive by media over the edge\nDriven over the edge by Trump doing for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity you might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there's going to be a panel on CNN or pee MSNBC her son leftist on Fox in a call Trump like total front calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the chaos and division\nThey will say that Trump was on believable a brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the old Limbaugh the room the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which were rock Obama\nActually got to pretend and portrayed himself as on involves getting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up [noise] um that's the Limbaugh fear on the Obama effect not respond us we're going to they're going to accuse Trump\nBack in the second [laughter]\nPipe bomb mailer under over\nFrom the KFYI newsroom and decker Dale officials have identified the man arrested in connection to the string of pipe bomb packages\nAs fifty six year old ... junior from even Torah Florida just outside of Miami speaking at a White House event today the

with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive\nWhat I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest important our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division and our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico [noise]\nBut but and I I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today [noise] a threat of this go end of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder\nAnd today's arrest is a testament\nTo the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab in Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nThat requires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort in getting those devices to our lab from around the country and we can confirm\nThat Thirteen IDs were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe a small clock\nA battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet an energy there were a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelopes containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that the seas are say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure under an incredibly tight timeframe we see unbelievable work like this on TV and Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab\nFor their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert\nEvery to try to keep the American people safe from harm and who move quickly\nAnd efficiently into action every single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages\nIn transit now and other packages on [noise]\nSo we need the help of

eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips dot FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every tip could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nOf protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans now I'd like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from then why did you [noise]\n\nThat Chris after every one of the men and women are\nThe NYPD quite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to commend to thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement partners in this effort including the attorney general's office and us attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives alone with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorism task force\nThe J ATF for New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to terrorism in New York City in YPG doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger\nHis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service in it or we sell bureau or counterterrorism bureau or patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest\nI couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset we would identify and the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts\nAnd I think he like every American is and should be proud of the unbelievable work was done not just by the FBI but by all of our law enforcement partners across multiple states\nIn this I think commissioner O'Neill set it well the partnerships that exist in a law enforcement profession right now in this country are are extraordinary are better than they've ever been and it's the ... what the doctor ordered for this country this pass\nBy the\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions FBI Director Christopher Wray answering questions after announcing the rest of the man they believe is responsible for sending at least a dozen or as many as Thirteen or fourteen what were described as I eat these explosive devices to\nFormer President Obama or other prominent Democrats as well as the one that was delivered to the uh Manhattan offices of CNN that a suspect identified as fifty six year old Caesar say hockey is now charged with five crimes including mailing explosives making threats and assaulting federal\nOfficers in faces as many as fifty eight years in prison and according to the attorney general Jeff Sessions who says he could also face additional charges\nA warning or other ... would be um a offenders that the Justice Department will bring the full force of law to anyone who brings threats of violence the further and agenda or we learn from the FBI Director Christopher Wray as well\nA vet the FBI was able to recover a fingerprint on some of these packages and also has potential\nDNA evidence that helping to identify a this suspect again identified as Caesar say aka fifty six year old a resident of the Miami suburb status where he was arrested this morning a van that was covered in political bumper stickers\nWas also towed away by police again Caesar say Iraq under arrest it the FBI Headquarters in South Florida charged now accused now of sending off more than a dozen of these explosive devices I'm Jared how for and in Washington this is Fox News radio\nReverberating have hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need to decide the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN poll\nAnd it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen but forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest and also forty\nSeven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating twenty tended terms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\nThis there's certainly a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago it seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president mid term but how many\nSeats the Republicans win in two thousand ten mid term some of the three\nThe Republicans one sick the free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out\nConventional wisdom is the party out of power makes big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but ... point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here at the and a bit of an upset\nThere's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this if it ... your ego\nBarely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron dissent is pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum a cotton is thing operate in ... I Am reading by the way\nThat it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated formed\nA we had the news that he had he paid an Under Cover ...\nThe money to buy handled and tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails texts raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new wells advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Curry could help him network with power for developers businessmen and the lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald\nIs a it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there's a Politico story today I actually saw it last night that Trump fear is a foreign to wipe out that Donald Trump\nFear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win\nEverything and so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political star and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs drugs has links to them that are the socialists of America appear ready to win and dominate and convert America after long\nLast too committed socialist policies so you find these stories all over the place [noise] about the intention of voters this ah this cycle\nAnd how they're faring the Charlie Cook report the vaunted inside the beltway analysts who take a look at every\nElection inside out with the election just eleven days away now it seems that the overall Senate playing field won't change much although what appears that some of the races in toss up are getting even tighter\nThat says\nIt's getting more difficult to see a path to the majority for Democrats with Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp heading for defeat in North Dakota\nDemocrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority be one way would be to hold the five Democrats seats and toss up and pick up three of the four Republican seats in toss up\nIf you read the book report I'm not going to bother telling you which ones those are but that's how they analyze the bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has been moved to\nToss up in the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be deadlock Democrat any day of the year that you look at it New Jersey being in in toss up\nAnd Florida remains a coin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better he's the incumbent he would have the\nPath to victory in Montana between Jon Tester the incumbent state auditor Matt Rosendale that racist tightened tester maintains an advantage that's either just within or just outside the margin of error there is an addition to the top ... columns but race in New Jersey\n[noise] that\nLast segment I must lost track of the clock

working with\nThe guy ... co conspirators ... is there somebody that has been working on this guy for some period of time inspiring it motivating revenue him up I mean there's so\nMuch that we don't know yet and we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is despite\nAll of that there is enough information to glean simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today\nAnd you add that to what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the the deep state not ... the Democratic party\nSee I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years on this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous\nWhat has been done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a targeted not literally trying to set up Trump employees staffers and so forth\nSets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall\nPapadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was hounding Trump or your advisors who is obviously goes out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name Stephan helper\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails no I don't know that stuff on August twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big\nSo they told him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London and the ambassador\nTo step in offices you know I told the we we know that the Russians have all the Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head\nHe didn't know it independently because it probably isn't even true so Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails\nAt one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation will get the Pfizer orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back we don't even really understand\nWe think we do but we don't have any idea these people have and entitlements to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to we can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother and but this whole two years silent who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever find out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared\nThat's another reason why Hillary had the wit and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up for the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion without well\nIf I Believe all of that to be true and I do", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show",
