[laughter] I'm Sorry we condemn the use of bombs as political tools on this program we never had been in favor of it I just want to reinforce here\nThat we can damn they use the bombs we can damn violence in politics there's no place for it\nAnd they're literally is no place for placing blame when when nobody knows who actually is responsible for this [noise]\nUh back to my point it takes it takes some expertise here to manufacture bombs like this it if it's true that they're not intended to go off\nAnd if it's true that there are meant to look crude and made by people started in the movie deliverance it tanks bomb making skill to put together bombs like I mean these bombs mail bombs have timers on him\nWell their mail bomb any bomb expert knows you don't put a timer on a mail bomb\nA mail bomb is designed to go off when it's open you put a timer on their ... strictly for visual effect because every bomb on T. V. has a timer\nRemember we are at TV ingrained society and what we see on TV we tend to believe that for bombs are featured in many TV shows and movies and every bomb has a count down timer on it\nSo these due to except they're not acting they're not turned on and not counting down and they're not connected to anything they're just there for show\nThe stamps\nHave not been cancelled I mean this is as though they would have progressed through some\nSort of standard procedure at the at the post office but why am I why might the drive buys think that Republican momentum has stopped why might they think that\nThere has been a a slow\nDown well it's possible\nThat\nThey see the shift in soap opera narrative coverage every day from the invasion the caravan Kavanaugh the economy the Trump rallies all of that stuff is gone none of that stuff is being reported or talked about at\nAll and those were the things that we're talking the talk of Republican enthusiasm not to mention all the polls and\nNot to mention the story is on the on the slippery away blew away\nAll of those stories are gone now every story that dealt with them in terms and those stories had shifted toward Republican momentum all those stories are gone now and pretty much every story has to do with the show he\nAnd the Turks and the Saudis on the bombs\nAnd how Trump's not Trump's gotta learn to shut up Trump's got us he's got to stop stoking emotion like this I mean they're blaming Trump for this from beginning to end but if you're in the drive by media and all those other stories\nThe caravan slash in Beijing the Kavanaugh aftermath the economy which is a fabulous story and the Trump rallies if they are not news\n\nAnd the only thing that is news is the bombs these mailed devices\nThey've taken all of that other stuff off the radar so that Dr buys reporting this stuff may feel like\nThat the enthusiasm for the midterm elections protecting why only on the Republican side by the way\nWhy only Republicans do they must be because that's where the enthusiasm was\nI mean if there is a significant sea change in voter enthusiasm and the drive by going to report that it's Republican enthusiasm is tapping down then it must have been Republican enthusiasm that was very high on ratcheting up so now they're saying enthusiasm has waned it's Republican enthusiasm\n\nSo they are in their media capitals are in New York and there in Washington there in Los Angeles they're reporting this stuff and in their world the midterms are off the radar in their world\nAnything to do with them in terms and well not off the radar it's a very important point the enthusiasm on the Republican side they see us having vantage why because there aren't any stories about well yeah they determine what stories are covered in what stories are not they determine what's reported and what's not\n\nNow at what point will be mailed device story from the southern jungles of Georgia said\nWhy [laughter] why are you laughing in their\nCome on you know as well as I Do that that I Know\nThese people like I Know every square inch my fault prison like glorious naked body I Know how they think I Know what they're

we don't even know if this is per se or a perp we don't know if it's a Russian government agent or operation we don't know who is behind this whoever it is doesn't know how to spell Florida\nOr whoever it is is not sure how to spell Debbie lab or mouth shows his name now the drive by maybe they don't know and right now they don't care they have a story they can only dream about and they are running with it\n\nAnd have you ever have you ever seen the media less interested in finding out who the purpose if you watch this carefully\nYou don't see a lot of curiosity about that just the fact that they can do banner headlines Trump targets receive bombs or whatever it is is plenty enough for them must take a brief time out we've got a great audio soundbite roster\nAnd a much else coming so

Smith\nWe're hosting a roundtable out there was that there was a three women\nWe had Republican National committee spokesperson Kaylee Makin Amy a\nBustle dot com head of research Jessica tar love I I refer to her affection Italy is Natasha on top\nAnd Washington Free beacon a senior writer Liz Harrington they're talking about the ...\nThe package bombs these these uh mail order devices that are not exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer\nStarts off I go into Kaylee Mac in any case I mean what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nWhat I've observed a president who didn't leadership he condemned the attack he called for unity of response from the liberal media to then ... the president\nAnd they should instead of blaming the president to take a cue from the president's\nLeadership yesterday called for the country and come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time stand behind the president shameful I Will add that the New York times today tends to publish an article tend to pick the fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from me that I can deliver inhouse him for the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't\nKnow named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun does that go off and so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine\nThe times runs this story and they excuses by saying well we must publish stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump and put what does that got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching\nTo us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back and Donald Trump needs to change it Donald Trump didn't\nMeanwhile they can call him and not sitting call him a Hitler or they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controls ten thousandth ethic I'd laugh at it has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be presidential which is essentially saying to the audience you know what I'm thinking and then this morning we'll trade and that it was CNN fall\nWhich basically is I can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing shorts cart has been completely ... saying that CNN and was responsible for the fake news that they're spreading the ... fault but the arranged maniac that offending does I\nHope it will let me just adding van and that's why he want to be on the record and then a python showed up and not culpable\nFor in the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth and then you had an anchor on that network endorsed the play and Central Park to pick the me assassinate the president saying that\nThe only right now you heard Natasha on top\nThey say you really you you want to be on the record\nSaying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about never see it's a good like\nBlaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation\nContinues here now you'll hear the senior writer for Washington Free beacon lose Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than ... than a thousand things for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal for anyone in guiding fellow at about\n... what about the language in Atlanta and I every time than heroin\nIn Santa and had a choice cats are day he saw the president announcing his abhorrent to white America stand for what ... what is the un anxious to tell us can blame that on the president can glean from Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move at Fort Larry Flynt forward at fighters have helped the low road President Trump that the highlights what Clinton said last week they cannot have civility\nWhy we cannot have civility [noise] so what your hand here yet on a top actually trying to blame all all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this\nI'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears you're just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is being\nInterviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to bite your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who are legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter you know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the rule is here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God alive Phil Donahue your sitters all the time Phil Donahue and hosts the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he would be he started preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it look different it's made for me and if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt\nOver how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was to want to other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\n\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world they answered the solution is to spread our area of dominance influence and to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but there are way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others and that we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants to him in\nBecause of our guilt and\nHe says uh you know it did their Marjorie nor is it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nInto a reported kidnapping ends with first degree murder
