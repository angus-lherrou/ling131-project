publicly disagreed with the right\nSo you're saying she ...\nShe believe both the foreigners he was right just laying there than offended over the white Trump treated mostly foreign than the cabinet gets confirmed that she can't handle it anymore now we don't know I'm just\nPointing out areas where she's publicly disagreed with the president\nPoppy Harlow had no idea what she was talking about nor did anybody I don't want this is a classic example of they found out Nikki Haley I'm going to be approximate what the time here they found out that Nikki Haley was going to resign at ten o'clock and for an hour cable news had nothing but speculation as to why they couldn't just wait\nThey couldn't just wait for the announcement in the video tape from the oval office where she in Trump presented the bright yellow chairs by the fireplace couldn't wait no end to fill that time was speculation and that's when people really get dumb when all kinds of wild guess speculation\nThat's where people try to show their smarts folks the ads were all these animals\nAnd commentators tried a demo there in ... status and their operatives knowledge and so forth some of the things that I heard being bandied about\nSimply made no sense but much of it as they say made for great TV [noise]\nIt wasn't complicated at all she just wanted to leave at nothing to do with Kavanaugh it had nothing to do with ... and had nothing to do with the Supreme Court it's simply had to do with the calendar and something she had said this was going to happen long ago\nI in terms of the um\nIdea that she's

she just didn't didn't kids and it and it's going to run for the Republican nomination\nIn twenty twenty\nSo she headed that offered the past before the press even started asking questions is no I'm not running in twenty twenty and the only thing I'm going to be doing is campaigning and supporting this guy and she pointed at Trump\nYou good to hear about when they come out of the sales collectively of the drive by media who were convinced\nThat a woman was abandoning Trump because of ... because of capitalism\nHere's our bunny nic Robertson above all maybe all time favorite CNN foreign correspondent and here is a nic Robertson this morning on CNN I'm guessing back and forth with the info bay poppy Harlow about Nikki Haley's reason\nOn the issues that allies have wanted to see President Trump to be tough on a particular Russia because science woman he seems\nTo be sensitive on on not one that wanted to push as allies in Britain and France and Germany [noise] ah the whole thing states have oil once it into vindicate Haley has been a source of conflict so if you're one of the United states enemies and Nikki Haley steps out of this position than perhaps your brain a tiny bit easier\nI looked [noise] I\nI'm just I'm just a radio talk show guys here and Nick Robert so does this season broadcast journalist but I'm Sorry this is so full of its let's go back to the top of his soundbite on the issue is that our lives if one of the street Trump be tough on in particular Russia\nBecause that's the one that he seems to be sensitive on and not one but he's wanting to push\nAs allies in Britain and France and Germany to booming states have all wanting to be tough\nHas every button it kept you forgotten how Trump re ... Angela Merkel for making a deal a side deal at the G ... with the Russians\nHave forgotten that it was Donald Trump who was tough on the Russians ended it was Angela Merkel omega psi deal with them for natural gas\nAnd it was Donald Trump that could not believe in and called her out on it and suggested that she couldn't have purchased natural gas from any of her allies in the G twenty the G ... Fifteen or the G whatever\nTrump has been tough on Russia to the extent that the people promoting a Trump Trump Russia collusion story had been discredited thoroughly Trump has not been a Russian puppet quite the contrary but you wouldn't be able to convince nic Robertson of\nThat one oh they got these ideas in their head trumping on Russia's got together they stole the election remember Hillary Trump is a Russian storage Trump has money because the Russians sought to what Trump falls Russia because of that Trump therefore soft on Russia\nNow Nikki Haley is leaving and that means nobody's left to be tough on Russia and our allies are scared to death as a total one hundred percent front to back top to bottom crock folks\nGuarantee our allies\nAre probably happiness he Nikki Haley go because she is tough and she is pro America she believes in America first just like Trump does not to the expense or at the expense of our allies you once your body brought along but\nShe's not a push all these people don't know what you're talking about\nThey get these notions in their hands these fantasies armies narratives as they called them and they are reality whether they\nTouch on the truth or not here is Trump and Haley with her resignation announcement in the bright yellow chairs I got emails today from people God I hate those chairs rice you got to tell them to get rid of the chairs I said are you telling me that's what you notice here\nYou're watching Haley resigned and Trump sitting next door and I got a great pressure going and you're telling me the chairs or to yellow\nThat's what makes me think we've got no prayer we got no hope we have a serious thing going on in the oval office when I get emails all my God the chairs rush\nChairs\nThat was the way no chairs on radio folks because no pictures except those that are\nIntricately paint for you with my clever use of urban diatribe rhetoric and residents here is a is it that soundbite\nNikki Haley that's the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person very important play but you also is somebody that she has been [noise]\nThe United nations from the beginning with us from the beginning and work with us on the campaign is really a long time very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year the end of the two year period at the end of the year [noise]\nI Want to take a little time off I was little so we're all happy for you in one way to lose sales company over to come back some

coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing political arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the limitation of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limits on how low they will go on how ... have been perverted they will be in seeking their reality in all I Am convinced started on America's college campus well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this\nThe most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to\nGet people's attention or whether it's because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nI Am so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my thoughts [noise]\nBut they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes ideas they're not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy discussion or acknowledgement\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert and it was\nAll on display in a capital hearings everything that we are up against the abs since ... presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThat and that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court the rest of it the history on it but child like wailing immaturity is the result of the\nPart art

age twenty eight point margin in the sea and the and poll and that's not how it was supposed to be that's not what people were supposed to conclude people were supposed to conclude that Kavanaugh is an fit\nThe capital has no business being a judge anywhere much less the Supreme Court that cabin on needs to be destroyed justifiably so that's what people were supposed to realize that that's what mid term voters were supposed to agree to punish anybody who would try to voice\nUs this week about miscreants like capital on the country but it didn't work out that way\nMore on this of course but let's go to the phones will start the nation's capital Washington DC this is Sandy I'm Glad you called Hi\nI Am so pleased to talk to you rush thanks for taking my call\nI watch uh the president Nikki Haley this morning I think Nikki Haley could tell the president a few months ago of her plan I think today was deliver it on the hill says Cavanaugh I think he's got somebody in mind\nHe's going to announce that person before the election and what does it drive by the Democrat's gonna do\nThey're going to start fighting oh we can have this person well this is terrible and then what's going to let the election people are going to say it's not going to stop we can't allow the Democrats back in it\nIsn't going to stop whether the Democrats win or lose this\nIs the point you're right but it isn't ever going to stop until these people are so soundly defeated and become\nSuch a a very small group of people even then they're not going to stop it ... the Kevin Oh things not the end if anything the camel thing for for ... as far as most people are concerned the way you need to look this is the beginning this is the beginning of the white it's gonna be for as long as we allow it to be done to us\nThat's right\nAnd and you're right they're going to try to poke holes that whoever Trump's nominee for UN ambassador is I haven't heard any names I haven't paid close enough attention to know who the names being bandied about might be\nBut they're going to do it on principle they're going to do it because they think it'll be a political advantage headed in the mid term showing once again the world but country doesn't think Trump is justified and qualified to be naming anybody that this was or should he doesn't he doesn't deserve to be president we need to get rid of it and this is the whole\nFoundation for which they are going to be have a anyway the question is does this her them or help them and not with their base I mean we know their bases is driving this\nBut with others\nThere's all this never ending obstruction and personal destruction\nNominee after nominee after nominee will say a appreciate the call Sandy use of of being out numbered one of us living in Washington in ... she was ten percent of the population that's not\nDisease and we\nAll this stuff in and just three hours a day\nTed Cruz is leading bet hall or work fifty four to forty two\nA ... point lead Blacksburg with a fourteen point lead in Tennessee in Nevada Dean Heller has a three point lead\nEat over his Democratic opponent rows and now these are Senate races it's interesting in the CNN polling data the generic ballot I I'm just going to tell you don't get dispirited by this because it's it's a it's it's CNN\nBut on the generic ballot in a CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground but in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening now to plus Thirteen\nThat I I just I maybe it's my desire maybe it's my hope but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus on the west the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of balance that it makes sense that way\nI just I I find it really hard to believe\nThat after the last two to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent wants to Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\nI Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThat the first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the Jim this is standard operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of auto elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six was an election certainly to the exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially I and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are they answered a what ails America\nNow the dry buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen margin advantage but then you\nLook at individual racism and nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise] and then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents\nDisapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by twenty eight point margin\nEven though the Democrats on the surface was seemed to have public opinion on their son says the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved\nOf further breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independence disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compare to thirty percent who approved other\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by a narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independents disapproving everybody did it\nYou know big ... [noise] I\nCan't prove anything all I have to go on um experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct\nI just I don't I everybody believes this blue way if it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links links to on his page is a story of\nThe Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\nWhere Republicans supposedly things the same thing is going to happen\nCertainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what what [noise]\n[noise] well yeah I'd like to get an individual polls show nine percent of the nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the into the new show I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm One of these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\n\nAnd I'm sure you\nFeel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the\nWay we do for a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this\nTrump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interest in\nAnd would always say a variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just ... rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to get all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous as they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds Obama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen\nHillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the albums\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death while they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in Trump with his airplane perfectly placed\nSo that Trump in giant letters and the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas [noise] so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy\nIn the meltdown that is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are so so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital\nAnd Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all [noise]\nVery quickly [noise] surprise resignation from the KFI nice reminder for Dale us UN ambassador Nikki\nHaley plans to exit at the end of the year

this is what you were just telling me right now you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their office is telling you they believe this okay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart\nThere are two hundred nine seats\nFirmly or leaning Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSo\nTwo hundred seats firmly are leading Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this\nIs a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of\nFor this to

think there's gonna be an Alan ... anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\n[noise] two hundred nine feet firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question\nWhat could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything\nOne thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this guy with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed there just go for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans\nAll right\nWell as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that it's getting harder
