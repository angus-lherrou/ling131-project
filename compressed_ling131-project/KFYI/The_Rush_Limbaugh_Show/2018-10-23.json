don't misunderstand I'm not I'm not\nI'm not\nIgnorant about this I Know that a unified every day I'm told they have a theme that they have all unify behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stalks fears head of election I thought of when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic Colorado graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nA hand of election this caravan thing you know I [laughter]\nI continue to study this\nAnd try to pick it apart bill analyze it and and make sense of it\nFrom a political standpoint and I still can't find anywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it's\nFact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately poor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland and that's not an oil what they are they are part of an organized\nMob there is no question about this it is an organized mob and like everything else and the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned to how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how bad was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic is all structured it all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped it's poll tested and from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious there there's no if you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nIt ought to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm of it\nWith seven thousand people that maybe a thousand or a ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks if they're walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have\nTo be being driven but it is all\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking from Honduras\nTo the United states that just didn't happen and it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\n\n... obviously is a bunch of left us to set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it isn't it's not a caravan it's a mob it's bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on his massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues you know an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting it [noise] ... or what have you\nAnd it's it's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of uh stories today on the polling leading up to the mid term because it is all over the place\nAnd it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a\nFour team and a half percent chance of keeping the house this is almost identical to five thirty I it's\nTwo weeks before the presidential election in two thousand sixty in where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump pan what twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning\nWhich was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts and this company analyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports\nSo on which way they're going to go the cook Political Report today his shift in eight house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans were fourteen days to go before the midterm election the non partisan election forecast there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported\nThe non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts following the party's massive fund\nRaising hall in the third quarter of this year\nSo those are the two stories but then\nIf you turn to NBC News in the wall Street Journal bloom wave collapsing early voting shows geo pie out pacing Democrats in key states\nIn this story\nIs even as even prepared in a written as another sign that this so called blue way am eagerly anticipated blue wave could end up disappointing people next month if it arrives at all NBC News\nHas looked at early voting day and it provided by a company called target smart in eight states\nAnd found that GOP affiliated voters are out pacing democratic voters in seven of those including North Carolina\nGOP affiliated voters have surpassed Democrat voters in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada have\nDemocrat affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voters so far in the early voting the latest data distributed BC\nSuggest robust it as soon as the as them among my eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave Republicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage when in person early voting\nSo for example the entire early voting patriot in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\n\nNow that that's somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is there for Democrats are growing up in the early ...\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bat on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and again this is NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to conventional wisdom conventional wisdom is\nTick unlimited Katie's morning noon or night

White House same thing as eighty six percent chance today\nThe Democrats when the house almost identical eighty six percent chance Hillary wins the presidency two years ago today eighty six percent chance of Democrats when the house let me ask you a quick question here what if it is just the way it is discovered that the Democrats were behind this caravan\nEither organizing it or funding it encouraging it\nWould it be a crime\nTo have helped organize our fun this mass movement at ten thousand people the objective of which is no doubt to crash the U.S border\nWhat is more likely that Trump loaded with putting the influence the presidential election two thousand sixteen or Democrats loaded with organizers of the invasion to influence this election serious charge\nSerious serious

through it and began defeating Democrats the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousand tenet germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell where did you think about it ... you remember who started or remember who was\nAnd he had his phased in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God that

more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nRetail and there's two or three of these stories out there now this is just the latest about how you know political had one we told you about it yesterday don't get your hopes up it looks like the smaller reports not going to have it in fact it may never even be made public political said yesterday [noise]\nAll kinds of warnings now from the drive by media cautioning people to\nLower their expectations on the ... do you know there are Democrats there are educated Democrats who literally and believed all this time that Mueller has the smoking gun\nAnd that is just a matter of time that Mahler is going to reveal the proof and the evidence that Trump stole the election this is how do range they are\nThis is how distant and am since they are from commonsense unreality\nThere's something not right about these people folks they've gone off the deep end and collectively so this is not just a a few Democrats of fuel left us this is pretty much all of them believed to one extent or another that Mueller has the goods because of the goods are there to be found\nEven though the media haven't been able to find a report on they've got this hope invested so now tour three different stories warning Democrats the lower their expectations and this latest one here\nFrom the week it's a it's a really long piece how the mother fairy tale endings um the the author Matthew Walker hates Trump he's in bitter is bitter about having to admit that the investigation has gone aware\nThat's why you're calling it the Mahler fairy tale [noise]\nThey really believe despite the absence of any evidence despite what there is to know about how the FBI stacked the deck\nAnd planted spies and invented the steel ... that was Hillary despite all of this that's known they either don't know what because they haven't exposed himself to

mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant and Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media [noise] they've been lied\nTo for so long about things that the things they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid\nOf reality and truth that they're on the table do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta\nHaving the president whip people up at a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job\nIs covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man where has this guy been to the Trump\nWhipping people up at a rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a\nGym you can give you got all kinds of ... you can go be a waiver you obviously listen well\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here you know thousands and\nThousands of people who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudge and Ford say for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slammed moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm going to cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talked to him about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that's the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you can find Hillary's emails and media is looking for um nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand a Muslim the media they love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack Hillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the\nEmails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises guy for being able to body slam somebody they see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that\nThey think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nI think the Trump is recommending and praising ... ... ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up to this\nGuy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you do it I really didn't want us what you're ... you're not just fun and with your dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with\nYou so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you'll let somebody throw it back on them and it said guy give a disgrace that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC\nNot only do not understand real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who would like to them\nI think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that when we get back\n[noise] somebody has to

again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past I've kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise\nTo do this that and the other to get an office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly intimidated they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink\nNot worth your support they've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nThe gym a cost in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside and just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a week\nOr longer and he can't stand it\nAfter all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you keep falling for the lies and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem\nJeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some conventions setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president has it any more [laughter]\nBut what is troubling as to look behind you see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as far as to who believes [noise] and he does it I think because it still works until rile people up divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's probably knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spending golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the

Ohio David Europe first today high\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir\nThis morning I was listening to NPR and Steve [laughter] hey a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then\nI take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mommy here's one whenever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's not good when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster that there's you know thousands of the line well and they couldn't even see the end of the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so ah your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can do for\nWe've got a bad we got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I registered NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said\nUh for the audience and and then happened is why I get\nThe soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA ... but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this\nGroup of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and the violence in ...\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day assigning believe and they\nJust they just they just they just because they're human beings just to have a decent life you know in in in the end and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremists cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying we're talking about Trump being you know an assault base screwed Trump Trump simpler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated and designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood into the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this kind of thing [noise]\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like every other normal news event it just happened that we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video\nTape of what's this guy's Jorge ... Ramos or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what is a ... tell them no but what is it ... right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know\nOn the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at on their behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and he's bouncing for\nHe's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then there are different people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in the all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I ask myself how would the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching\nHim that these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nWish I could think of the actual name of the legislation but the impact of it is is that we have to show\nMore consideration to people who come from Central America than from Mexico in our asylum and an entry policy it was originally intended to dissuade people from Mexico\nFrom Washington and Lee attempting to\nImmigrate across the border but it's had the exact opposite effect it has forced people want to come into the United states to first go down to Guatemala El Salvador or Honduras and start the track from there because\nCurrent US law makes it easier to get into the country if you're a trek starts south of Michael\nAnd that's a lot of what's going on here\nBut if you in any way permit this mob to enter the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world and say come on it\nJust can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure border patrol\nUh American political systems and it's it's designed to make people I think put up their hands like summer started we can't stop at rush we can't stop but we just got a lot of men we can't stop it\nI I think it's ... it's almost a variation of a ... hour proven\nOr Kevin Easter sociologist who believe that the way to really transform America the way to really get this country right is to destroy it\nBy overwhelming the welfare state\nJust knitting as many people as possible demanding in claiming benefits to the point they cannot be paid there isn't the money I have the whole system collapse and then the left will be there to rebuild it\nIn their image\nBased on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left out and that is a strategic plan it's right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus\nAnd that's of I think another microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun\nIt illustrates America is by itself in wealth and prosperity and that we owe it to the rest of the world to share and it's not fair we have so much they have so little and\nThey live so relatively close\nDon't doubt the politics of this for eight minutes and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated with an assault on America for the purposes of trans forming it into the kind of country of the Obama heights\nWe're seeking and failed to accomplish thank goodness now [noise] New York\nTimes anatomy ... does not determine gender what what is this about what why in the world we're we're talking about a percentage of the population it's not even one percent here\nAnd yet has become a this group of people has become a major major support group of the American the left and the American media for what purpose\nDefining janitors says the New York times as a condition determines strictly by a person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists to band and long ago as oversimplified and often medically meaningless\n\nAre you kidding me determining whether somebody's male or female\nDetermined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable and needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by sensible scientists\nSo this is the party of science a Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and somewhere to climate change\nResearchers who studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed\nSaid that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge quote\nDr Josh it was safer and in droves endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea\nThat a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male ... necessarily\nAnd at the same thing when you have a baby that has female genitalia but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again as the doctor from\nMount Sinai in New York we know that there are a and there is a significant and durable biological underpinning to gender identity what we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand it in two thousand Eighteen it is hard wired is biological it is not entirely hormonal and we don't\nHave identified

business NBC News\nUS President Donald Trump said Monday the transgender issues were in flux in the ... to protect the country after a report that his administration was considering the defining janitor as male or female based on gender tail at birth and that drew wide spread condemnation\n\nTrump's that we have a lot of different concepts right now a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now asked about a campaign promise to protect the L G B. T. Q. humidity Trump said I'm protecting everybody\nI Want to protect our country under a proposal first reported by the New York times on Sunday the Trump Administration would narrow the definition of gender male or female at birth and it would be an changeable later in life\n[noise] okay\nYou're asking what's going on let me very simple eighth and yet very controversial you explain what's going on here\nThis is all politics pure and simple\nTotal politics disguised as something else than Democratic Party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd is in the process of trying to normalize them all by in training them as policy planks ... issues in the Democratic party platform and this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nBeing given the whole way of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority could end up being bullied into submission\nI have I have long believed that\nI just didn't have a I I did not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it\nBut I finally did and I really do believe that there are many psychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party as political issues that are then used as a as as\nThe joined the list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledged that government to deal with other government funded a that government protect and this of course then turns the Democratic party coalition into an even larger group of minorities\nBut it it conveys political issue status to things that\nSomeone's gender Jenna tail you're alone is not enough you see so now it's going to enter it has entered the scene as a bona fide political issue which has all the requirements and ask people who discriminate\nHas had people who are insensitive as people who are biased against them versus those over here\n[noise] it it it gets so\nGive you one what would they know they're not in society you want to bring them in the mind and we need assistance and so the lab gathers\nPeople and get together and assume the role of of championing causes which isn't a cause there is no blatant discrimination there is no blatant\n\nBigotry or any of this what happens is that people are minding their own business one day and confronted with the fact that a guy wants to use a girl's bathroom on the basis that he's not really a guy and we in society it's when you got to put up with it you got to tolerate it you can't discriminate you\nCan't be about what but but but but it doesn't make any sense of guys that guy was\nWhile he doesn't think he's the guy that's the yeah until it gets in there and this has been blown up now and what I mean is they take you get enough I'm telling you get enough\nUnstable groups of people\nAnd properly motivate them and convince them that you're gonna get the government to fix this and get even with the people who are mistreating I mean you can create if you if you think of it this way as a group enough large enough to join the rest of your coalition that go out and help you win
