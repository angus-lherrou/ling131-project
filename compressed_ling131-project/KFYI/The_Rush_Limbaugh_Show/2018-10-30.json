[laughter]\nAnd it was only ever miles and miles reverberated up the iceberg taped the last top dark yeah you know how do you sell that Antarctica is going to get one for months have the you got to go have to go after you know this guy kept telling him the ending of the books that he was reading and you get aggravated stabbed [laughter]\nSo they had to be a welder name boiler alert and those are actually how this book in full house in ... Ohio has apologized for hosting a blank\nEvents over the weekend [noise] event that involved ... [noise] even gave us a better Nate weeds you born in ...\n... now they call the swastikas Saturday oh you do have the same dad like they were killed in Pittsburgh we were just talking about this before the show who was the how the horrible ... who is Shaun White's the snowboarder Shaun White the snowboarder Olympian ... went out for Halloween as uh\nIt's special Olympians do put it all over social media oh boy dum dum\nAnd you know the people are gonna be there but you can get away with Andrew said if you were in a party of eight people yeah but even then risky yeah but just um and we all know switch swastikas Sundays\nYeah he's come on haunted house get it right prince says the state's is looking to claim ownership over the use of black color purple I was going to say the color\nOf the color purple then filmed them live and recorded music they want to make sure that no other artist tries to become prince wear purple coat suit keep her like you can't do that actually a two thousand twelve there was a court case but allowed to shoemaker little tone to trademark red and sold on the shoes\nSo you can't just say you can't wear purple when performing music because you're copying principles that's ridiculous we will see but if you're a purple twelve could never sing purple bells again called on brand true although the main guy and people are dead so he can do and we can't [laughter] but he is a nice shade of for\nWe have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across\nSouthern may go with their intention to get to the United states and the drive by made it says is just being ... upset Trump's base that the implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity\nAnd Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you're go vote it's again a classic expression or illustration\nOf how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remains\nSupportive of Donald Trump but that will get to get more details on I ... back to my little test so I ran out of these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are committee chairmen not\nAll but many of them are committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so we want to try to parlay their years in the house into private sector\nSuccess I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power reelection\nAnd power certainly old back me up on those these are students viewed the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are known as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party that holds the white\nHouse in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they caved in\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left and the drive by as are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest among races are in in other parts of Senate of course now they're saying now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter or the American people are fed up and\nThey are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit home they're not going to twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixth day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called American dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work\nBy his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\nMy forecast for the twenty Eighteen congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights as\nYou remember from my book great news for him [laughter]\nWith Robert my great book great in the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era\nThat I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift in uh in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained\nUh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\nAnd it's all\nBeing ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading pill movement\nAnd the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red\nPeel a movement but\nSays he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate\nOr the dry buys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is\nGoing great with Republican administrations\nUh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats and the media think it is\nA problem\nThere's talk all over ... that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these falls surprises he\nCalls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was though I mean that was totally trumped up made up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump\nOr we have the October surprises the usual the caravan of crisis mail bomb so some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these false surprises and other events\nWhile intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans from holding the house\nAll of the above surprises in advance have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating a building and blue wave with a red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded\nBlue wave you by the way this is your what a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue wave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they'd take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and it's not that's not a blue wave\nA blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they're gonna they're gonna win the Senate if they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of\nMedia lingo they'll call it whatever they want if they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue way were designed to create this massive voter intensity and it turned out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than Democrats turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up as well in early voting it's hard to explain it away but big inclusion is it there has been no blue way there is not even been a blue ripple that you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blow bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support log signed blue congressional districts and major coastal\nCities [noise] [noise] so this guy is of the\nIn their place and this this orders\nWell in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary nomination was replaced knees never Trump hers were retiring are Trump supporters\nThere Trump and so the the total number forty five resigning is not ... enough itself a completely negative\nCharacteristic the power of incumbency still can't be denied it's an amazing thing I think it's still true house races in Ninety eight percent of them the incumbent wins\nEvery year year and year out regardless there might be a year or two where there's a larger wider variants than that but that's the overall stat\nBuddy it could well be that\nThe never Trump or is that retired knew they had no prayer anyway in their districts and so they quote unquote took the high road and uh the\nSlum Trump chunks of phone I don't I don't want to be partners potentially split the scene and they're\nReplaced by a ... and Trump supporters so that could end up being a net positive okay when we come back the drive by media all over now blaming me we're back first it was the Oklahoma City\nBombing and now me and others in conservative media being blamed for all of the rest of this today [noise]\nFuneral services for a synagogue

ratcheted up from there and it's all an attempt to suppress political speech the left doesn't want to hear [noise]\n[noise] and now even though the gunman at the synagogue on Saturday in Pittsburgh

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay a little bit more background on the fourteenth amendment here [noise]\nBecause it's going to be relevant as the issue goes forward [noise] again it was added after\nThe civil war its purpose was to overrule the Dred Scott decision\nWhich was a horrible Dred Scott sanctions slavery Roger\nThan it was the chief justice for ever immortalized in infamy\nIt held at black slaves were not citizens so Congress got into gear and pass the fourteenth amendment guaranteed that freed slaves would have all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and the state where in they reside which means the draft or is that the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact the very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents are so important quote this meeting the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person who was born\nIn the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nIt was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nThere was an Eighteen eighty four case elk versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not even couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans\nBecause they were subject to tribal jurisdiction not us jurisdiction will an illegal alien here is not subject to us jurisdiction there under the jurisdiction of where they came from if they're here illegally gas when this\nAll changed in the Nineteen sixties concomitant with Senator Kennedy\nWanting to re oh we had shut down all immigration from Twenty one sixty five along comes Senator Kennedy in a pre Chappaquiddick days wanting to reopen it for the express purpose of making sure the Democratic party always had a permanent underclass\nOf voters dependent on them and the governor [noise] you're listening\nTo Rush Limbaugh fan boys on the rise bumbling by the MIT\nFor you time five fifty KFYI\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy or larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old and a hundred thousand dollar or larger life policy did you know you can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy and the cold hard cash I Know the economy's been a struggle for many people need cash they need it right away\nAnd you can get cash right away for your life ... if you're over Seventy five you have a one hundred thousand dollar or larger life almost you know I Want you to write this number down give these folks\nAnd it's the same as saying that they did on Trump's travel ban and so forth\nBut still despite all that I didn't get smart to make it an issue the Web can sit up there in the ring its hands over oh my God Trump is just trying to round up his base it's cold winning an election\nWhere we've gotten to a dangerous point here where we left refuses to accept election outcomes and folks that\nCannot we the anything good that has always been the glue that's held us together\nI I ... I I have at times I've marvel that this country has held together the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven them the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper in the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document as what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country and we may not unify issue to issue the issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising am haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things\nThat have nothing in common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that um I'm In junior high intramural football in softball that nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised ...\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment\nIt derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been teaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're\nPerfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case was losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses and we have a political party that's behind all of this\nAnd right now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened\nIf not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out I think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence\nAnd so forth when it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good and when they feel band and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques that essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThen we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays per article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated\nStarting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate that's what immigration was people were coming here to become\nAmericans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in ah in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there's no interest in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nThey use this term tribal but we're ... our population because modern arrivals don't all sneak to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate gone surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company that are we going to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being said if that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that the Senate ah\nLook we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThose would be fine and dandy but the caravan I don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones and it was all about door or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships of one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate\nProblem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's and [noise] we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies going to relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\nBecause they have these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a sure political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know a wise or George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a\nLike a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states the purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump into advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network high\n[noise] Ah yes fresh uh two years ago my husband and I adopted for Hispanics sisters\nWho were in foster care and we had had him a couple of years and then they cannot flick option their parents

back home and and you know now they love Trump and they think this has got to stop and have an escape because my father's been president twenty eight years with his\nMother fled to Mexico not because of a sudden these people come here and cut off all crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just said [laughter]\nAnd they can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way you know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and teen they let her across they sent the other six teams with our back\nUnless that one so they can't say we don't have hot they do the situation I Know I Need help but you know even Hispanic girls that\nTrump was horrible that he was sent all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them or whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's a once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just\nIt's impossible support on little less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we owe and so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't\nAnyway appreciate the jam thanks much will take a break and be back\nRussia I don't\nFind

Mike shields and Washington Post columnist Max Boot about the links between\nTrump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue sugar\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violence has a very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack\nWe always ask what radicalized than what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as the terrorists and you cannot divorce the actions of the second ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's Max Boot Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of these ... people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing so\nWhat he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mum preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this\nThe moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs that are being nobody on our side doing this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable to dispatch Trump and it's always\nA one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you don't want is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that\nNot a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms\nOf this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight\nWas that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots\nAnd I ... valley and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in\nThe presumption ups superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his motors is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat what all of us had been saying to each other\nBut you you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh dad or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected when you think and\nWhat you say what you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto would not because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid\nAnd you're so mindless that's been golly you can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd that we've even got never Trump conservatives are out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that ...\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it in the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied\nYour is the reason that this is all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now you're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity\nI just wanted to make a quick point that's a hard left and the media and the especially Hollywood and I think it has been engaging in gas lighting or the right\nWould you would ... would you define that I hear so many people use that word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending it to be defined\nOkay gas lighting and the most common example is when I'm In a family they cripple usually been nice this trial in the family to take care of all of the kicking and burned\nAnd what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about them they snare at them and especially when people aren't looking\nAnd then if that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make up the entire narrative and what they believe rushed it that that person is an idiot they're not evil\nNow I'm not seeing it all that every I'm liberal person is like this I think that they're these kinds of people exist on both sides but I think that elect elevate people like this and I think the right height that shut them up\nUm and that's really all you can do I mean you can't always control who's on your side\nBut you can control the you elevate and I'm lying is perfectly fine if your gas sliding um and especially the a dog whistle\nBecause you just imagine what the person says oh what will clearly that was written it's well they use the word the oh well don't you know what the the dog would do with someone on the right uses that they use the word the that that kind of logic what\nWhite

I lost her when she was how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light\nA I got [noise]\nAnd ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything they get to define that get to decide everything what they say is\nIs what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what have you and that that that has been my point it's just a different way of saying\nThat\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated it was\nIn response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these\nGay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business and the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots would refuse to bake a cake or take\nPhotos on gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when ... when when Indiana passes along Pence is the governor the media was out ranged and they began to report\nOn this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude know thing that they do wear what they report in the way they report it and what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for why they were and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't know it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this one the one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo me that typical Indiana bed yet\nAnd she was just answering their questions naive way and in his leash she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media dead the to the state of Indiana\nIs gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accept it and it's this arrogance and this is the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you\nHave a the synagogue shooting well the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative medium posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody\nThinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't and what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition split numbers normal\nAre trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you if isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut\nThe electoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what's [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
