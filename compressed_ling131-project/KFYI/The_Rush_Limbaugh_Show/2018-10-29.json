TV station in South Carolina\nAny kind of uprising any kind of ... the first instinct as a drive by media\nHas\nAnd not what I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe phone call conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten\nWasn't inflammatory to say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats and left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they liked her doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not\nCalled out not reported and then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not how\nMany years have an average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed it's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words\nYou have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable 'cause they hate the president will do anything they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this\nThis anger and\nIf it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from the weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans on Trump because\nWe don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico [noise]\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise] and you know what if I have\nGotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is my young men to pay attention to it it is my man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people you think are fed up with this by now you would think this is going to affect\nThe midterm elections Democrats and maybe I got I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going for trying to ratchet these two things up\nTo try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump you may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house no you\nHave to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up and just somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but that doesn't ...\nDo not know it from a exact hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans once this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up of being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed they're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tuned it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported you had this supports do you have the support black lives matter they weren't condemned and one day consequences for that protesters good role in the Ferguson, Missouri and it literally tear up a town on on why they create a lie about\nThe shooter in that in that in ... the Mike Brown good water first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store in ... or whatever they just totally make it up turn it inside\nOut all for the express purpose of blaming\nDonald Trump now it it it it gets it gets to the point that\nIf the media wonders why they're in such ill this repealed right now it's because of this\nNobody believes what'd you say\nNobody trusts what you're saying it's so obviously politically charged it's so obvious that you're you're passionate about this\nIs what you can do with it politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not squirrel hill but I Know where it is\nThe guy that shot this place up Hey David Donald Trump\nDonald Trump was too big a Jewish supporter his daughter converted to Judaism before marrying questionnaire he more into the American embassy to Jerusalem this guy thinks Trump is part of the sellout\nTo worldwide Jewish people and yet the media is blaming\nCompany saying well a lot of that that Iraq and all that just that that that's just a disguise you know that that they that they just did that the\nCover up Trump's real anti Semitism Donald Trump's maybe one of the best friend was Israel and Israeli Jews have had in the in the oval office and I don't know how long remember the case of\nWas that it's it's just a David Koch David Koch of the Koch brothers\nThey're re Wichita energy from and family\nAnd David Koch and his wife Julia donated funny the five million dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other organizations at the hospital told the hospital's locked away except the donation\nBecause David Koch is nothing more than a yellow ballet and white print believes racist and the only reason for his donation wants to cover his racism and hide it so people didn't really see\n\nThis is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as ill motivated\nWhy does somebody think that way what would make those nurses thinks that way I submit to you that it is the drive by media I submit to you that it is very union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they had in school\nWere not even a legitimate acts of charity or compassion are allowed because they're not real their relief from racist in big it's who are trying\nTo mask and cover up their racism and bigotry and so the money should not be accepted and if it were accepted it should be returned Americans\nRepublicans conservatives have been blamed for the deaths of the millions of Americans in I don't know how many ways starting with opposition to Obamacare probably starting before about\nAmericans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions around the world because we won't sign on to the concept of man made climate change\nDonald Trump was elected to be different Donald Trump was elected because people were fed up\nWith politics as usual I must tell you this people fed up with politics see the Democrats\nIn the media politicizing everything it's not going to send people running the Democratic party quite the opposite of what the media thanks to the media and the Democrats obviously think that the majority of the American people want to see the country the way the Democrats do throughout the lens of everything being political\nAnd people don't want to see it that way the Democrats in the media telling Trump to tone it down\nBut they tone nothing down themselves what was the mayor of Baltimore said the protesters we need to give them space to destroy we need to stand back and let them get it under their system\nThey say nothing with the Republicans were gunned down they abuse power to hide the Hillary's crimes to fix elections\nTo runs ... coups against the duly elected president elect wants Trump to tone down his efforts at self defense that's what Trump is doing he's assault and he said countless times if I'm here I'm going to hit back\nWhen Trump is blamed for the actions of a lunatic he's told to be more dignified remain silent be like Mitt Romney would be a be reserved and so forth\nBoth to sit back with Occupy Wall street black lives matter and the purple

and just take it he's just she those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump is it wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you just sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the

angry\nWhile he was mayor and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him so\nTrump ... not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to what they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year\nAnd a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up first today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rush pleasure to speak with you thank you sir hey\nI can tell you that last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to armed with school police and it was voted down eight to one\nAbout this thing happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop it\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you are but uh there's no amount of death\nThere's no amount of shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about\nSomething much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that you can't but other than that you got oh freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in eastern ... but but but but but but what what all for freedom as we define that\nHe mentioned this let's go to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself as soon as this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business\nWell it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the court and joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's for air force one is part that's where Trump takes the helicopter to get on board air force one way is going to travel a reporter said Mr President do you think you need to revisit go see\nSome guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\n[noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is\nTrump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nPolice caught up with him the worst\nPart is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until retailer started\nCalling them silent crime it's why

their little team got Obama was up to his eyeballs in hard core anti Semite like Al Sharpton and out of the White House over a hundred times talking is oh Don extent in that hard core anti Semitic church Jeremiah Wright's church\nAnd they photographed them Obama yeah with that world class Jew hater\nAlthough it's our time where we have\nOne day said Julia when you ask them that\nYou know [laughter] I don't what what do you think they're going to say rush what do you what do you think they're going to say that they didn't say damn well that's\nRight and they're never going to they're never going to they're not getting Obama wasn't there guy Obama was who they think they are\nRight in ... well spoken highly educated reasonable ACA damning intellectual um and in look in the leftist world the only African Americans\nWho can do anything wrong are conservative African Americans they're not going to get on Obama are hanging around ... minds like Farrakhan agenda Robert Jackson Al Sharpton are busy promoting all those people\n\nThey feel sorry for 'em up you get right down to brass tacks may feel sorry for them they think that because of the ancient history of America with slavery discrimination and all that 'cause it's just that that really we we we can't hold them accountable way they have excuses you know we can look the other way not exaggerating\nOn that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was a kind of standing right next to him all of the Aretha Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him\nAnd many\nDrive by news organizations cropped Farrah Khan out of the photo\nWhen they sent it down their news wires so they know but\nIt's this is the point we have a two tiered justice system and we clearly\nHave a two tiered political system we have criminalized\nRight wing or conservative Republican politics and policy and at the same time exempted the\nAh from any criticism or criminality um\nMost of the policies of the politics of the left but I understand your anger it's late and democracy and they're never held accountable to

well they've created a new service called remote piece the remote PC wet you securely connect to your PC or Mac for anywhere now why is remote PC important to you\nI you know last time I went to Atlanta guard with an EMT poor service and in New Orleans and I and the rabbi held that Al Gore's inconvenient truth and and started Ted preach on that and I and I just\nI couldn't take it anymore you know it it's not even my religion and\nNo way that limited by what was that rabbi conditioning what was he was he suggesting that the congregation as Jews\nHave the the signed onto the Al Gore climate change premise that that was part of not not the Jewish faith but then if you did well describe George ... maybe you wouldn't be welcome\nI don't think he way that he he when he was a fostering an atmosphere where he wouldn't be welcomed but I I think you know\nIt's just the pilot us as they should have everything right\nAbsolutely that wouldn't have happened in the entire time I grew up I mean part time I go to Ken and maybe it's because I I mainly grew up in military and I got my dad was in the air force but there was never politics never came current event said but not politics\nLet me ask you this is like me ask you this ... I'm a ... in your opinion based and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe parent's opinion can liberal Druze\nBe anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't I said that they were I mean because what I\nSay that yeah because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that\nThey don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think it's a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThoroughly but willing to claim the victim had nothing else [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli\nSentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's it's anti that\nReligion is not anti Iran they still need the race in order to have racial politics but it's if I had the religion\nIn time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from my religion I don't think you can and it you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out no way that I did this flame or I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that it yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian Tito um I don't see\nThem as necessarily being as soon as Islam but\nI you know but I think if the if the if if I got\nThis ... that's exactly right I was just wondering is this all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are the trend is towards atheism and no God\nOr at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of ... than one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so how this of this event in Pittsburgh\nGiven everything else that you say that you are there's all the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it\nSo this event in Pittsburgh did it did it and to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there are targeting a Jews in a way that they would want to go she'd have to think about I think that that\nThese are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much a\nRe July presents racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms\n[noise] a lot of people do a lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you would think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord to do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk\nAnd his pipe bombs ... what do you think\nThe odds are that the Dr ... and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm\nRemember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an\nEntirely different for why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that in ...\nAnd once I met her to be calm but I don't think that the American\nViewers are looking at in terms of my head against my father was a murder you know here's what I said ... yeah he is responsible\nFor fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls him out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... living and there was a murder we didn't say there's no we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to do murder\n[laughter]\nNo they are so they they when when they're when they're confronted with what they're actually saying then they pull back and deny it\nBecause

violence right now something they cannot be established something they cannot be proven but yet there it is reported as fact\nGleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] you know\nI don't know what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the\nInternational political expert\nAt what have you and I used to think of the guy that was a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces in advance\nThinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has gone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of what what will people asking what what what happened to Max Boot [noise] [noise]\nAnd now he's on CNN as often as easy as he can get on there just ripping Trump a new one who primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior and his ah come\nPortman just isn't presidential you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber for rumor and conspiracy theory\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other than and Wilbur ultra left his heart was says mix\nIs one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O P White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack\n[noise]\nI maintain to you as I said in my opening monologue the program today\nThat we get up every day and we see people\nAnd institutions that we admire and respect under attack I mean every day the left is politicizing everything including mass murder\nWherever it happens they are politicizing the whether\nRepublicans have been called murderers\nBy the Democratic party and willing accomplices in the media Mr boat simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government the purposes of controlling the way people live\n[noise] [noise] ah\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism successfully or why\nThe mainstream maybe is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media\nReporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual it certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and an you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first hour of the Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected\nPrecisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understandable one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and they just don't talk about them that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about him that way but Trump did\nAnd so they all start laughing they miss guy can't be serious he is not gonna last this campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump waiting\nAnd exercise is not going to last this craziness\nTrump kept slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable a land back uh you know walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want\nTrump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth and they thought this is to sift\nIt can't happen at Camp David Nugent you'd never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive but\nTrump survived and then they started the two years silent cool and that is\nThe real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that I\nOr anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and he is doing\nIn corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government for the express purpose of overturning an election I don't care how much power you'd think I've got I couldn't come\nClose to doing what was done and has been done in the past two years\nIncluding the Mueller investigation including the planning of out right lies five times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof the Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election for two years Mr boat\nFor two years with no evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been any collusion\nThey were hoping they were hoping\nAnd they live with every day with the ideas are going to wake up and that the smoking gun was going to fall into their lab but they knew\n\nThat there was any collusion they knew they were trying to create some they knew what was going on the FBI\nThe D. O. J. they know the tricks being played and they willingly supported those tricks they ignored the real collusion and reading of elections on the part of a Hillary Clinton campaign of DNC I don't care what kind of power use think\nWe've got over here and conservative media\nWe couldn't get anywhere I mean we couldn't we couldn't come close\nTo getting away with running any kind of a soft or a silent\nCoup using the upper reaches of power at the department of justice all Obama loyalists and Hillary loyalists\nWe no way we wouldn't have the power to plant spies in the campaign of a presidential campaign we opposed there is no way any of us\nCould rise up a phony document purported to be real intelligence claiming that Hillary didn't despicable things on a bad in Moscow and go get a fire warrant to spy on the Hillary can't there's no way any of us in the in the conservative media could come\nClose to doing anything that has become a natural everyday occurrence on the ... you want to talk about extremism and this this so called magic goal of ... to brainwash what\nHappened in the past two years in the mainstream media brainwashing the American people do you do now\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I Wanna I Wanna I Want to ask a question here when Robert Mueller does not come up with the goods when when it is finally admitted\nOr allege that Donald Trump did not ... ... with the Russians and he didn't cheat steal the election how many crazies on the left are going to go bonkers when they hear this meaning how many people in this country to this day at this moment still believe\nThe Trump stole the election he worked with putting on the Russians to do it and it's only a matter of time and why do they think this because the media has assured them that it happened for two years\nWith the constant reporting of anonymous sources weeks here leaks there James combing manufacturing weeks to get a special counsel appointed\nJames Comey refusing to go public and tell them about the Trump was it a target when Trump was\nRoberts ours has his first court appearance us attorney Scott Brady lays out the charges he faces\nOn Saturday October twenty seven twenty eight seen my office ...
