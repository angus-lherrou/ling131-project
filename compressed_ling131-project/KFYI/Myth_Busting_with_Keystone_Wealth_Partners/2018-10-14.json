on your entire life savings I think it is getting a numbers one eight hundred seven six seven\nFifteen fifty nine and before I dive in today's topic let's talk about this week's helped it because you need your help to enjoy your wealth and today I have an article that was recently written in fitness magazine the talks about the number one reason\nYou should talk to yourself at the gym straight talk to yourself and when the going gets tough the tough get going to themselves use your words to power through your next workout Jeff Olson recently wrote here and fitness\nAnd a recent study published in medicine and science of sports and exercise found that athletes who practiced motivational self talk that his thinking positive encouraging words were able to push harder for longer which ultimately increase their endurance\nThis strategy reduces perceived effort making the task seem less difficult says this PHD Anthony Blanche field and the beauty of it is it it's easy in free and you can do it anywhere\nAnd so the next time you see I mean let's face it we all see that person at the gym carrying the giant gallon jug\nAround right that is filled with some pink liquid filled up with some pre workout they had the ... you know the waistband around and they're yelling at themselves you know they're getting all fired up and smack in themselves in the head and they got their spotters standing over the top of them screaming you got this you got this I'm not\nI'm not necessarily saying that and I don't think fitness magazine as saying that but\nHaving some motivational positive self talk in our lives is very very helpful when it comes to working out and why does any of that matter\nBecause like I talk about each and every week I mean you can do a great job with your money if you're not healthy enough to enjoy any of it or you're not around do enjoy it because you weren't healthy enough what good is it we're very interconnected and that's why he's done we've created a comprehensive\nAll encompassing set up where we handle not just your financial planning but also the asset management also your taxes and your tax planning an estate planning any or legal work we\nCan do all of that for you if you need it because these things are far too integrated including our help but back to the topic at hand because this isn't a health show was a show about or wealth and our money are you preparing for a new face in life maybe a new career or you're single and you're on your own now we're planning for retirement that's\nA big transition you within five ten years away from retirement or did you just retire may be time to upgrade your financial advisor but how do you know it's actually time as I mentioned earlier is there a check engine light the pops on like in your vehicle when you know you need it well interestingly there are and I'm going to give you today on MythBusters accused of all foreigners before\nIndicators that you need a different adviser and so the first indicator that may be time to upgrade your financial advisor is if they are not a fiduciary\nNow what am I talking about we've heard this word nobody was very familiar with it then the department of labor came out with this bill that wanted to require all advisors who are helping clients on I raise in four one K. is any sort of retirement account that they would have to be ... years\nAnd it became very important and advisors who really weren't legitimate through Sherry started saying wow this is important my clients are asking me but here's the best way to find out whether an advisor has your best interests at heart is to simply ask\nAre you a ... year this is the single most important question you can ask because if you don't get a straight yes or no answer that's a sure sign something is it right\nYeah I feel strongly that investors should work\nOnly with ... ... all the time not selling products on behalf of their broker dealer some of the time and by the way I should have already said this what is the producer\nIf ... is simply someone who is legally bound to put your best interests ahead of their own and if you're wondering to yourself well yeah and that seems pretty obvious for someone who's going to if I'm going to go get advice on my entire life savings\nAnd ask someone what I should do with everything I've saved isn't it sort of assumed that they're going to have to put my best interest out of their own you would think so but the majority of financial advisors still in operation right now are not required to do that\nIn the same way and attorney or a CPA would be and so you should absolutely demand this because if they're not held to a fiduciary standard of care\nLike most advisors are it means they just have to sell you products that are reasonable that are crazy\nAnd the easiest way because many advisors now know that this is important so they will say yes I Am a fiduciary and clients come in and they say you know John I Need a second opinion at like a second look at what we're doing here my advisor told me they were fiduciary but then they told me this variable annuity and they did this other stuff in it I don't think it was it the fiduciary and so basically they occasionally\nOpen accounts that are charging fees\nAnd are able to say yeah must do share because they do sometimes\nAct in that manner but the problem is they wear two hats which is more dangerous to be honest than somebody who just says I'm not a ... and so the easiest thing to do is go to a registered investment advisor R. I. A. gate we a Keystone weren't All right we don't have a broker dealer\nWe don't take commissions we dropped our licenses all of us or a foreign brokers from banks and brokered the older we dropped our licenses that we hung a broker dealers it allowed us to take commissions on security sales\nSo the easiest thing I mean look at your current advisors business card does the bottom of it say registered representative of X Y Z securities because if it does that right there tells you that they do not always act as a fiduciary and using it in under ... Sherry standard of care\nIt means they're registered representative of X Y Z security then they sell products on behalf of that company that they worked for under a suit abilities standard of care\nSo think about it I mean if you're not going to do this on your own and you want to get advice don't you want to make darn sure that where you get advice from\nSomebody who has your best interest in mind\nWho is legally held to a standard of care that requires them to put your best interests ahead of there's I mean that should be a given and I know you may like your current adviser and they may take you golfing and they go to your church or whatever it may be but if they are not one hundred percent of the time ... operating under your best interest legally\nThe whole entire foundation of the relationship is broken and we wonder why do you have to be five hundred made over ten percent a year for the last Thirty years and the average investor recorded doll bar has barely outpaced inflation I mean the average Americans barely outpaced three and a half percent a year well the simplest lowest cost anyone could have done it strategy earned over ten\nWhy would you start wondering well where are we getting advice from 'cause good advice I mean that shouldn't happen where we getting good advice or we didn't get any advice from someone who is required to put our interests ahead of their own\nThe data shows us that the majority of us are not that's a huge problem so the first sign that it may be time to upgrade your financial advisor is if they are not a fiduciary a hundred percent of the time are they a registered investment advisor ask them for for a D. V.\nAnd if they can't produce it just don't even walk just run the other direction\nAnd if you're not sure where to turn you know that your person is not a fiduciary hundred percent of the time you're kind of thinking they're probably not and you just want a second opinion we've done that for hundreds of people just like you you're accused of well partners we are a group of reformed brokers\nBetween us and Keystone Law firm we have almost thirty people on our team offices in Chandler as well Scottsdale\nAnd our objective throughout retirement map review is to give you an honest second opinion\nOf exactly where you stand with your money if you say two hundred fifty thousand or more for retirement it costs nothing that comes with no obligation you can get that by calling one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine again the number one eight hundred seven six seven\nOne five five nine or you can go to Keystone well partners dot com selected you like to retire map review and I'm going to take a quick\nSixty second step away but when I come back we'll continue to discuss the last three signs that may be time to upgrade your advice [noise]\nAre you remember that first day when you met you shared some stories ask some questions and got that comfortable feeling so a second date was set and then a third that's how the best relationships are formed they start with a comfortable feeling pretty soon you build trust that's so important you have that kind of relationship with your financial advisors if you don't I recommend having us\nFirst date with John ... and the team is he still will partners on your first date you'll share some coffee in conversation and they're often they want to learn about you and your family and they want you to get to know them\nA lot of financial professionals are only interested in your money John and the team it keeps them will partners are more interested in building trust but that takes time\nSo please call them today and for eight zero seven oh two thirty thirty and set up that first day comfortable relaxed conversational that's the best way to get started call for eight zero seven oh two thirty thirty Keystone partners\nIs a registered investment advisory for Keystone well partners and keeps them off of them are separate entity and must be engaged independently\nAnd hang hang hang [noise]\n\nWelcome back to the program thank you for joining me a myth busting with Keystone while partners this is the show that talks all about your money the world of investing and most importantly how do you make sense of all the information that's out there how do you separate myth from truth to do the best job possible with what you've worked let's face it your lifetime\nTo accumulate and on today's show I'm sharing the four indicators\nThat you need a different adviser\nAnd I don't want anything lost in translation or I'm not suggesting the Keystone oil partners is the only quality good from\nA lot of financial professionals are only interested in your money John and the team it keeps them well partners are more interested in building trust but that takes time\nSo please call them today and for a zero seven oh two thirty thirty and set up that first day comfortable relaxed conversational that's the best way to get started calling for eight zero seven oh two thirty thirty\nKeystone well partners is registered invested advisory for Keystone well foreigners and keep some law for our separate entity and must be engaged independently\nThis report is brought you buy indeed dot com\nSunday partly sunny skies a slight chance of showers in the valley high Seventy eight\nTop ranked independent investment advisor for the masters degree in financial services [noise]\nCertification from Stanford University he's a published author and regular contributor to local and national media publication\nHere's Mitt busting with\nKeystone wealth partners\nWho good morning and welcome back to the program thank you for joining the mist busting with Keystone well partners I'm your host each and every weekend my name is John ... I'm the founder and managing director of Easter well partners we are an independent registered investment advisory firm with officers in Chandler as well as Scottsdale\nBetween us and Keystone Law from our sister company we have about thirty folks working for retirees and pre retirees all around the valley\nHelping you retire in stay retired that's really our passion here Keystone oil partners in the show is dedicated to helping provide you clarity in a world where it's more difficult now than ever because the amount of information we're consuming to actually separate myth from truth\nTo do a great job with what we've worked our lifetime to say and so if you're someone who's a truth seeker who's fed up with outdated advice again my name is John ... and I'm a reformed broker and it's really my goal to reaffirm what you know to be true and challenged the advice simultaneously that you had been told is true and in fact is not\nAnd of course I'm biased but I think you're likely tuning into the most important radio show when it comes to your retirement and your financial life\nAnd that's why here on today's show I'm Talking about\nHow to know when it's time to change advise\nYou as a father a five and it's a husband one of the things I started becoming much more interested in and looking at was what were the safety features of vehicles as my family grew and I realize you know one of the things that was most important to me is I like that when you reverse out\nMy wife's car now she's reversing it doesn't just notify you were signaled obviously as a reverse camera but it'll actually stop the vehicle was something gets in the way like it won't let you drive in a couple of times backing out of our driveway if you get close on either side any other objects it'll actually stop you\nAnd so some of you may have this on your vehicles but\nIt scares me because it feels a jerk see what it stops you so quickly that it feels like you hit someone you know when you're backing out of your driveway or out of your garage and you hit somebody the parked behind you knew didn't know they were there we probably all done it at some point in our lives and that feeling of just oh right when it happens you know you hit something and you're going oh no what is back there\nWell my wife's car it's sort of feels like that 'cause it stops you so abruptly and and I always think that I hit somebody that was behind me I look back oh no that's just the safety feature\nBut it has the lane assist whereas you drift off it boom and actually we goes your we'll back kind of into the lane the steering wheel it's it's pretty neat\nAnd if you're wondering here like why is John even talking about his wife's car what is that up to do with money I Apologize I didn't ramble a little bit there but I promise I'm getting to a point here and the point is just as your family grows and you need to upgrade your car to maybe more safer or more reliable model you need to upgrade your general practitioner to a specialist\nTo and sometimes you upgrade your financial advisor to find one who aligns with your specific circumstances and needs\nThere are a lot of financial advisors others think about it do you go to a physician for a general ailment or something's going on\nAnd then what happens once they figure out what the problem is or generally think they may have an idea where do you go from there\nYou go see a specialist for your family doctor says yeah we think it's this you need to go over here to this person who was an expert in that\nSee we do this we seek out experts and increasingly here in America we have the benefit of actually utilizing experts in specific nice areas in our lives for different parts of our lives\nBut many of you were working with financial advisors were basically glorified financial sales people working for broker dealers\nWho may be of help you accumulate some wealth or open a step IRA or whatever it may be maybe they are sitting in your bank branch and that's great but are they experts in retirement like if you're getting near retirement or maybe you just had a business sale\nHave they handle a lot of those before maybe you're five years or ten years away from retirement or you're just getting ready to retire maybe you're trying to figure out should I take Social Security should I stagger the two benefits between my spouse and I\nShould I wait\nCan I follow restricted application like what are my options here do I have too much risk not enough risk and that's why on today's show I'd been sharing\nSport indicators that you need a different financial advisor we're discussing this today because the Keystone oil partners it's really our mission as a group of reform brokers helped clients prepare for their future and avoid shortfalls and retirement\nAnd the goal of financial confidence is to have more freedom it's about extracting more joy out of life more time with your family more freedom to travel and more ways to create those special memories\nAnd the best way I Know to make that all possible is to raise your standards of what you should expect out of the relationship with your financial advisor a high level advisor can custom build a plan designed to provide you with predictability confidence in financial independence and the first indicator that I alluded to earlier on the show\nIs if they are not a fiduciary one hundred percent of the time are they and registered investment advisory firm\nDo they have your best interests at mind and are they legally held to that standard of care that's one of the main reasons I started Keystone XL partners and left my broker dealer\nI was sick of being a glorified financial salesperson I wanted to be a legitimate financial advisor working in the best interests of my clients and that was like east almost started and that's why all of our advisors here or a for brokers from banks and broker dealers and insurance companies\nBecause we knew there was a better way to do it so the first thing the first indicators if they are not a produce one hundred percent of the time for a\nSecond indicator is how do they help you with taxes how do they help you with taxes are good for you\nSo the visor should do more than just recommend investments one important service that we provide you're used to all partners is optimizing your portfolio for tax purposes so think to yourself how does your advisor decide whether to allocate certain investments to your taxable account versus non taxable account\nSuch as an individual retirement account also what about selecting mutual funds\nOr the utilizing index funds like we do or low cost you ... are they using actively traded mutual funds that tend to have high internal turnover which means a lot of the portfolio is moving which can create capital gains and a lot of tax inefficiency or they tax last harvesting for you and your accounts and here's the best question\nAsked question because think about this this is so relevant right now we just had the largest tax reform since Reagan\nIt just happened to a really good question to ask yourself as as your advisor actually sat down and don't tax planning with you and they sat down and gone over how the tax reform impacts your money how you need to be adjusting your plan because if you're paying them money\nIf you're paying them to be your financial advisor don't you think your taxes and your tax planning\nIs pretty important and very impactful component to your plan of course it is when it keeps the partners we do the tax planning for you\nOne of the things that I was working on my master's degree certified tax specialist we provide specific tax planning for clients we don't shy away from it we understand that that's one of the most important things are your advisors tax laws harvesting inside of your accounts are they looking for opportunities to match up Capitol losses with capital gains are they doing that for you\nOr your Ross converting are you taking distributions pre Seventy and a half if there's opportunities in lower tax brackets you know we just enter one of the lowest tax environments we've ever seen what are you doing the best question you can ask\nYourself related to this is when is the last time that your financial advisor asked to see your tax return when is the last time if you think to yourself what's been a long time or never or it's been a few years fire them you don't need to ask\nYourself any more questions of whether it's time to upgrade your financial advisor or not\nBut this is your life savings if they are not helping you with your taxes you're missing out most likely on some massive opportunities because let's face it I mean most of your CPAs are calling you in the middle of the summer out of the blue this time of year saying hey I have some ideas on how to reduce taxes\nThey're probably not doing anything I'm Talking about right now is striking accord with you've anything that I'm Talking about right now is resonating with you go to key still well partners dot com and putting your basic information that you'd like retirement map review it's our one page roadmap it's our second opinion that we've done for hundreds of folks just like you remember my team will call you back\nFirst thing on Monday morning and schedule a ten minute phone call with one of our advisors where you can outlined some of your concerns your objectives\nAnd if we mutually think it would be a good fit we will build out that retirement ... it's complimentary it comes with no obligation so if you're listening right now and your advisor has not asked to see your tax return in the last year\nWith the largest tax reform since the Reagan years\nGo to keep the oil partners dot com right now and get a second opinion from us get a second opinion from an independent credential fiduciary not looking to sell you something but rather give you a clear and an understandable breakdown of exactly where you stand with your money\nAgain that the Keystone wealth partners dot com if your advisor has enough to see your tax return in the last year\nAnd here's another indicator signaling that it may be time to upgrade your financial advisor it's what I like to call the cocktail napkin test and that is is can you describe your investment strategy on the back of a cocktail napkin see our clients are key so well partners they can't many investors don't actually\nHave an investment plan instead they just have and this maybe you just kind of a collection of investments that you've added over the years it's kind of like you know the junk drawer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Myth Busting with Keystone Wealth Partners", "city":
