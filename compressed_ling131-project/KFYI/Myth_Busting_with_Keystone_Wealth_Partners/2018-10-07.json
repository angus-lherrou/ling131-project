you'd like that retirement map review it all starts with a phone call us at one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nSo you can call right now I have a team standing by one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nAnd they will simply schedule a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our credential financial advisors that you can just share what's going on in your life what your story is what you're looking for what your concerns are and if it makes sense for both of us will schedule in our visit\nFor you to get a second opinion and your entire life savings free of cost in an understandable clear breakdown on a one page retirement map that road maps your whole situation if you'd like get that process started again it's complimentary no obligation it's one hundred and seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen and then it was one hundred seven six seven\nFifteen Fifteen an hour let's start here with the first thing that we do not want to be surprised on when it comes to our life savings and that is taxes now wire taxes important well let's just start there the challenge right now with tax planning in America is a very few Americans do any sort of actual tax plan\nAnd what do I mean well this may sound familiar to you what comes in your mailbox January February march where your tax forms right and even on the envelope they do is the pleasure of St important tax documents and closed so you open it up and you start to file at your house and you start taking these statements your ten Ninety nine or W. twos and you start putting them in a folder\nAnd eventually by by march you flip through it and say this is everything I normally get and you take that and you grab your tax organizer and you drive down your CPAs office and you drop everything off\nHey how you survive and taxis and everything going okay like how's life okay well great let us know when we come back and sign and you hold your breath for a few weeks and you come back and he's signing you ask them how much you owe or what you're getting back\nAnd you take the file and you go put it in your home office and you dust off your hands and you go okay well perfect I gotta keep this three years for audits and until next year I guess I'm done with taxes\nOr if you do it on TurboTax you do the exact same thing but you just hop on TurboTax and file your taxes now the big problem with this is it nothing I described as proactive in any way nothing I described is going to reduce your tax bill moving forward\nBut that's what almost everyone does and the problem is most of your financial advisors I mean let's not be disillusioned when I worked on my master's degree I spent considerable time on tax and I don't say that to to my own horn but we focus\nA lot here accusing well partners on tax plenty if you have a financial advisor and I'm putting out of an air quotes if you have a financial advisor or a financial planner don't you think tax planning and your taxes is a massive part of your actual overall financial plan\nOf course it is it's huge\nAnd so if your financial advisors more interested in selling you investment products on behalf of their broker dealer than actually talked about tax or isn't an expert in tax when you got a problem because we just had the biggest reform and you have a massive opportunity because we have twenty trillion dollars of national debt and taxes just went down\nSo if you're a free and you might want to be asking yourself why should I continue to do so\nWhat bracket am I really going to be in under this new tax law\nAnd order pick this back up after the break but if you're listening right now and you're like I don't know who this John guy is and I don't know much about Keystone well partners but I'm not getting any tax advice I Want to make available to you our retirement map or if you ... you can call one eight hundred seven six seven\nFifteen fifty nine again the numbers one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen and have a team standing by right now to take your phone call\nAnd it's called the retirement mat for a reason it's our one page road map that overviews your entire financial situation and sometimes you're thinking you're several John it sounds kind of simple it's one page like is that too simple it is not too simple\nIn fact for most of you it'll be the first time you have ever sat down with an independent the only objective fiduciary whose putting your needs above selling the product so you can get an understandable and clear breakdown of exactly where you stand with your money and let me go over again the value that you get\nWhen you come in to meet with us the Keystone well partners we have offices in Chandler as well as Scottsdale and we will list all your concerns and objectives right on the map and then we'll put her recommendations on there as well and tell you what we think you could be doing to improve your situation\nAnd obviously you be the judge as to whether you want to act upon those things but this is going to provide you a retirement income protection\nAre you going to be okay and retirement will your income hold up and also are you taking those income distribution in the most tax efficient manner possible maybe even more importantly will help you answer the question what rate of return on your money do you need and retirement to accomplish all your goals\nBecause if someone needs a three percent rate of return they can invest very differently than someone who needs a seven percent ready to return\nTo accomplish their goals and the thing that we found here a Keystone in meeting with hundreds of folks just like you from the radio show\nWho've called in and requested this retirement preview very few people have any idea what that number is I mean how crazy is that\nWe don't even know what rate of return we need to accomplish on our money to accomplish our goals to fulfill the things that matter to us in our lives will tell you that on his retirement ... the last thing we're gonna provide you on the ... is a stress test\nWe've had a nine year bull market are you wondering am I too risky maybe you've been concerned about a drop and you move to cash or you know you've gotten very defensive and now you're asking yourself am I too conservative\nI'm not going to get enough growth of I Lived too long we will look at your risk tolerance and back tests that in times of heightened volatility to give you a feel for whether you have too much risk or not enough risk\nJust to ensure that you and your family will be OK regardless of what Trump tweets tomorrow and we've helped literally hundreds of investors many of whom have not become ongoing clients accused of well partners\nIt's perfectly fine this retirement map review is complimentary and comes with no obligation\nAs I said earlier weren't mature from and there's no pressure from us on whether you want to need our help moving forward in an ongoing way but I'm confident that all have left their retirement map review with more clarity regarding their situation so again a complementary retiring ever view is available to you by calling one eight hundred seven six seven\nFifteen

mentioned at the top of the show if you missed it\nI walked into my home last week to a Julie on a Piglet sitting in our family with our four year old yelling hey dad we got a pig we got a pig and I asked my wife why didn't you consult me on this Fifteen year commitment of a pig\nAnd she simply looked at me and if you knew my wife this is her she's adventurous\nShe is fearless she loves challenges she loves new things and exciting things and really living life to the fullest she inspires me but sometimes you just crazy stuff like this she looked at me and simply said I knew if I ask you would have said no\nAnd I jokingly said are you in kindergarten like we're married here this is a Fifteen\nYear commitment we have five kids\nHere's kind of a funny thing my wife said as a backtracked she said well John I mean the reality is there's a lot of petting says we'll take 'em if you know it's not working out or we can put your him a lot of people butchered their pigs and I looked at her mortified I'm a city kid from Seattle\nAnd I said okay so let me get district bringing even a year or two this pet that our children run around our acreage with you know the plane with the chickens and our dog and him are puppy and him are already hanging out sleeping together on the back\nPatio right so picture this by the way our puppy is maverick and my wife and the kid's name this Piglet groups so we've got maverick and goose little play off the top gun there\nFor those you top gun lovers so let me get a strict this pet names Goossen loves our other animals and our kids chase around and pick up and carry around right you're telling me that if at some point along the way I decide that I don't want to get up in the morning to take this pig out in that I don't want to care for this pig and it's too messy and whatever it is\nYou're telling me I can just tell the kids oh yeah goose isn't here anymore but we are going to have extra bacon this weekend\nYeah that's not going to happen but anyways I've gone on and on enough about that I mean it's I Apologize I'm just ranting about the Piglet because I walked into a Fifteen year commitment and we now have a pig and I know whether you like or don't like surprises generally speaking you know what you don't like surprised with is your life savings I've run into way too many people over the course of my professional career\nWho the reason they came into the U.S accusing well partners as they had been surprised by something that happened in their lives\nA transition occurred with their money in their portfolio with their lives that they weren't prepared for and they weren't expecting\nAnd I talked to already at the first part of the show a little bit about taxes and we do not want to be surprised by taxes but the problem is although we just had the greatest tax reform since the Reagan Administration very few of us have gotten any tax advice from your advisor so you've heard me talk about the retirement ... we offer a one page road map\nThat covers an overview use your entire financial situation we've done it for hundreds of radio fans and if you'd like to go to Keystone well partners dot com right now against Keystone well partners dot com click on the button that says you would like retirement apple view it comes with no cost\nNo obligation and the first step a member of my team will give you a call Monday morning and schedule a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our credential financial advisors were you can just share what's going on your life\nWhat your concerns are what your objectives are\nAnd then if we mutually determined it'd be a good fit you can come in and do retire ... have you with us which is an hour of your time and it costs nothing and there's no pressure from us we've done for hundreds of people who haven't become long term clients accused owns\nAnd you can get a second opinion on what you've worked your lifetime to say I want to make sure you are not surprised but here's the proxy if you are listening\nAnd your financial advisor has not reviewed your tax return since December which by the way December was the biggest tax reform I said it a hundred times now it was the biggest tax changes since the Reagan Administration\nIf your quote unquote financial advisor has not run mocked tax returns and reviewed your taxes\nI mean you might be sitting there thinking jumped by buys rather review my taxes in years they've never done it I don't know get the retirement map review from us\nTaxes just lower than we have twenty trillion dollars a day and most likely a bunch of your money is an I raise for one case for all three of these four fifty seventh tee SPs that have never been taxed before you have a massive opportunity between now and twenty twenty\nWhen this thing sunsets to get proactive on your tax when\nYou're likely never going to have rates as low as they are today for the rest of your life with are macroeconomic situation with Social Security under funded I'm Seventy five percent of our federal budget going for line items right now\nThat's ballooning an even getting higher if nothing's changed taxes are going to go up but we got a little window here to be very very proactive what are you doing about it and more importantly what is the person you're paying to be your financial advisor what are they doing about it don't be surprised go to Keystone well partners dot com\nClick on the button request a retirement purview but I Want to transition into the second area so taxes we don't want to be surprised on taxes number two what's the second thing that we don't want to be surprised unrelated to our financial lives fees fees\nSo do you realize and one of the huge reasons that I left my broker dealer four years ago and started Keystone well partners most of my mentors said John why in the world are you doing this I was already in the president's club as a young advisor at our broker dealer\nI was making more money at that time in my life than I ever thought of one and money was never the mode of it but my clients were happy I was doing well so most of my mentors said why in the world would you leave the broker dealer basically like do you hate money I mean if you cared about money this is the worst idea ever because why I was given up all the kickbacks all the commissions on investment sales\nBecause I told them I said I'm not going to do it like this\nFor the next forty years of my career my goal in life isn't to stack up a bunch of money\nIt's to do the best job possible with the gifts that the lord has given me\nAnd I want to connect with people in a way on their life savings to help them live out their best lives you know I Believe some of the best work that you'll do in your life is going to be retirement you know I mean long gone to the days in retirement where you get a gold watching a pension after forty years of work you go sit in a lazy boy with a heating blanket\nYou flip on reruns of matlock and seven years later you die I mean we're living indoor nineties and hundreds now and that's extending every year thanks to medical advancements so what I Believe is if you retire in your sixties you're going to have twenty thirty or forty years to use the gift that God has given you to make a huge impact in the world\nAnd I want to come along beside you and be a part of that our team here Keystone we are a group of purpose minded financial advisors we're Christians who love the lord and believe that our resources are a blessing from God and not all of our clients are also Christians and that's okay\nWe work with a lot of different people who have a lot of different beliefs but we work really well with people regardless of their beliefs that say you know what\nThis money I Want to use this in a way that not only enhances my life but those that we love those that we care about causes that we believe in\nAnd for me to do that for me to do the best job possible I knew that I couldn't be riddled with the conflicts of interest of middlemen who had their own agendas that didn't aligned with that great purpose that I have in my life\nThere are so much more we can be doing for clients that's meaningful that reduces cost and here's where I'm going with the fees most of you have no idea what your pain I Want you to think right now about your portfolio about your investments ask yourself this question get home that I asked her spouses question if you're married\nYou know what you're all in Costa is I mean you realize that most of what your pain is completely internal\nHad a client come in and I've used this example a couple of times on the radio show because it blew my mind we had this happen all the time but this is one of the most egregious we had a client come in perspective plant called off the radio show called our number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine that you hear me talk about\nThat is what this person did that I Want to retire map review and talking with her\nShe's been with her advisor for fourteen years and she said I'm paying three thousand dollars a year she had a million dollar portfolio she doesn't pay three thousand dollars a year which by the way was the only part of any of her fees that were line item down her statement so it makes sense she looked at instead I'm paying three K here", "year": "2018",
