{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Been attacked us but it has nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer or to get you out of it it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here\nAre based on what you said you because you didn't know you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they uh fronted the company but it's a superior court action a ... you know at this point uh I Would contact a lawyer\nA that's representing the or the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out\nAnd just say I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant right it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court have been dismissed ... lawyer actually gives a damn and views you as an instant is an innocent party here\nAnd you truly are uh\nThen there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent guy\nRight sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a lot of like\nYou know there's no there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter sue on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true\nBut it is an allegation is not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not count or sue but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you probably have to see a lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I wasn't then I write in a alert to the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes you do when the thirty days you have to follow the response and you need some help with that\nOn an avid attorney I could just be that\nMight do that yourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want to put some of that you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research ah that talks about the fences and their affirmative defense is\nBut uh it's yeah you can do it yourself or with a little bit of research I absolutely\nLorraine Hi Lorraine welcome to handle on law I bail yes\nI took my car on the habit that this is a pattern noise that my car and ethics lawyer they fix my brakes which were perfect when I took the car and driver Kay\nSure you have a case in and they you have to pay for\nAll right ah yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're going to get a fact that they didn't fix a the noise or you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battery and you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and uh I have no idea how that works\nBrian Hi Brian welcome ...\nWanted to ask you a for years whenever I see my dentist he's trying to uh\nTalked me into installing a bridge on a a I have an open more that ah I've been chewing on for ten years no no uh no problem [laughter] been trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a piece of cake\nFor three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do it three thirty five hundred dollars and part of that\nPreparation for bridge is you're going down the to write\nTo cheat on each side yes I have one that I've\nBeen in a structured and caring for three and a half we thought it was settled down it didn't [laughter] I've been on ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now and sent me to an end up on this\nYesterday and ah he says that I'm going to need to root canals that grounded proved them too much\nOr the hope is almost to the store\nOr that's lovely okay so what's your question\nSo his response of uh my original done a response is is just one of those things that happen\nYou know no it does at first so I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today when they're dental implant\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad too if you put it in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in the decades ago before implants were even around so I I have no choice ah but I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a I have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much his dental malpractice worth a but now you start going and doing all kinds of research\nFirst step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things that happened this is malpractice on its face\nAnd then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are in there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in pursuing\nI'm thinking as you are right now then get straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and if it's under ten thousand dollars a year go ahead and then there is no problem and go to small claims court and then the problem is going to\nBe you'd have to bring a dentist in there\nYou're gonna you're going to have to bring in a dentist a dental a dentist who's going to be a witness 'cause he's going to say in my professional opinion this is one of those things and it just went south and he's within the that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay and then I\nLet her be be appropriately being done of it then\nYeah maybe or bring in lots of them are bringing two or three and then see what the judge has to say\nOK okay alright traumatic yeah\nTennis is he spent all these years talking unit doing something went in in ... when you when you look at a dentist hockey when to anything you go to a dentist when you need a dentist\nI Know you've probably heard by now the new ...\nFacebook actually Facebook\nHas had to ... within a couple of weeks of each other and it's kind of crazy how many tens of millions\nOf people have had their odd information exposed to these hackers so uh well that's a good reason why lie flock is so important is certainly to me I've been protected by lifelong for over a decade and they pulled my chest nights out of the fire a couple of times\nWell let me tell you what life lock does which protects your identity they've added Norton Security which now protects your devices so malware ransomware viruses that is a their protection there is with Norton the identity theft is with\nA with life lock now no one can stop every cyber threat or prevent all identity theft or monitor every transaction in every business by new lifelong with Norton Security\nWell there are some added protection like has never been before going to wipe flock dot com recall eight hundred lifelike use to promote code handle for ten percent off your first year plus a twenty five dollar Amazon gift\n[noise] that's a eight hundred light flock robo code handle or visit lifelong dot com promo code handle\nThis is handle on the law [noise]\n\n\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the pro check their ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is home advisor is completely free do you\nTriple checking fuel levels looking at all of our tires walking around and doing a pre flight inspection like all of these things you follow all these checked with some flows as a pilot or have you know that but as an airline pilot when you get in the cockpit you have an entire flow and checklist you're working off of I don't care if you're a captain\nWho sixty three years old and it's been on that airplane for twenty five years with southwest on a seven thirty seven you are still going through the same checklist you have run for twenty five years now you could argue doesn't that person know already what the flow is they've done it thousands and thousands of times yes but we have to make sure that it's that thorough\nAnd there's checks and balances that's how important your flight plan is when you're going to safely take\nTwo hundred passengers or a hundred and fifty passengers from O'Hare to Phoenix it's that important\nAnd how important are our financial lives what you've worked for and save for for your entire life well it's really important but unfortunately most of these advisors out there are not really financial planners or financial advisors their sales people and I couldn't believe the fact that most people had\nNo roadmap they weren't getting in the airplane at the gate\nWith no checklist just kind of saying well\nI think today it sounds good to go to Santa Fe I'm not really sure what the active runway is yeah I guess that sounds good I'll hop on runway eleven it's bizarre and so I was adamant when I started Keystone we have to give people road maps we have\nTo let them know where they sit today where they're headed and how they get there and we need to be able to evaluate along the course where we go identify where we're at\nAnd so today on the show I'm going to break down some of the things that need to be on your roadmap some of the things that you need to be considering most you already working with a financial advisor I Want to make sure that you can evaluate while I'm Talking to double check that you have\nThese things in place and that's my first question to you today it's real simple do you have a road map\nDo you have somewhere right now that's written documented measurable to show you where you are to show you exactly how much money you have a different intervals of your life\nAt their current course when you should take Social Security what are your expenses what's your risk or how much deviation from year to year can you expect your account to go up and down by the week like\nTwo weeks ago where there was massive volatility were you prepared for that right that's just a thunderstorm rolling in above Houston at thirty five thousand feet you better be ready for that if it's July\nWe find a lot of people aren't a lot of people haven't even been taught about what happens when the thunder storm comes in there just flying with the autopilot on eating ... cookies dipping them and their coffee up in the cockpit and then they're surprised when they run right through of cumulus cloud and everybody in the back goes flying up and down in their drinks are hitting the ceiling okay I get it I probably taking this analogy way too far\nFrom heaven way too much fun with this by the way I Wish you could see me here in the studio I'm\nI'm laughing and I've I've got a huge smile because I'm able to tie and some of my airline passion for this myth busting show it's way too much fun I Know I'm kind of rambling here but I Want to make sure that with your entire life savings you have\nA map in place and you know what you're doing it sounds trite it sounds simple as I said earlier I think it's profound and its simplicity it seems pretty obvious that really with anything in life we need a roadmap not just with our money\nSo why wouldn't you want a second opinion get this roadmap put together tailored for you customized for you we've done it for hundreds of people just like you hear a Keystone while partners we have offices in Chandler as well Scott still\nThis retirement map review is our one page road map that overviews your entire retirement situation and sometimes people are saying well John it's one page it sounds too simple\nThis is not too simple in fact for most of you it'll be the first time you've ever sat down with an independent\nFee based objective fiduciary or the financial advisor who is putting your needs above selling a product to get an understandable and a clear break down at like ... where you stand with your money he let me go over again the value you get when you come in to meet with us it keeps them\nWe will list your concerns and objectives right on the map and then put our recommendations on there as well to tell you what we think you should be doing to improve your situation\nAnd obviously you'll be the judge on whether you want to act on those things additionally will provide your retirement income protection are you going to be okay and retirement will your income hold up and also are you taking those income distribution in the most tax efficient manner possible maybe more importantly\nWill help you answer the question what rate of return you need in retirement to accomplish their goals\nSomeone who needs a three percent right of return can invest differently than someone who needs seven and without having that knowledge it's very difficult for you to figure out\nHow much risk you should have will look at that you have too much risk not enough risk if an overweight scenario occurred what would that do to retirement what did the rail it if she doesn't Seventeen happened where the market just phenomenal or you capturing some of that growth what are your fees inexpensive\nYou recognize that most of what your pain is internal and hidden and less someone shows you you have no idea what your pain\nWill break that out on the retirement map reviews well Leslie working to provide a stress test will back test your portfolio in times of heightened market volatility\nJust to ensure that you and your family will be okay even when the market jobs even if we have a bear market a bad recession you'll be fine you'll be prepared for it you will be prepared for that thunderstorm all of this is available by calling one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen

come back we're gonna continue talking about how you build your roadmap for success [noise]\nAre you remember that first day when you met you shared some stories ask some questions and got that comfortable feeling so second date was set and then a third that's how the\nThe relationships are formed they start with a comfortable feeling pretty soon you build trust and that's so important\nDo you have that kind of relationship with your financial advisors if you don't I recommend having a first date with John ... and the team at Keystone well pardon [noise] on your first date you'll share some coffee in conversation and their office they want to learn about you and your family and they want you to get to know them\nA lot of financial professionals are only interested in your money John and the team it keeps them well partners are more interested in building trust but that takes time\nSo please call them today and for a zero seven oh two thirty thirty and set up that first day for both relaxed conversational that's the best way to get started calling for eight zero seven oh two thirty thirty\nKeystone well foreigners as a registered invested advisory for Keystone well foreigners and keeps them off of them are separate entity and must be engaged independently\nAnd [noise]\nWelcome back to the program thank you for joining me on miss busting with Keith on what partners I'm your host Jon hit send him a founder and managing director of Keystone well partners\nAnd we are in independent registered investment advisory firm with offices in Chandler as well Scottsdale and this is the show the talks all about your money the world of investing and most importantly how do you make sense of all the information that's out there\nIn a world where we consume info at work speeds it's more difficult now than ever before to have clarity and confidence in what you're doing and my goal\nIs to provide you an inside look at how our industry works through the lens of reform broker who started out with a broker dealer as a traditional advisor\nI saw everything that was right and wrong with the industry and that's why I started Keystone while partners I started it because I knew it could be better for you the conflicts of interest had to be removed people needed a roadmap they needed a plan that was in their best interest not their brokers best interest\nSo that you could have success from what you've worked your tail off to accumulate the last twenty thirty forty years of your life and you'll do we think is important here accuse the partners that we help you understand these things that we don't give you this jargon and these confusing spreadsheets and casual\nReports and money Carlos that your eyes are glazed over I Want to simplify things might go on this radio show is to provide you analogies and simple illustrations not because you can't understand it or you're not smart enough to understand it but because we like to make as an industry this stuff way too complicated\nOh we make it really difficult for anybody to understand any they were talking about and for a long time that was the goal of the industry because if you were a financial advisor you were a broker your whole job was to make sure your clients knew that they didn't understand what you were doing for them and that's why they needed you\nKnow I Hope that that shifting and people are realizing you know what I should actually understand the strategies that are in place for me I should understand everything I'm doing that a court level before I Do it\nAnd frankly we tell our clients are Keystone we say look you're not going to have the most a sexy strategies we're not going to put things together for you that you know we're not shorting again because Japan has been in this low inflationary environment\nAnd we're not going to call you with some hey let's short Netflix now yeah I mean you won't have the best story of the barbecue after church about your investment strategy\nBut you'll have an efficient strategy to low cost while diversified that you understand so you may not have to buy stories a cocktail party but you'll be able to flip over your cocktail napkin and explain to your friend and twenty seconds why you invest money that way you do\nFifteen Fifteen out again a member of my team will schedule a Fifteen minute phone call with you and one of our advisors at a time that's convenient for you get that Fifteen minute phone call and start your retirement ... view right now one eight hundred\nSeven six seven Fifteen fifty nine when we come back after the break we're going to continue talking about the things most important to include on your Taylor ... [noise]\n\nThis report is brought you buy true car breezy today with a slight chance of rain temperatures warming to the mid eighties and then overnight\nWho you love [noise] imagine being denied medical treatment because of who you marry [noise]\nImagine being a victim\nBecause of who you are\nMillions of Americans don't have to imagine that they have to live\nBecause in thirty one states it's illegal to discriminate against OJ PTA people get the facts behind I Do that or to you by the guild foundation and the ad council [noise]\nWe'll come back to miss a thing with those will partners hosted by John Hagen says John is the founder and managing director don't will partners top ranked independent investment advisor for the masters\nDegree in financial services [noise] professional certification from Stanford University\nIs a published author and regular contributor to local and national media publication and now here's miss busting with Keystone wealth partners\nWith good morning and welcome back to miss busting McHugh still well part of this this is the show for truth seekers who are fed up with outdated financial advice on John ... a reformed broker and it's my goal to reaffirm what you know to be true and to challenge the advice\nYou may have been told is true and today we're talking about something that seems quite simple but so few people actually have\nAnd that is do you have a retirement roadmap do you have a written documented measurable financial plan that helps get from point a to point B and can be monitored and tracked\nAnd evaluated along the way if you don't visit us the Keystone well partners dot com and do what hundreds of others have done schedule your retirement map review and get a one page tailored customized personalized roadmap at one of our offices here Chandler or up in Scottsdale again at the Keystone wealth partners dot com\nRequest your retirement map review\nAnd it all starts with a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our advisors that's what you're committing to when you go to our website a Fifteen minute chat with a credential produce you're related to your situation you know I talked about this little bit earlier but when I transitioned from an airline pilot to a financial planner and I know you're sitting there thinking you went from an airline pilot to a financial planner that\nThat is an odd transition but that's what I did\nAnd I went in very naive into our industry I had these grand ideas of how it was going to help clients accomplish their goals and the plans that I was going to build for people and as I went in\nTo the industry and I talked about this a little bit earlier on the show I was really quite amazed\nAt the lack of planning that was done the lack of the advising was done you see right now there's three hundred and ten thousand financial advisors other\nLess than five percent of them are true ... not operating within the context of a broker dealer not selling products on behalf of their broker dealer\nBut truly acting as a fiduciary and the best interest of their clients that's a very small percentage you know\nLike most of you when I started in the industry I sort of thought as a financial advisor I went in with this idea that well all these financial advisors out there are obviously operating in their client's best interest have removed conflicts of interest build really good plans for their clients\nYou know kind of operate more like a CPA would from an advice standpoint for their clients and run a lot of numbers and build out the plans and talk to him about their progress\nAnd unfortunately that's the rarity in our industry\nUnfortunately most of you listening right now are working with financial sales people what is your credentialing do you have a masters green financial planning are you a CSP like do you have a PHD an economics or like like what's your area of expertise and they say well no I mean I have an associate's degree in education and you're like oh wow but you throw it really awesome Christmas Party\nAnd you're a member of the country club and that's where you pick up all your clients\nYou see most of our industry are just great gregarious dynamics sales people\nWho convince people to buy investments for them to make commissions and sometimes those investments are good I'm not saying\nEveryone out there is trying to do the wrong thing I mean a lot of these people their intentions are great but they are not experts in financial planning they don't have any degrees or background in financial planning they don't do any planning other than\nThe bare minimum to induce a sale of something of some products it's going to pay them a bit commission and then there's very little monitoring of that along the way so since leaving my broker dealer I have dedicated my practice your Keystone an oldie advisors that have joined me here a Keystone\nWe've all left banks broker dealers insurance companies my whole goal is to pull back the curtain for main street Americans for you hardworking people trying to save and do the best job possible with your finances\nI just want to pull back the curtain on the industry and say\nThis is why the average American has made\nBarely over inflation I mean do you realize that\nThe average American has barely outpaced inflation for the last Thirty years but according to ...\nThe average Americans made about three point seven percent per year on their money for the last Thirty years\nWhile the S. and P. five hundred has made over eleven percent per year and why very few of us have any sort of road map guiding what we're doing Bobbie and and weaving and Swain with what ever or broker slash financial advisor comes up with this month\nWhat is your person been telling you the last couple of years has it been rooted in academics and discipline or has it been\nHey we kinda think this is going to happen with the market we like us stocks we kind of think small ... will be good international doesn't seem to be doing well values really been lagging behind so we're going to is there a strategy in place or is it what if they think is good today\nIs there a map in place is there an altitude put in is it being monitored and if you're even slightly unsure about the answer to that question\nDo the Keystone wild partners dot com and request a retirement map are you a member of my team will call you Monday morning and schedule a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our advisors if at the end of that phone call makes cents mutually for us to do retire map review for you we will build out at customized one page roadmap that's completely complimentary comes with no obligation\nAnd will meet with you and sit down and one of our offices either in Chandler Scottsdale to go through that with you just as we've done for hundreds of others\nWe address all the major components of your financial plan on that understandable one page break down\nAnd you can request that again by going to Keystone well partners dot com now what are the important things that you need to be monitoring and need to be on your lap when you're the first thing is\nDefining your destination where are you ultimately going for some people that maybe when is my retirement for others the destination may be a specific goal that you have in mind that you'd like to accomplish in retirement\nAnd how does your money play a role in that\nBut whatever it is what is the destination you better determine what that is because it's really difficult to know whether you need to start flying north south east or west if we haven't defined where we're going in the first place and wants you to find that destination we need to prepare for the flight what is preparing for the flight mean well\nHow are your assets out and look how were you actually going to mechanically accomplished your goals and get to that destination was vehicles are you going to use and\nHow have you aligned those with various weather conditions or mechanical malfunctions or somebody in the back having a heart attack while you're flying the airplane what are your contingency plans\nBecause the reality is you can prepare for your flight but you better also be prepared to adjust along the way owned by the way let's talk for a moment about adjusting along the way we had a bunch of volatility a week and a half ago and here's what people jumping in and out of the market or trying to\nDetermine what they should do next based upon what President Trump tweets tomorrow you here's what that's like as an ex airline pilots\nThat would be like me getting on the intercom and saying\nOh ladies and gentlemen from the flight deck we're experiencing some rough air please buckle up your seatbelts and stay seated for the remainder of the flight in right after I make that announcement somebody the emergency exit row on buckles their seatbelt rips open the emergency exit and jumps out of the airplane at thirty five thousand people know parachute\nProbably pretty unlikely unless the winds are really severe that they're ever going to make it to their destination with that strategy so basically they told you to jump out of the airplane and I saw some of these accounts they made like no money whatsoever and have made very little money over the last several years and one of the best bull markets we've ever had\nBecause what they said is jump out here's a parachute will swing back around and pick you up this will be much better much easier to get you over to Houston\nAnd what ended up happening is you jumped out of a airplane was perfectly mechanically sound with the skies completely clear and wins lightened variable you jumped out and then as you were flying parish shooting down to earth\nThe pilots are sitting there looking out the one show going [laughter]\nYeah Ken around on that one whether seems real what a beautiful day out here it passed me the best golf cookies and a dip in my coffee and you as you're flying down you're yelling up going wait I I don't think I should have jumped sorry to let you jumped out\nHow much money to that cost you you've got to have a flight plan you have to have a map\nYou have to know where you're headed you have to know where you started you better know where you're going along the way if you want to have long term success if you want to reach your destination and here he still what partners we called that road map that one page map or retirement map review\nAnd it's called the retirement that for a reason it's a one page roadmap that overviews your entire retirement situation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Myth Busting with Keystone Wealth Partners", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "21"}
