depends on how serious you're a medical issue is\nA ... but I think about a dollar\nI considered talking to an attorney Betty okay\nThere's enough money there that you want at least talk to a personal injury attorney and this is not one of those things where uh here's the medical bills and here's another thousand dollars a first of all I think you're gonna have a hard time even you know arguing the medical bills because he's going to come back\nAnd this is typically what happens with the ... and this is the insurance company of Michelin right this is not Michelin per se ... percent\nOh yeah you know I Do believe me you're you just started talking to them or if you're on your own or missiles going to go they're not going to a ... the guy that you're talking to is not going to write you a

have to do this kind of procedure oh Edie Edie\n... you've talked to earlier about this [noise] okay do you need a medical malpractice attorney that it's just that simple [noise] ah this is handle on the last\n[noise]\n\nNothing small or not your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation all huge their partnership even they\nWere not nowadays I just don't get the one on one partnership to help your business ground\nBecause with a reliable doubt PCs with NPR core processor you can focus on what matters now getting business down\nA seventh heaven by down to speak with an advisor today at age seven seven I doubt [noise]\nThese principles it's too important and mistakes are too high so call right now one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty not again the number is one eight hundred seven six seven one five five nine\nKey there is never good convenient time to make the sacrifice of saving it's far too easy to put things off until later this procrastination let me investigate the cost of procrastination a little more deeply\nIf you're Twenty years old and you want to raise a hundred grand by age sixty five again assuming that ten percent rate of return you realize you only need to save get this\nThirteen hundred and Seventy two dollars today so if you're Twenty years on you put one thousand three hundred and Seventy two dollars away today it will be an average rate of return to ten percent there'll be a hundred grand at age sixty five\nIt's crazy right it's almost a hundred times what you put in however if you're fifty today and you want a hundred grand you need to invest nearly twenty four thousand to obtain the same so instead of Thirteen hundred you have to put away twenty four grand\nThis is the cost of procrastination\nIt's not money that makes you financially successful it's time it's not timing the market it's time in the market\nThat makes you successful I mean think about that the number one thing you're used to all partners when I'm discussing things with clients in talking with clients and we're working with a lot of folks who are you near inter entering retirement will definitely work with some young professionals and business owners but I get the sort of this unique vantage point of talking with a lot of folks that are in their fifties and sixties\nAnd you know what the number one\nSort of regret and complained and reflection that many of our clients have when we're looking at their situation\nThe number one thing they say is I Wish I had started sooner I wished so badly I had understood this when I was in my twenties and thirties even my forties like would it help so much because I mean think about that you need a little over a grand today if you're twenty\nTo have a hundred grand at retirement missing about easy that is when you get the power of compound interest but again we have to recognize robber crash later so here's something practical\nA couple of practical things I Would tell you about saving the first and I think many of you realize this the first is really just automating your savings okay what this means is turn things on auto pilot obviously if you're saving into a retirement plan at work at comes right of your paycheck you should automate older you're outside saving and investing in the same way\nRight nowadays with online banking as a super simple just you can easily set up savings plans investment plans were they come out at whatever day of the month you want and they transfer money to the various accounts we do this for all of our clients\nIt's incredibly important because we are procrastinators if you have to proactively get out your checkbook which I mean shoot if you're a millennial you don't even know what a checkbook is probably but we're not going to write a check every month\nLike we're not going to do it the money's going to be gone you have to get it out of there and pay yourself before anything else happens just pretend you don't even have the money\nPut it on auto pilot another really easy way to save money which we practice personally Brittany and I do is anytime you get unexpected money\nThat you weren't planning on getting just immediately deposit that into your investment account you will be amazed over the course of five or ten years how much money\nYou actually were able to squirrel away\nAt ... and its money you're not expecting right the last thing is every time you get a raise that work as you continue to progress in your career you may make more money you may have the benefit of getting some raises are earning more money here's the easiest way to manage those raises\nTake half of the race and save it\nRight so if you're making a hundred grand right now and you get a raise and are going to make one twenty five takes twelve five and invest it spend the other twelve five so enjoy it like give yourself the benefit of being able to increase your lifestyle a little bit you know enjoy the fruits of your labor and your hard work because there is a balance between saving and enjoying stuff now I mean what's the point and\nYou know stashing up a bunch of money and are just dying with this big account that you've never enjoyed or did anything with so that's a really easy practical way every time you get a raise said half of it because you're not going to miss it you didn't have it before anyways plus you get to increase your lifestyle\nIt's a great way to kind of battle procrastination so number one again number one automate all your savings know you're a procrastinator the first step to you know healing is admitting so just know that you're a procrastinator automated\nNumber to save anything that's unexpected you get something that you weren't expecting maybe a tax refund you were thinking of an old money on your taxes you got three thousand back don't go spend it\nJust immediately put an investment account number three every time you get a pay increase or raise save half of it\nAnd I'd like to offer the next five colors the opportunity to come in and get our tailored retirement map of you\nKnow it's called the retirement map for a reason it's our one page road map that

weekend\nIf you're joining us via the podcast on iTunes or through our website at Keystone well partners dot com however you're listening to wherever listening thinks a lot\nFor making us a part of your day and on today's show we're discussing the for primary landmines that impede our progress as investors and they may be very different than some of the ones that you\nWould think at first thought would be true\nWe already covered procrastination and spending habits and if anything that we discussed raises questions in your mind maybe this is your first time listening to the show you just stumbled across it maybe you're someone who's listen to the show for months or even years but you've never taken a stop on a retirement map review\nOr complementary one page road map that gives you a second opinion an overview on your entire life savings\nIf that's something that you think would be valuable but I mean the first land mine we discuss was procrastination\nIf this is something you think would be valuable don't procrastinate any longer\nWe make it very simple the first step is a phone call\nWe have a team standing by right now one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nOr getting a number one eight hundred seven six seven\nOne five five nine and their objective is simply to get you scheduled for a ten minute phone call with one of our credential financial advisors where you can express some of the things that you're concerned about some of the things that are on your mind and what you're looking for\nAnd if we think our process could be helpful well then take the next step which is a sixty minutes sit down is sixty minutes of your time worth it for a second opinion everything you've worked your lifetime to save of course I'm biased but I think it absolutely is and it all comes with no cost and no obligation again the numbers one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine to schedule your one page\nRetirement map review call right now again that number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nIn the past couple of weeks on the podcast I've been discussing some of the land mines that trip us up in having financial success\nFirst of which was procrastination and last week I discuss how we're spending habits may impact or long term goals\nToday we are going to discuss the third landmine up before most impactful hurdles\nIn us accomplishing our goals and it's absolutely appropriate right now and it's very relevant because it's something that is being discussed over and over in the news and that is inflation\nSince Nineteen twenty six inflation has averaged three percent per year according to the United States Department of labor and to put that in perspective or money must double every twenty three and a half years\nTo keep it consistent standard of living consider how much money you spend each year on everything food clothes furniture children's needs transportation housing what ever that amount is what ever that monthly dollar amount is you're going to need to double that\nIn twenty three and a half years just to keep pace\nWith your current standard of living with the way you live life right now so imagine if you're fifty years old\nWhen you reach age Seventy three Seventy four you're going to need twice as much income just to live the same lifestyle that you are right now assuming\nThat period represents a normal inflationary time period\nNow let's look at this historically I mean think about it for a forty year old by the time you reach your mid eighties you're going to need four times as much money as you have right now just to keep up with inflation just to live the same lifestyle that you are right now and how does this impact us as investors\nWill you must take action to grow your money to be sure that it can keep up and meet your needs so here's a little self assessment if you are not saving\nIf you are not receiving regular pay increases at work\nIf you don't have money invested in vehicles that will beat inflation or respond positively during inflationary time periods or if you are not earning regular adequate rates of return on your investments you are losing money\nIt's not just that you're not growing it as efficiently as you'd like do you are actually losing money\nNow in a low interest rate environment like we've seen since the financial collapse in two thousand and eight oftentimes savers or people that we referred to in our industry is safe money investors you know maybe a felt secure and the fact that they weren't losing any money in bank accounts or short term interest bearing accounts but unfortunately\nThey're real rate of return relative to inflation has been absolutely negative\nI remember every twenty three and a half years on average you need to double your money just to create as much retirement income as you enjoyed in the past but it practical analogy I just wrote an article for the hill last month specifically on inflation\nSo let's look a practical example of this put a frog in boiling water and it will instinctively jump out\nPut a frog in tepid water and slowly increase the heat to a boil and it will not perceive the danger an intern be cooked a death\nYou know at least that's the premise for a late nineteenth century fable that serves as a metaphor for our inability an unwillingness to react or be aware of threats that arise gradually and that subtle threat regarding our money a president is none other than inflation\nThis is something not only is it a landmine that I write about my book that's relevant throughout history throughout marking environments but it's particularly important to us right now\nAnd if you hear anything on today's show that is of interest to you maybe raises the question you're wondering how that applies to you you can reach out at any time wanting a hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine to request your one page retirement map review again the number one eight hundred\nSeven six seven Fifteen fifty nine we call it a retirement map of us are one page roadmap\nThat overviews your entire financial situation and if you've never sat down with an independent film and credentialed produce Sherry we have offices in Chandler as well Scottsdale and we have performed this review for hundreds of radio fans just like you looking to get a second opinion on what they've worked so hard to save\nWondering what the first step in our processes we make it quite simple it's a ten minute phone call with an experience financial advisor where you're able to share your goals and your concerns and in turn will let you know how we think our process can help you progress and your financial situation\nAnd the first step and our retirement map review process is scheduling a ten minute phone call with one of our credentialed producers that allows you to share a little bit about what's going on of your life and we can tell you whether we think our process will help you again if you want to call in one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine at any point during the show\nYou'll talk with a member of my team was standing by twenty four seven to take your call and get a ten minute visit with one of our credential lose yours scheduled at a time it's convenient for you\nSo at this point it's not anecdotal it's not we're in a low interest rate environment and we'll rates increase John I'm not really sure I'm sure they will long term because we've been talking about rate increases for several years now but now they're actually happening they've already taken action the Fed's already taken their foot off the gas pedal and started to raise interest rates\nWith three or four more expected it's happening\nAnd so what do you do in a rising interest rate environment like we're seeing right now we're inflation is expected to take off I mean we know every twenty or twenty five years our money has to double\nBut now more than ever we better be prepared\nFor rising interest rates and so what are a few things you can do will avoid long term bonds long term fixed income rising interest rates means falling bond prices but not all fixed income investments are created equal the longer until your bond matures the more drastic the decline as the rate increases\nSo for many the plan to mitigate this interesting risk consist of simply avoiding the urge to sell bonds on the secondary market it all off so if you own bonds I Know I'm getting a little bit into the weeds here but if you own bonds\nAnd you think well I'm just going to hold them until maturity John ... I don't care if interest rates rise because I'll just let the mature not so fast", "show_name": "Myth Busting with Keystone Wealth Partners", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "28"}
