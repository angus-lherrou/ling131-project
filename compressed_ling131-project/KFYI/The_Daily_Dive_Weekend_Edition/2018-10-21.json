and we'll see you next week at the same time\nThey're\nProceeding has been paid programming [noise]\nTo one\nOf them out\nFive times the most iconic brand of the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now pi times the best\nMost clean October twenty four and perform that one of my camera county falling on\nPurpose seven seven seven votes out or if I'm voting hours at a local and [noise] she's lost a little less wholesome by checking website up all the time [noise]\nDuring early voting from ... from Kenya voted harmful\nAnd what's really striking about it if\nIt's this comes out to be the case if they do report that indeed I show she died while in Saudi custody or civil you know let's not forget the Saudis originally said that\nHe was fine and he left so it shows the apparently they lied from the beginning and if they now say well we only meant in parody him\nWe didn't lead to kill him it was an accident I I guess that's not out of the realm of possibility it's something that President Trump I'm listening to indicate that it's the story that she would accept and it's not impossible any because because the studies all that they do have a history is perhaps China\nHoax people come back to the king more rendition them a ... and they don't really have a history of killing people\nIf he dies because of harsh interrogation techniques let's just say something pretty serious it's not like they were\nProbably just turn it into this takes that step further and where the body\nOne of these people that apparently went in had a bone saw that's why they think that he was dismembered and the president has made that Saudi Arabia one of our allies in that area the reports are that\nJared Kushner is very close friends with the crown prince also and you know they're trying to open up the area to business and things like that so I don't know if it would put a halt to it but it would really severely impact what's going on there\nAnd it's an extraordinary them I'm I'm being told though that like inside idea right if people are a bit frustrated with it because they're saying the Saudis have stayed with the United states has so many different things we cooperate with them on every level why should this one\nGuy that one incident got all all that and there's no indication in the ministry ... by any means and the relationship what I mean that's not even I don't think any administration would necessarily do that over and over that\nBut you have to remember it's not just any other opinion writer jealous I mean this guy is very prominent he knew people in many many people in the U. S. foreign policy community he wrote for a very powerful newspaper and also you know frankly like when it comes down to it often when you have a single face\nOr single name that often captures the imagination of the public for more than when you say a thousand people were killed today in this war you know [laughter] so it becomes very emotional issue I Know members of Congress are very very upset about this on both sides I mean they're really mad about\nThis and we're still waiting for any type of evidence are saying that turkey might have a lot of evidence but they're not sharing any of it just yes and the people that hurts\nOr not the most reliable married or either they have like a ... everything that\nA lot of people are making something out of her show jeeze apple watch saying that he set it up to record and it went back to the cloud into his iPhone which is fiance had and there might be some type of recording of what that interrogation sounded like\nYeah but the other theory on that is that for the one that three out there because they don't want to admit that they had this study on what wired ...\nForeign affairs correspondent for Politico thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me\nThere has been a ton of developments since that interview that we did with in the hall the kind of sets up with the whole story is about after that Turkish officials were leaking all sorts of stories to the media part of it was they said they had audio recordings of what happened inside the Saudi constantly\nThey said that Mr ... was dead within minutes and within two hours\nAll of the killers are gone there so there was a Fifteen person hit team that went in there Miranda tell us what some of these gruesome details or because\nIt plays like a spy movie all this secret shady stuff happening in these political consulates you know it's crazy the secrecy that happens in there that they think that they can get away with this kind of stuff what are some of these details of how they say he died\nYeah and like you said there were Fifteen people waiting for him for hours to show up and they knew what they were going to do they have this all planned out from the beginning and like you said he was dead within minutes they separate his fingers and cut his head off\nAnd asked they cut off his head and dismembered his body there was a doctor a forensic who had been brought along so that he could assist with the defection and the disposal of some of the body parts and he had some advice for them including one was to listen to music as he put his own headphones on because that's what he like\nTo do to try to ease the tension when quote doing such work\nThey said that he was dead within minutes but how quick and fast the torture was you know I'm assuming well and what were those minute flight right exactly I'm assuming some of those minutes were spent cutting fingers off or wants to cut off your head that's kind of that's the end of it\nBut yeah for the doctor to want to be wearing these headphones and listening to music just so drawn up be craziness of what's going on in front of you is just ridiculous there\nAre reports that the one of the members of the Fifteen Percent assassin team world in there with the bones are right that is going to make some a gross noises exactly you don't want to hear\nThis is turning to just a mess on the diplomatic side\nThe United states is struggling with how to respond to this the world is crying out that Saudi Arabia and the crown prince was directly involved in this new Trump Administration wants to tread very lightly they are an ally we do a lot of business with them they buy a lot of weapons from us in the billions of dollars\nAnd the president doesn't want to endanger that President Trump spoke to reporters and acknowledge that it certainly looks as though he's dead now what else did the president saying how what else is going on in the administration\nIn addition to his comments that quote certainly looks as though\nHer show James is dead he threatened very severe consequences if the Saudis are found to have murdered him and before he spoke treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin pulled out of a major upcoming Saturday investment conference\nMike Pompeo has been over there interviewing people trying to figure out what's gone on and he even advised that the Saudis should be given a few more days to finish and make public they're credible investigation before\nThe U.S decides how or if they want to respond\nTo give him a few more days to think about how they want to cover this ... I mean there's still a lot of evidence now they're releasing video surveillance of this Fifteen person hitting walking in to the consulate walking out you know with a huge briefcase will get into some of those details in just a minute\nWe never saw ... walk you know and\nHe never walked out himself this investment conference that's happening there and uh see my new and pulling out there's all sorts of companies that have pulled out just saying we can't do business with you until we know what's happening nobody wants to do business with killers\nAnd this is a major blow to them because at this point with the crown prince coming into power very soon they're portraying him as a reformer he's very good friends with Jared Kushner he's trying to open up the country to a lot of new investment and this was just totally uh throwing a wrench into it my palm pales telling him\nYou need to have a credible investigation and a credible answer to all this or you're not going to be a credible king when your time comes\nAnd it's important that you bring up that Jared Kushner connection because he is one of those people who the top aide to President Trump he's been in President Trump's ear and they can kind of hear that conversation that they've had when President Trump spoke to the media on Thursday about what's going on with the investigation because\nTrump emphasized the billions of dollars in weapons to Saudi purchases from the U.S and all of the money that exchanges hands between two countries\nYou're listening to the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar mirrors and when we come back we'll finish explaining the story of ... ... and ... explain how Saudi Arabia plans on blaming an intelligence official for the killing\n[noise] fantastic\n[noise] addiction shuttered too many law than broken the hearts of too many families\nIt's time for toughness oversaw\nConsignment center and now their entire jewelry collection one of my rings is there as well that's ... dot com from the big name luxury brands and you know which ones I'm Talking about to the unique designers that you just can't find anywhere else all at a fraction of the price\nAnd with free shipping visit gasoline dot com today and see what the buzz is all about I'm going back on ... dot com tonight\nYou know our Jimmy Johns new nine grain wheat some as a perfect amount of grain first yeah interior conversation about how Saudi Arabia plans to blame on intelligence\nOfficial for the killing of Jamal\nJoe ... [laughter]\nSo what are the rulers of Saudi Arabia considering where are they trying to place the blame on this\nThey want to blame one of the crown prince Mohammed top intelligence officers and the planets assign blame to major general Amman our theory he's a high ranking advisor to the crown prince and blaming this general would provide\nA reasonable explanation for the killing and try to deflect the blame from the prince because American intelligence agencies are very convinced\nThe crown prince was the one who was behind demolish oh jeez disappearance\nThis stuff doesn't just happen there are no rogue agents for the most part in Saudi Arabia these things come from the top down direct orders and things like that so that's what makes this much more interesting how they're trying to place blame on this general\nThere James Sierras\nI'm Oscar ... and we're running down some of the top stories of the week and don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nI think one of the stories that's captured everybody's attention this week is that of the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also I think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery\nMiranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call\nAnd I think I'd call my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been in Samy mouthy forever [laughter] and so she's the only person who would not try to get money out of yeah and she would know that people to call the problem with that last over generations\nThat's funny that I mean I thought you were to say something like hey now I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter]\nI I mean I might say that the experts say that the first person you shouldn't be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of stuff\nThat you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announce you can't get away I think there is only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know good luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million ... for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really and that ... followed by Fifteen zeroes so I miss the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer for us and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning big I spoke to a uh chasing Carlin he's an attorney based in union New York he's actually the self proclaimed lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners ... eleven\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say he's the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically protected them from a lot of the pitfalls of winning so much money and such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars is still a ton of money\nOne of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it's like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jackpot for the mega millions was also pretty large so people the the question that I Will get most frequently is tonight claim my jak anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to and encouraged us to file what's called the public record request and through that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game\nSo we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on the statewide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow the or an entity to claim the pride Ryan James carry his his name the director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nWow I I guess may maybe the only thing in that is that you could do a lay your name coming out because the the trustworthy L L C might get first billing and there is only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota\nOhio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere\nYou're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately before you announce close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skip town if you can write a letter to announce it so that you're not there and you know you work in the media as you've seen when\nAnything major happens in the news the media starts hunting down any pictures that they can of you or you know all the details because everybody wants to know\nSo you know some experts is that close all that stuff down just to help avoid it\nThat's one of the first tips that I've gotten from multiple experts is yet tried to get off social media because like you said that's the first place that not just reporters look but people that might want to start contacting you for money for charity and that's another issue is that you know a lot of charities that\nWill tend to reach out to jackpot winners they all digital ... but then there are a lot they're bogus that's what they think Carlin the lottery lawyer was telling me is you know you kinda have to keep it to yourself in more weight in more ways than just one not just a matter of not talking to people and telling them about it but\nYes scrub your social media if you can if you have your phone number out there and try to get it down just so that\nAgain like you said kind of lay people doing that 'cause especially in New Jersey inevitably it it's probably going to happen and your name will be out there but at least maybe stave it off for a little bit\nRight and you know as far as like skipping town and all these all these steps the initial interest is there as soon as the name comes out so hopefully after the news cycle switches a little bit\nMaybe you can kind of get away with being so popular ... if if you take the proper steps what about the office pool because we do that here at work and thankfully the\nPerson who kind of runs the office pool for us is very transparent with everything she always takes pictures of all the tickets very clear with everyone we split everything no matter what the prizes but I Know that people run into that problem a lot trying to claim while I got this ticket or that was my money and different things like that\nThere's a few issues with that and that's actually one of the biggest pitfalls that the lottery lawyer mentioned to me is first of all a lottery tickets what's called the ...\nWhich is basically just a fancy term to say that the holder is presumed to be the owner\nSo if you have a ticket that's the ... you know the winning lottery tickets and let's say you drop it in the street someone picks it up and find the back of it it's now their ticket whoever picks it up and signs that is their tickets so the issue that comes into play with office pools is that you know people chip in cash to buy these lottery tickets and then when one of the ticket holders ends up winning\nIt kind of ended up being a messy brawl figure out who's actually entitled to the prize money so the best way to prevent any kind of litigation or issue to begin with is to make copies of each of the ticket that were purchased and then send a specific ticket numbers to people in the office pool in an email thread\nThat way you have at least some kind of a paper trail right\nSo if we're there to be um luckily some kind of litigation\nA judge could look at that email and say well it says right here in writing that this with your ticket and this was your ticket and so on and so forth so\nBut what's amazing about it is almost all equity in houses\nNow part of what's driving the equity in houses is\nThe root for real estate mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again a big key in the top when you have this much margin debt\nWhat happens is is that is people borrow more and more money to buy stocks so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it so you borrowed the rest of it well as their stocks go up in value you get more borrowing capacity so you don't actually\nHave to solve the stocks so all this money gets created in that creates demand\nNow at the same time companies are buying back their own stock which is limiting supply so this pushes stock prices up and you have this ... this virtuous cycle as people get more borrowing capacity to borrow more money they don't have anything else to do with the money 'cause nothing else was give them a decent rate of return so they keep buying more and more stocks\nBut what always happens in these cycles is it that when the fed starts raising interest rates than all of a sudden the margin dead doesn't become as attractive as it used to be and I actually saw a thing today that if you're borrowing less than about fifty granted Schwab on margin right now it's costing you nine to ten percent\nOkay that's a big number and all of a sudden that isn't as attractive as stocks aren't going up so fast you combine that with again you know a big change in the house in ... this fall and all of a sudden social mood starts changing\nPeople aren't as optimistic there's not as much confidence it's two years of what you've just been through on the cabinet hearings only is going to feature Mr Trump and everybody he knows\nNow again you may think that's what should happen and that's all fine you're entitled to that opinion and I'm not here to argue it one way or the other but I'm going to tell you can have a tremendous impact on the stock market because all of this revolves around confidence and it will be crushing the confidence and the fact that may be a strategic move by the people on the other side\nBecause if the economy's not doing well it's going to be a whole lot harder for the Republicans to win and twenty twenty but that's kind of the big view on all of this\nThe smaller of you is that you've got very little cash left on the sidelines is getting more expensive for people to borrow money to buy stocks and when that happens people stop borrowing so much that takes away demand\nWhen you take away demand that when companies have to borrow a pay more to borrow money to buy back their own stock\nWhen mortgages go up and now housing prices have to come down to reflect the increase in mortgage rates all of a sudden the economy starts turning that turns very quickly and again in two thousand and eight when the market crashed at last forty percent of its value in a month\nIt was Thirteen Years of gains in Eighteen months\nThat is very likely in my opinion something on that magnitude is inevitable I can tell you when it's going to start but I can tell you you're seeing a lot of signs of the top right now now companies may continue to buy back their stock next year because they haven't spent all the repatriated money\nBut earnings are starting to get weaker this quarter GDP forecaster being lowered around the world\nYes you've gotten through the NAFTA deal but you still have a lot of issues with China Italy as a basket case and they're going to have big problems with the ... you and you may end up with another you know group wanted to Italy may want to leave the EU sometime this year\nAll of these things can take this market down very quickly and getting back to the first idea\nPeople always tell me that their investors and I would argue that they're not\nGetting their gamblers because they don't really understand what they own why they own a they just heard it was a good company or their study says it was a good company but they don't really have a plan of what happens when I'm wrong and we're going to always be wrong because these things all change\nYou know we think about ten years ago the greatest company out there to buy for the long term was was blackberries called ... back in the day\nIt was trained for a hundred and forty dollars a share it was the dominant cell phone company you can be president you didn't have a blackberry you couldn't be secretary of state unless you had Thirteen blackberries I mean just for convenience but be that as it may\nThe problem was is that apple came along with a new phone and an Android came along and all of a sudden this dominant company got crushed this long term can't lose proposition lost and that stock went from a hundred and forty bucks a share right now I think is trading Ron ten or eleven and it's not going to come back\nAnd this is the other thing and I'll go through this with you guys in class when stocks fall they almost never come back you know people talk about why by these you know good dividend paying stocks okay in a blue chips okay well Ford is is still down Seventy five percent gee is down eighty percent and it keeps tanking\nI have a problem with getting my or hydrocodone from our these

it looks like it is straight out discrimination show there doesn't seem to\nBe a a lot of uh a lot of doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and\nYour boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that ... that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot of a just a tremendous amount of power for example I Know the company\nThat had a and it's a company that is in it's in the spotlight I mean it's that people know about this company\nAnd there was an issue a day and African American who was working there and I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two or three people\nWhat they did is they just shut down the entire division and I literally and said everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you gonna go with that well you shut down the division because you are a bunch of racist I Know we\nShut down the division as a as a business decision uh-huh see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nMy performance was better than the three repaired but together but that's\nWhat you say that prove that\nBut he but even so it's I think I division part is going to be a horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't mean that she's going to say that you are in subordinate I she doesn't judge said that it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh Laura how how's your Hebrew\n[laughter] horrible now you see I work on that a lot truly [laughter] All right Laura\nThat yeah I mean it's it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was a good bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason\nLet's say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof Syria is a you know what I learned when a fire you today I'm your boss or just don't like any more boom you're gone with no rights\nSo\nUh
