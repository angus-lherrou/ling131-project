along and share this with us and and work streaming\nThat's what the government because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their ...\nAnd as you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to buzz your phone\nWhenever he wants to just to clarify if not the president sitting in his office and saying I'm gonna send out this alert no ... there's a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis was a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's going to be on a news station\nBut it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally it's really about how to use it and then obviously what the emergency is hopefully aliens don't invade us\nRight in the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something happens\nAnd in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time so that I can talk was half forgot about that there is among strange history of emergency alerts thanks Miranda think he wants to go and\nYou're listening to the daily died and weekend edition I'm ... and we'll be right back with more with\nNext step is my favorite story of the week really I Love stories about bank robbers and bank robberies it takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it\nThis guy in particular has an interesting story he won the lottery hit it big one Nineteen million dollars and then blew through all of his he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you're actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nI'm a Santa Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he hit were in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks was this peachy crews are banned it it was completely captivating and I'm ready for like the Martin Scorsese as he does tell us style movie about this guy\nI remember seeing a lot of news stories about it when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him to P. T. crews are bad at it was his getaway car uses the stolen money that he got from the bags to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking who was the P. T. cruiser banded Jim have\nOh Jim have was a security guard who back in the late nineties one night the million dollar and the California state lottery and\nOver the course of the next two decades sort of amazingly and managed to\nLose it all and then after losing it all came\nPretty accessible bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before he wouldn't then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I just had been talking with Han he's in prison now and writing letters so he kind of ended up telling me everything that happened in between the time that he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we hadn't gotten her pour his lawyers and told me you know I\n... going to be the kind of guy wouldn't mind telling his story\nSo why don't you send him a letter in prison in just a clean up for it he had already pled guilty and he was waiting for\nSentencing hearing at the point that I contacted him so he basically before we started talking wanted I wanted to wait until he had been sentenced in K ... thing and the article came out that he felt like you know maybe made him look bad so basically I just wrote him a really personal handwritten letter saying\nHey I Am fascinated by what I've read about you know I Want to know more can we talk can we can we kind of be pen pals and he brought me back and then I send them all that stuff like five or six questions and stuff and he might get back to me and he brought me back\nTo the plate really amazingly like up the letter with\nLike a really good sense of humor and like a lot lot of exclamation points just not what I expected it all like in terms of tone right\nSo I was like oh man now even more fascinated by it because you don't seem to be found out about the fact that now you're doing great I'm all for years in federal prison it kind of has this happy go lucky even now kind of attitude which\nAfter everything you've been through ... well let's start with some of the good stuff and so he won Nineteen million dollars in lottery I was actually Thirteen point seven million wants taxes were taken out a climate of its own so you got a shortage about five million dollars out of that\nHe was getting twenty annual payments of about six hundred eighty four thousand dollars every year what did he spend money on what was that life like after he hit it big\nAt first it was a super extravagant ... I think a total of at least that meant ... exotic sports cars they had\nHarare Atlanta ... is that when I mean like a Barry into cars and so gets dumped a ton of money into that\nI think it was might have been his first wife who said that all that money changed him and he had this hot seat taught the attitude after he was\nAlone yeah that was his long term girlfriend she saw haven't changed she met him I think when they were a teenager and Seventeen and they and together for Fifteen Years and so she hadn't changed towards the end of their relationship\nHe was a parting with actors he had a personal photographer at some point which I thought it was pretty interesting\nYou said he race lamborghini's with Mario Draghi and everything whatever you're going to do to live life to the fullest beachfront houses actress girlfriends that whole thing is what he was all doing so and that's what happened to it later on the article someone was saying\nThat is what happens to these people they hit it big there thrust into like another subset of social life now and they're not ready for it and they don't know how to really interact in that when they come up with so much money\nIs actually yeah and the way that his second wife explained it to me with\nThat look you know he's the guy from kind of a middle class upbringing even working charity failed he really had no sort of concept of wealth management\nPoint and the lead investigator who kind of starting to get on and at this point that All right he failed I Know he's going to hit against them and I know from\nThat now that I haven't gone out that I have\nA pretty good hunch that he located all along with same thoroughfare because here and we're all the thing that connects all the bank so after\nThat failed robbery and they set up\nA camera along the highway\nAnd basically we're just looking for that knowing that he was probably going to strike and knowing what his vehicle was set it up and then we'll go in and evidently he hit again and I don't think it it wasn't too much later in terms of the timeline and it was\nDefinitely less than a month and then knowing that he hit again just think that up with Ryan line and when the bank had occurred and then went through\nThe camera footage they got a\nA help from a tip you know the bus at his house was very dramatic he was walking out of the garage and they turn it in with a are safe teams and clock pistols and got him in boom that he was arrested in or being sentenced to thirty three months in prison three years of supervised release after that we know when he would get out\nAnd he had to pay back the money in restitution his release date is February twenty third twenty twenty so he still has a little bit of time in there what does he been doing with his time there and what are his plans after he gets released he's\nBeen making art in prison trying every letter that he sent me had like some sort of elaborate picture on it like one hadn't Garfield on it and he was a cat and\nOh you have to some of those on Twitter or something I've been so people can\nHe wants to publish a book at the end of this right\nHe's working on a on a book I Know that he's like playing softball Ethan exercising and that is kind of like tap into his force ... side he has a funny like optimistic view of all that now and he said like look I'm clean and sober now yeah kind of like fourth day talks for\nThe better he even said himself that it helped him more so than the money ever did and that's what I mean I Love these stories it's\nThat rise and fall it's coming into something and you know everybody internalize as like what would you do how would I react this happened to me and it's just a crazy story from\nBeing on the highest highest to being so desperate that you have to turn to a bank robbery and then obviously you know you get caught you know nobody ever gets away with anything at the end of it Natalie O'Neill contributor for the Daily Beast and freelance journalist thank you for joining us thank you\n[laughter] [noise]\nDon't forget to join us on social media at daily got pod on Twitter daily diet to talk to us on the\nLeave us comment if it's a rating and tell us the stories that you're interested in\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts [noise]\nI'm Oscar ... and this is the daily died weekend edition [noise]\nStudy so I thought the most\nWe have to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nNobel Prizes were also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting a Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in medicine physiology or medicine it went to two people Dr James Alison and to a Sudoku on Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs immuno therapy quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking him who were these Nobel Prize winners James Alison ...\nOf them of specialized in immunology studying the body's immune system this turned out to be a critical\nPart of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective or effective in certain situations but\nBut it can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells ... along with cancer cells will so that caused the causes all sorts of complications joined back about Fifteen Twenty years\nThere was another ... advance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutations in kids are so now this immune based approach that sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating catcher in the long time\nThese two scientists working separately but in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that if used certain kinds of drugs to target the immune system cells that have certain\nWay it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells of T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nThat I mean what's so interesting about what they discovered\nWas that the body's immune system has sort of its own natural check points or break so that it doesn't go overboard and attack the healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figured out how to exploit that and so they in some way they sort of a latch on to the break\nAbout his immune system in a way that helps him ... describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off with the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he used to be true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think that a lot of people have become aware of that all through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taking the true to an yes for TV commercials now are promoting\nThe use of TiVo and keep true to I think primarily lung cancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drones has shown some problem is\nThe evidence of the top and the market one is the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial public offering to ... cattle more companies that have no profits than ever in history\nSo Wall Street journal today to eighty three percent of the company's going public right now have an earnings have gone public the last twelve months no earnings\nIn two thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent so that again is kind of big bubbly science\nNext big bubbly sign is the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals okay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines than they've had an ad I think it any time in history if I remember correct\nBut they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people have barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stocks that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy\nSo what's happening is people are taking the money they have and buying stocks because most people are massively behind the eight ball you know I saw stay on the other day\nThat if you look at people even in their sixties the average person has something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere with all due respect in retirement\nTo really get to where most people need to be you're talking millions which means most people aren't going to get where they need to be you can still do better but you know most people are going to be in the hole on that\nBut a hundred and Seventy five it's not close\nBut what's amazing about it is almost all equity in houses now part of what's driving the equity in houses is\n... ... real estate the mortgage rates are so low but they're going up and here's kind of again a big key and the top when you have this much margin debt\nWhat happens is is that as people borrow more and more money to buy stocks so like when you buy stock you don't have to put up all the money just put up half of it so you borrow the rest of it well as their stocks go up in value you get more borrowing\nCapacity so you don't actually have to solve the stocks so all this money gets created then that creates demand now at the same time companies are buying back their own stock which is limiting supply so this pushes stock prices up and you have this ... this virtuous cycle\nAs people get more borrowing capacity to borrow more money they don't have anything else to do with the money 'cause nothing else was give them a decent rate of return so they keep buying more and more stocks\nBut what always happens in these cycles is it that when the fed stress raising interest rates than all of a sudden the margin that doesn't become as attractive as it used to be actually so I think today that if you're borrowing less than about fifty granted Schwab on margin right now it's costing you nine to ten percent\nOkay that's a big number and all of a sudden that isn't as attractive as stocks aren't going up so fast you combine that with again you know big change in the house in ... this fall and all of a sudden social mood starts changing\nPeople aren't as optimistic there's not as much confidence it's two years of what you've just been through on the cabinet hearings only is going to feature Mr Trump and everybody he knows\nNow again you may think that's what should happen and that's all fine you're into that opinion and I'm not here to argue it one way or the other but I'm going to tell you can have a tremendous impact on the stock market because all of this revolves around confidence and it will be crushing the confidence and the fact that may be a strategic move by the people on the other side\nBecause if the economy's not doing well it's going to be a whole lot harder for the Republicans to win and twenty twenty but that's kind of the big view on all of this\nThe smaller view is that you've got very little cash\nLeft on the sidelines it's getting more expensive for people to borrow money to buy stocks and when that happens people stop borrowing so much that takes away demand when you take away demand that when companies have to borrow at pay more to borrow money to buy back their own stock\nWhen mortgages go up and now housing prices have to come down to reflect the increase in mortgage rates all of a sudden the economy starts turning that turns very quickly and again in two thousand and eight when the market crashed it last forty percent of its value in a month\nIt was Thirteen Years of gains in Eighteen months\nThat is very likely in my opinion something on that magnitude is inevitable I can tell you when it's going to start but I can tell you you're seeing a lot of signs of the top right now now companies may continue to buy back their stock next year because they haven't spent all the repatriated money\nBut earnings are starting to get weaker this quarter GDP forecaster being lowered around the world\nYes you've gotten through the NAFTA deal but you still have a lot of issues with China Italy's a basket case and they're going to have big problems with the ... you and you may end up with another group wanting to Italy may want to leave the EU sometime this year\nAll of these things can take this market down very quickly and getting back to the first idea\nPeople always tell me that their investors and I would argue that they're not\nGetting their gamblers because they don't really understand what they own why they own a they just heard it was a good company or their study says it was a good company but they don't really have a plan of what happens when I'm wrong and we're going to always be wrong because these things all change\nYou know we think about ten years ago the greatest company out there to buy for the long term was was blackberries called ... back in the day\nHe was trained for a hundred and forty dollars a share it was the dominant cell phone company you can be president you didn't have a blackberry you couldn't be secretary of state unless you had Thirteen blackberries I mean just for convenience but be that as it may\nThe problem was is that apple came along with a new phone and an Android came along and all of a sudden this dominant company got crushed this long term can't lose proposition lost in that stock one from a hundred and forty bucks a share right now I think is trading around ten or eleven and it's not going to come back\nAnd this is the other thing and I'll go through this with you guys in class\nWhen stocks fall they almost never come back you know people talk about why by these you know good dividend paying stocks okay in a blue chips okay well Ford is is still down Seventy five percent gee is down eighty percent and it keeps tanking many of the large banks are still down eighty and Ninety percent and they're not going to come back\nThat's the side of this that people never see and that's what I Will show you in class and how show you how to make money on it as well\nSo again the classroom and to be teaching as before the crash will talk about strategies for the market going up market going down how do we actually profit on these moves down you can get to free tickets and a
