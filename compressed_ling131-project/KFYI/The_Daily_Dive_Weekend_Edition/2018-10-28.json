eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nThey'll let you participate in a couple of sessions so you can see exactly what it is we're talking about the Michael calls it a classroom the ultimate teacher or mentor is there like I say he's got a PHD and making money and he's going to teach you to do what he does every day\nStarts in the postal system so they're trying to like retroactively go back to see where it started and if there's any video of a person maybe dropping off or something\nIt's almost like they're trying to start from the end of the construction at the device then work their way back\nSo for now the package as either a rise are still being sent to Quantico the lab and Virginia and what they're going to try to do is traced this as it as that could include DNA or fibers found on the package as they are playing on the back of the\nStand or on the pay they'll begin this assembling these packages that\nTend to trace them back to their fender and so now they're going to train the whether it'd be kind of structure of these little pipe bomb whether they left them sort of\nThing that chart whether they let them sort of air any wiring and maybe that was sort of their traits that there are a lot of it that investigators now have to put together they just have a big puzzle I had at that\nAnd we learned a little bit more about the devices themselves they said they were made out of PVC pipe covered with black tape beach I like a small battery some wires maybe some broken glass for maximum damage but is there anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very new details about the ... the the fight that they're saying that these are capable of being lied explosive whether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X rays at the at the\nWas it an are examining nez and are going through the ants wiring and the battery aunts and overall material that age are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros the Clintons the Obamas CNN and John Brennan Eric Holder Debbie Wasserman Schultz as you've said is the return address for all of the ten devices\nRepresentative Maxine Waters Joe Biden Robert Deniro these are all high profile Democrats and critics of the president the administration how was the president been responding\nThat President has largely been hunting that blame offices and\nSelf in his rhetoric and back onto the media so although at least I get rain Trump rally from his normal show on Wednesday night it was absent from the lock her up chants while he was speaking or ... points back\nAt the end of the ... and criticizing the media and the crowd the wild it did however at that rally\nCall for the needy at night the country he also tweeted on a Thursday again blaming the media for that he said that have very big part of the angered at least in our society it caused by basically\nFake news and that it's gotten so bad that it beyond description of what we see here is something very standard of the president a dance day it said that he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that would be\nPretty careful that played impact and in the mid term that works you will and grace that the blame for that and putting it back to when it hits the at targets which is the media yeah\nIt's going to be interesting to see how it all shakes out the investigation is ongoing I Know details are going to be coming in and changing every day and the man hunt is on to see who or what group might have sent these out thank you very much Lauren Meyer reporter for access thanks for joining us thank you so much [laughter]\n[laughter]\nIt's election season and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this here for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not TV it's not these robo calls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate the rules on automated both taxing it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McKay but he's a tech reporter at ... for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so you said robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial ... more people because it's a machine during that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls ... these are actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line and they're becoming more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto film whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people convince thousands of them and our\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left in the riot problems like open sesame or hustle you know because that's me on the right hospital or to on the on the left to send these tax than it's essentially building a a platform to do that at scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we\nAll know that people can go and they can call and they have political candidates often a common space with other people of his supporters so it's not entirely on like that in terms of\nBeing another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rate of about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ... percent likely to actually open it and read some of it at least so the the engagement is there\nAnd open to me which is one of these providers to Ninety percent of tech method is I read within five minutes and I mean I think that is increasingly we know how impactful that could be given that we get\nSo much political email so much political mail in this election in every election now and there's so much messaging that any way to break through the voters is a big deal for him and\nThis is the daily died weekend edition we'll be right back with more about personalized political text messages and how to get them to stop it [noise]\nCurious about investing in Canada and\nLearn more about how to invest in the booming cannabis industry go watch\nThe Asian Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nRadical text messages [laughter]\nRight I mean we're glued to our phones and you tend to open a text message you hear that little paying you tend to open it right away almost as you said within five minutes a lot of times\nWe're kind of conditioned all ready to ignore a robocall or ignore a call that comes in from a suspicious number or an email you kind of already can see by the headline or something that it's spam or something like that but with these text messages you're really unclear about what it is so you have to open it\nBroadly speaking the tax message inbox is a lesson ad heavy spot for many people\nNot everybody but I think generally speaking we see that the messaging after made really popular with people and and they have not been monetize in the same way as opposed to Facebook or Twitter where people are now more used to ads in the feed and messaging will probably be ...\nYeah and since it's a a person to person thing I mean obviously they're kind of sending them and massing all but campaigns are hoping for that interaction maybe it is something you're interested in you text back and you say hey where is that rally going to be or what's going on then it opens that line of communication and the campaign can interact directly with those voters\nAnd now obviously the huge benefit for voter contact another reason that he said that they like this technology\nObviously a lot of people are angry though for myself I feel like I Can't trust my phone anymore you\nKnow if a suspicious phone calls coming in I don't know if I should answer it or not now with the ... you know emails the same way now it's text messages I saw a lot of voters are angry about this because they feel like they didn't sign up for these things how are these campaigns getting your phone numbers and then you know I I Know that there's been a few complaints and lawsuits filed already of\nCampaigns are are getting this from voter records or from the firms that binds motorcade\nI mean there's a longstanding pretty significant market for a voter data that feeds into all of that the digital advertising that we see and\nAnd so a lot of records are there and there's also a public information you're right that some consumers have not been super happy with this they filed a complaint with the Federal Communications commission says I Know there's some effort to get some clarity about what these messages are subject to restrict wise and whatnot at the FCC they haven't ruled on that yet\nOne of the ways they get your phone numbers and this was I mean to be one of the most creative ways I guess there was a liberal billionaires name was Tom Steyer and he had a political action group they submitted a freedom of Information Act request to public colleges asking for their student directory and\nOf social interaction if we are letting our computers make those decisions for us but I also have just a logistical and practical question about how something like that would work I mean if my phone agrees to a dinner date for me\nHow do I make sure I Know that I have agreed to that and what if my friend so to enter and I'm not there and they're pissed off at me right and I the one to blame or is my phone to blame it ... it sounds like a nightmare\nYeah or you're just talking to a friend in person and then you double book herself because your phone did it for you I mean you know this is like you say we are talking about black marry him so but this leads us further beyond that into the movie with Joaquin Phoenix and her and then all these am I going to be talking to each other and then leave everybody at the end of it you know\nI mean I just love all of this future talk but it's not so far off anymore these things are advancing so fast\nYou mentioned the law passed in California that they have to disclose their chat box\nBecause things are moving so fast and all the regulatory stuff is always so far behind\nSome people are very against this chat bought disclosure law because they think that it might quiet or Stein the innovation in the ... market which actually you know these kinds of automated tech services have a real utility and so there's a lack\nOf regulation and then there may also be knee jerk need to regulate out of fear is a very uncharted territory I Would say um but we are all ready in it you know it's serious it's also you know we've been talking about the funny or unexpected are weird ways in which these box will affect society but\nAlso bad actors can take advantage of these thoughts and turn them into spam machines or other and the various uses and\nAt the moment we are at the mercy\nOf the tech companies to try to design these product in such a way as to minimize their potential for abuse but we just are basically crossing our fingers at that\nAnd the trust is not always there so in the meantime the where the robots Emily dry right senior writer for wired thank you very much for joining us thank

up to two years ... technology [laughter]\nFor the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the Central American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras there's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border\nTo help stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops of the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant care of and we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked talked on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last time there was a caravan back in April I mean I think the one difference we have here is we're now at the doorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue\nFor him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats stand for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe's saying that these countries you know Honduras El Salvador Guatemala they're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there are so you know some military guys they put up a roadblock ate at one point but then they tore down right away\nI guess maybe there was too many people are they knew they weren't gonna be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just not enough and like I said now he wants to start cutting eight I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid has been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was\nSomewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and then in twenty Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate to bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and and and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere and four hundred million so even before all this happened President Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries so that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't have an hour to do that on his own right these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give in Central American aid when the time comes\nAnd the president being very forceful on this stuff does give some political cover to Republicans who have to push this through because the Democrats are going to be on the opposite side of it with regards to the terms you know he's saying\nWhenever you see these people come across in these criminals and unknown middle Easterners and everything to keep the Democrats in mind we have to change our crappy immigration laws so he makes it about the midterms and everything and he provides a little covered by being forceful but\nIs there not much political will on the part of Congress to do something I I'm there was some immigration bills that tried to pass this past year and none of them went through even some of the ones that the White House was backing\nI mean I think you really need to consider his words in the context of where we are right now and only being two weeks away from the mid term and I think this is an issue that is really important to Republican voters in it\nSeems like it's going up an interest in recent weeks and less so for Democrats essentially as a way for them to mobilize their base to get them out to the polls now whether\nAny of these proposals you know border wall slashing funding to Central America rewriting asylum laws I mean these are all really big projects and even maybe a year ago a little less than a year ago when Congress was working in a bipartisan fashion to address them\nThey really struggled to do so and they weren't able to advance any legislation and the White House suppose the bills that had the most support so it's hard to imagine that after the midterms with Democrats likely to take back some ground in the house is not when it entirely that they'd come back to the table and work out a better deal\nWhat has been the reaction from the leaders of these countries Honduras Guatemala El Salvador I Know the Mexican the incoming Mexican president has suggested that\nThe U.S Canada and Mexico work out some funding development for poor areas of Central America in southern Mexico where are these companies trying to do to reduce this type of migration\nThe president says the the northern triangle countries were up in Washington DC not too long ago for a summit was convened by the U.S and Mexico jointly to talk about these very issues\nAnd you know for the most part they're open to cooperating on security issues but there are clearly limitations in it in some cases those are economic limitations and not having the funding to do it and that's I mentioned before with us funding is being caught towards these kind of projects in Central America right now and then in other cases it's political and it's because of\nPolitical instability in their home country I mean I'm Doris in particular is an example where I'm the president there Juan Orlando Hernandez is a strong us ally but one\nNarrow reelection and doesn't really have much of a mandate to govern you definitely\nHave different situations in each country in different capacities as to how they're able to address this\nTen has an immigration reporter for Politico thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having\n\nAn interesting story that came across our radar this week was about youth hostels expanding in the United states\nBut they're shutting their old identities they don't want to be called hospitals anymore it's a shift in the fast growing hotel industry that's making its way away from its barebones passive traditional hospitals are adding more private rooms some with established hotel brands are shrinking room sizes\nThey're putting more focused on bars and food to target millennials and betting that young travelers are going to pay a higher price for the bar in food offerings well paying lower prices for the bad so I brought in my producer Miranda to talk about the one of the leaders in these hotel hustle hybrids\nThere's this lemon based hospitality group called generator and they just opened their first us property in Miami Beach last month this is the first time that this company has made their dorm room like accommodation outside Europe for that first time ever and they kinda get irritated if you'd call them yeah\nHostels 'cause they said that the hostile thing doesn't describe them that way\nThat they're Miami property has more private rooms than the dorm room setting like bunk beds you were describing\nYeah they want to be placed in this space between a hostile and a cool boutique hotel\nYeah and they do look like a call ... help you go on their website that really look beautiful and I was looking at some of the options 'cause I was like OK let's pretend we're going to go to Miami I Want the premium room it's a little bit bigger it's got a giant king sized bed at least one to two people\nAnd it's only a hundred and twenty five dollars a night to state two minute walk on ready to Miami or are you getting\nThis song geared towards the younger travelers and it's big business the world tourism organization said that travelers age Fifteen to twenty nine accounted for an estimated twenty three percent of all international travellers and twenty Fifteen so nearly a quarter of travelers\nPutting together a tray planet and reviewing your trade plant and reviewing your trades against your trade plan\nWho could help motivate you who can keep you on the right track who can keep moving forward we have a tremendous amount of resources available for that\nBecause it's the key to the whole thing you can't learn how to do this out of a book you can't learn this from CDs could you learn magical indicators sure\nBut then I'm going to ask you how do you know which is a hundred and fifty indicators to use on any given trade how do you know which of the infinite available parameters you should use and this given trade\nAnd the short answer is you don't\nThe indicators work until they don't and the reality is that these things generally are have about fifty percent or less probability rating so how is that going to be the foundation\nOf a successful set of strategies especially when most of them have terrible if any risk management which again from a knowledge perspective is key we can help motivate you we can keep you on the right path\nAnd that is critically important when I started learning to trade I went through a lot of hotel seminars and sometimes the information was okay a lot of times it was junk a lot of times it's hard to tell the difference but\nWhen you left there then you look at something and say but it's this one of these were this one of those and there wasn't anyone to ask again we have an entire part of our staff that all they do is work with students they have no sales responsibilities they have no no quotas targets anything else\nThey are they're simply to ensure your success\nAnd if you go back to why do we have five stars out of five stars of the better Business Bureau why do we have four point nine out of five stars on Google Plus\nWhy do we have out of the you know all of our students when do surveys why is it that Ninety seven point seven two percent of Phoenix students rate at their experience with us either four or five stars\nAgain we don't pay for reviews we don't have a bad reputation management firm we don't give people discounts when they write nice things about us\nWhat we do is we do what we say we're going to do one of things I always say to people is\nBecause we are local because we have a campus in Scottsdale you know where to find us we're accountable to you in a way that nobody else is if we say we're going to do something we're going to do it I grew up in a world that if you told someone you are going to do something and you didn't do it\nThey would show up at your house and beat you until you get that was the world I grow up\nAnd if you don't come and physically beat us again I expect you to say nasty things about us on line\nAnd the reason that we don't have that is because we do do what we say we're going to do now we also are very direct with you you got to do your part okay if you don't follow through if you're not disciplined if you're not motivated if you can't\nFocus and and and put together a trade plant began with our help will give you a tremendous help in that and you're with all due respect you are going to need that help because there's a lot more to those trade plans on what people realize but you've got to get out from you know in front of the TV and sit down and do this and part of this becomes\nJust first understanding are you serious about achieving your financial goals what are they\nMost people's financial goals consistent roughly of I Want to be comfortable in retirement I wouldn't be financially secure well what does that mean if you don't put a number to that how do you know if you're on track for it\nAnd so we work with you on ideas like that as well and and it all comes down to how serious argue about achieving your financial goals\nAnd the sad fact is the vast majority of people aren't serious it all\nThe reason that most people don't achieve their financial goals is it never really set them\nAnd then they never actually do what's required to meet them and the you know as thorough said most men lead lives of quiet desperation\nSome point in their lives people just kind of get focused on making it to the finish line and they're trying to survive and and exist instead of to live and the markets are a great opportunity to achieve financial goals to actually live but they're not the only alternative you may decide on\nThe left lane members three lanes Hannah Holmes buff\nBarreling down the hill and he hit by right\nFront right by them\nI'm getting tired yeah that's good you got hit my heart's boss that's the you know some deep pockets there\nUh well I I was from entering his brain\nOkay then uh hopefully you have deep pockets so what is your question\nWell ah the the fact of the damage to the bus I think it was like three hundred and Seventy eight bucks and the ah the guy got along or I guess he's claiming\nOh yeah ... that's crap just turn it over your insurance company\nJust turn I did I did\nAnd then there are so there is nothing more to say you give them a statement you say that's bowl a while you can't say that's bull 'cause you have no idea if he was in fact a danger or not you're not a doctor I so what's your question\nUh well I mean I I've got fifty hunger defined I yeah I it's not going to go down um ...\nNo it's not going to go for more than two thousand dollars what do you think he's going to get\nFor a in a in a car accident\nIn which a bus has three hundred and fifty dollars worth of injury or based on the based on a collision with a car oh please don't just turn over your insurance companies are going to offer the guy nothing\nI wouldn't worry about it okay All right there you go a Alex Alex [noise] old mill yes\nI'm a truck driver California local driver and I just had a quick question or I was doing the delivery at this place that I go to regularly and I use the restroom there plenty of times before this one particular day they told me that uh the policy change and drivers weren't allowed to use the restroom\nSo I asked him to work and I go to guy Floyd felt that it does go find a port a potty that we have a ... for the drivers so I walked around the facility didn't see a port a potty came back to them uh told him they look role you said there was a port a potty there is nothing can I usually go to the restroom now\nHe's like telling me now because you can't use the restroom so I told them you know it shouldn't be against the wall for you to operate a business\nAnd conduct business and not have restrooms so I don't know where I stand on\nDoes that well first of all a and I don't think there is a law but even if there is a law I it he can say to the public or you can say non employees you can't use our bathroom there's no ... absolutely you can do that\nFound it absolutely nothing other than nothing a driver can do now how big a facility is is that you're delivering to\nIt's a pretty substantial\nSo why would why wouldn't you call the ah the supervisor or the president of the company and go are you serious or your boss and go are you guys serious we can't use a bathroom there\n[laughter] yeah my mom's ... that they were they were pretty ah they were pretty creepy oh than ah than you know but this is stuff that we run into\nA ... so this happened ones to you this that the one story\nAnd then you now you're able to use the restroom at your heart's content right\nNo not not their night they still won't let you use the bathroom there nobody uses the rest of your only employees I mean they can do that I Know and they have no quarter but yeah well they\nCan do that they can do that so you know what you do you bring a bottle\nYeah yeah yeah I mean literally you but they they have the right to do that I'm just surprised I'm surprised that management doesn't allow drivers to use the facilities I'm surprised that your lawsuit could away from ... on ... on their management yeah OK but I'm surprised I'm surprised your boss doesn't call 'em up and go come on\nReally are you really doing it and so I don't I've never heard of that\nUh I never have a saying you can't use the bathroom I mean it happens all the time of restaurants you see that especially in sketchy areas where you see a restaurant for customers only\nAnd I've actually gone and it was I remember in a New Orleans I went into right into
