no way to beat the system right\nUm is gonna be a cap for that but I Know that matters a lot because of the couch for ... storms because most of the day with\nBoth foreign and with the current storm you had both storms go through periods of rapid intensification that mean that it intensified by about thirty five miles an hour or ... or in twenty four hours this far exceeded\nThat baseline definition of what we think we may\nAnd I say we meaning the climate community and as somebody who covers the community I Am I'm a way but really\nIt's the scientists who are doing the work and they're saying to me we think we might be seeing a trend towards more frequent rather than an occasion that the real forecast challenge because of it will be happening more frequently you could go to sleep\nThinking you're going to get hit by ethically one and wake up\nThe hit by a category for a real nightmare with this storm\nAndrew Freedman science editor for Axios extreme weather expert thank you for joining us they can ... [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOne of the other huge stories of the week was just this surreal moment in the Trump Administration when rapper Kanye West went to the oval office he had a meeting with the president\nAnd in true ... fashion he just had this stream of consciousness rent it provided a lot of laughs a lot of question marks nobody knew what he was going for sometimes Miranda you're a big fan of ... yes what did you think of it\nI have not yet and brought myself to watch the full video ready because I still want to continue being a fan of panic [laughter] he's made it very challenging because I don't often agree with President Trump he talked about the hat and\nHow was the Superman Cape for him we actually have a little portion of that let's play ... at the oval office uh\nI think it's this waiver that helps you to day life you know they try to scare me to not where this had my own friends but this has it gives me it gives me the power in a way it was something about one of\nOff it made me feel like Superman who made from al ... and you may or may take for me also got a ... you look around to American guy no political\nGoal was to be on it how we want to do it by saying this is all a goal has done\nThe president just smiling politely at the end you say hey you know what that was very impressive and you know ... ... feels like a President Trump is a kindred spirit to him almost he\nFeels like he's the same type of guy who's criticized a lot but\nCapable of doing great things we spoke to Olivia new species a Washington correspondent for New York magazine she was in the oval office when ... was there with the president said we spoke to her about her impressions of that\nAnd then she was also part of a bigger story that happened early in the week she had a private press conference with the president\nMike Pence Mike Pompeo chief of staff John Kelly and that also was another surreal moment it was the closest thing you'd ever get to being a fly on the wall so when we come back from the break we'll get into that full interview with Olivia new to this is a daily dive weekend edition [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] are you ready to get in get out and get paid flipping houses in the Phoenix area if so he was an amazing opportunity for you the ...\nStory and asking why he was there in the first place\n[laughter] little\nOstensibly you've been there to talk about criminal justice reform remember his life Kamkar dashing less influence the president back in your early cheering to commute the sentence for a woman who had been in prison since like Nineteen Ninety six on a drug charge\nAnd the president did that and I uh he got a lot of positive press for that and that\nKind of one of these rare non controversial good things that he did and I think that he is acceptable to ... and ... and that's probably cynically part of why he want to continue killing this sort of thing and his son in law Jared Kushner who's the top White House advisor that's made criminal justice reform wanted his\nCentral issues and so\nIt gets reported earlier this week that ... that should be coming in to speak to the president and that was like main topics that they were supposed to be covering but of course ... has been out there very controversial a very openly supporting Donald Trump over the last month and booth recently on ask now wearing a make America great again hat\nWearing it everywhere and he was wearing it today and it it's really funny in the oval office I just kept thinking this is so unusual because\nA Donald Trump is not the most puzzling figure sitting here in the oval office today and he went out the most talkative person in the oval office\nIf it's sort of a monologue from Kanye West he was also not the one burying the make America great again hat so it's very weird\nIt was so interesting watching the video because the president sitting behind a desk and he has his hands class and he's just looking at ... go off and it was just like quietly nodding his head like you said\nShe wasn't really strange ... outlandish character in their ... just went off and it was very much like the ... of passwords stream of consciousness and he's just going on and and he sort\nOf out Trump yeah Trump and the president speaks that way too though where he speaks in the stream of consciousness he touches on all different topics I mean I had a you mentioned before first hand experience it said earlier this\nBig of a lot of it but I had a better view of the president wherever standing in the oval and I get a ... but I could see them both and it was just so interesting to watch\nHow the president was just completely dazzled and confused\nAt that time but what is happening silent I mean he did yeah almost never silent\nHe'd chime I only a couple of times you know it was about ten minutes\nAnd he spoke initially when I first walked in he was speaking he was saying that the act NFL player who was there along the ... when it's actually a better lacrosse player and I don't know anything about sports I don't have any idea that true or not and then he started talking about what\nHe considers accomplishments and he talked about North Korea and I I wrote it down because it's so funny but\nWhen the president spoke about North Korea Kanye West responded he said quote I like the north Korea\n[laughter] I'm like okay I don't know I\nKnow I think maybe he meant like he like policy on North Korea\nBut it is funny but then yeah and that's all Kanye\nAnd as you mentioned you know he was warning that a make America great again hat you know he mentioned that specifically he said that Donald Trump gave him the power you know he made them feel like Superman it was that Superman Cape but he had he talked about that he talked about his own mental health saying\nI'm not bipolar I got another doctor to see me or something even brought out his phone we know we just pass code now zero zero zero zero\nAnd he said you know can we get rid of the air force one we want to do this I clean one\nYou know I think some people say oh if the president bleeding and the mentally ill person after after calling a bloody bad about himself in the oval office than I think that's just\nSort of bullshit mentally ill people people who have mental illness that it doesn't mean that they're not\nAutonomous human beings and that they can't make their own version than that they should be baby fat or are treated as though they're not intelligent you know I think they're just can put stick productive way to talk about mental illness and I saw that narrative taking off a little bit after that meeting and I found it really troubling\nTotally disagree with that also I mean as crazy as ... can be at times he is a very smart man he knows what he's doing in a sense he's very conscious of himself and his kind of role in popular culture I don't think he's being taken advantage of in the slightest\nWe are making that kind of attack it probably is such a gift and if they think it's irresponsible to take chicken ... I guess about what his true state of light in and I I just wanted to make sure we were talking about that\nI just thought it would almost be a misrepresentation\nTo try to Cancun and he had his clothes and make them easier to digest are more focused because that's just how he talks he did not speak in a clear and concise way and I think ... if he is ever taken out of context and I don't mean that at\nLike an insult your reporter is the way that\nPeople say taking a contract that anytime the quotes are chopped up so that they can be clearer I think it kind of an accurate in a way and I thought it was very interesting I was on CNN last night and a Republican operative who was on with me on the air she said that she had a fit at dinner earlier that night and\nSomebody who was in my piece that she wouldn't say who but it's a small group of people she bumped into him at dinner\nAnd he said that the White House with\nReally clean that might be and they really liked it and they thought it was very fair and quote the opposite of fake news\nYou know and I tried to do their thing\nBecause it it's not the night that he in the world but I think that\nTrump is probably satisfied\nTo see his quotations printed in full I think he would the times that he feel depressed as being unfair is probably a lot of the time when it's cold it's chopped up and ... people tried to ... what he's saying rather than just\nPutting it out there and so I'm sure people are going to give me some shit about printing a full transcript basically of what he said but I think that's\nJust the only way to really understand what he was saying\nI agree with you completely the article is great it's the closest thing to being a fly on the wall in the room thing to to just kind of see what's going on you know and\nAnd as you say it's time to ... might have seen like a production or whatever but you know that's the way it seems like it goes in there and I love the way you wrote it out ... ... as it happened chronologically as you said\nThe times the interrupted you it was just amazing so I have a great job on that piece and you know it's just great but you were able to be there for these two big moments or just this week uh Olivia knew the Washington correspondent for New York magazine thank you very much for joining us\nThank you so much [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nAnd don't forget to join us on social media really dive pod on Twitter ... or something [noise] leave a comment it was raining and tells the story that your interest [noise]\nAll of a sudden I heard radio and wherever you get your podcasts by moslem heirs and do some of the daily died\nMy\nThat'll go by the way out of my job I was taking all of that\nI'm On the groomers and we're running down some of the top stories of the week just to check out the daily died Monday through friday to more news without the noise [laughter]\nOf the most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian cosmonauts\nThat had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station and two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use rockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old\nUh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space X and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubles Russian space program\nIs the only link that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rod pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story this was a white as you said a woman astronaut\nWhen you assess not one cause not go up the space station there in the Soyuz spacecraft which also rides up on a rocket at the same name that was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station gr we're gonna come back\nNow the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that's their get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency but the official seal of approval on that for coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew or not turning it didn't\nSo early what happened is that it made it through about two minutes of flight staging first said second stage and what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally have drugs they drink but it's been a long time since I've looked at that tells me there might have been something going on with what are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened to the staging either the engine built to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the\nFirst stage to drop pre properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort\nThe rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age book on our side and the ... the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have it aboard option until much later than when you abort your ground control punches a big red button and a capsule let's go from the top of the rocket inspires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely\nPowerful and just burn for a few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the aboard but it's like getting slammed up a block of concrete right because\nAn historically what always happens in these cycles as the fed starts raising interest rates people start backing off on their borrowing okay it affects mortgage mortgage rates go up and mortgage rates have gone from about three percent to five percent and the last year or two K. that's a huge increase\nWhen that happens housing prices have to come down because people can only afford so much house now can we lowered the standards sure we can do that for a while but eventually that catches up with us secondly what you see historical years when money starts getting more expensive people start backing off on the margin debt\nThat takes away demand for stocks because it's taking money that was borrowed that was being used to buy stocks it's pulling that money out\nWhen you reduce demand then what happens to price will price falls and so what you tend to see historical years before price falls you'll see a fallen margin debt now we haven't seen the on march in debt occurring yet but interest rates are just starting to move up\nThe last year the U.S treasury tenure rate has moved up about a third okay it's about one percent higher than it was about a year ago\nJust that's that's a big number okay even just you think about the government debt okay we were at two years ago we were running a deficit of about six hundred billion dollars a year now again that's a ridiculous numbers actually more than five trillion a year because of how we do the math but that's another show\nBut okay it was about six hundred billion officially this year it's about nine hundred and fifty seven billion that's a fifty percent plus increase in two years\nAnd then here's the killer it's not the fed raising rates a quarter of a percent a year it's the fact that the Federal Reserve isn't buying as many bonds as they used to what's happening is is what they did\nThat until two thousand and Thirteen they just kept buying new bonds and they bought about three and a half trillion dollars worth of bonds well starting in two thousand and Thirteen and they stopped buying new ones but they rolled over all the ones they always had\nSo in a bind came do they would just buy it from the government again and that kept the government's financing costs down well last October they started what was called the rolling off the balance sheet so they stopped buying so many bonds and for the first three months of this they didn't buy ten billion dollars worth of bonds\nThat essentially came off their balance sheet as they matured\nWell this October this month that number goes to fifty billion so for the next say year and change okay you're going to have about seven hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of bonds that the fed owns that they're not going to re by\nIf you've had your increase in your debt go your deficit by fifty percent three hundred and some billion and now you have another what's to say for a year you've got six hundred billion in bonds that the fed currently owns that they're not really buying\nThat is a trillion dollars worth of bonds that you have to find a buyer for and if you haven't noticed we're not everybody's best friend in this world it's China is not going to step in and help us with that Russia is not going to step in and help us with that and by the way everybody else's broke anyway\nSo who's going to buy all those bonds to yield two and a half percent\nWell the short answer is no one so if you now have this huge supply of bond you have to sell and there's not a big increase in demand what happened is the price of oil price has to go down which means that yields go up\nSo now all of a sudden it's more expensive for companies to borrow money so they can't buy back as much Stockton there have been the biggest buyers of stocks out there\nIs more expensive for people to buy stock on march in housing prices fall\nThe government budget gets even more out of whack which means you're even farther behind on the debt side which means you're gonna have to issue more bonds and that's all of this is going from a virtuous cycle where the low rates made mortgages cheaper made stocks cheaper made the government budget affordable\nTo where now it's unwinding is turning the other direction\nHow long will it take to play out I don't have a clue and neither does anybody else but this\nHaving to sell the new bonds is going to be a as Joe Biden would put it this is a big deal okay so we want to make sure that we're prepared so again the class I'm teaching is before the crash profit and protection strategies for any market\nThis is not a gloom and doom presentation this is the facts this is where we are in this market here where the valuations are\nThe market may still go higher that's always possible we can still make money with these strategies in that market but by the way there's also a lot of things besides stocks out\nThere we can put our money into and a lot of that stuff isn't sitting at all time highs and ridiculous valuations so we'll talk about how to do some of those things and the key thing we focus on is if you look at a chart and you know what you're looking at you can have a pretty good idea where the people that have the money to move\nThis market are buying and where they're selling and all we're trying to do is learn to do that\nSo we can buy when they buy and sell when they sell and also understand that we're going to be wrong sometimes\nAnd I'll be obviously a having a U.S or we're and I I Would think\nAll right ah it's a phone calls for sure Oh Mary we'll start with you Hi Mary welcome to handle on law\nOh yes I Am I I don't know if you like going into a matchmaker watching the one year old lawyer taken out with you and I have a lot of I think you could call it that the whole only ... oh no you\nGo into a lot of people know who Don Quixote is a lot of people that uh that was the guy used to train horses in Finland I think and was one of the great horsemen of all of Finland do I have that right\nI'm like oh OK almost I almost their quota All right but I I Know like it's hard to get it\nLawyer because I have four hundred Lauer okay by moving ... who that clicking on the crap out\nSo you want a lawyer that will take equity in a house the practices elder abuse ...\nAnd we had a phone and we had a phone call a ... that there was a sixty one year old man that had just passed the bar and was looking for cases and so you're trying to connect a sixty one year old with taking elder abuse case\n... no game um who will take and I assume on contingency or take a a lien against a household and lie about an hour\nA hundred hundred an hour now does it matter as a matter that a lawyer has absolutely no experience and doesn't even know how to spell elder law\nI don't you don't care for the lawyer has knowing Marion son\nAt the bar I'll do our work\nWhat do you mean you'll do all the work you're going to do all these ...\nLegal you know I Love to do it by ...\nDidn't want to do that then ... even if it is this for you of course\nThen why don't view then where does that then why don't you represent yourself\nBecause ... kind of like why they say only a fool represent looked out\nWell let me ah sixty one year old lawyer who has never written a document regarding elder abuse in his life uh that's probably a less competent than you are my dear\nBut he had a choir behind the room\nSo why you can represent yourself I I live so why do you think\nSomeone who has Esquire behind their name is going to somehow when the case and by the way it was a case\nDismissed about what was the case dismissed\nNo I think American guy they're going for a dollar an hour\nTo ... how did you lose Mary how to how we thank you wash the case how does what does that mean recording now\nSo you haven't lost\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... anyone in the area quite I think it's a federal court now like those people caught a lot of\nLow I see so you lost the case and now you're appealing the case\n... well appeal\nBy the way you'll never find in a good appeals lawyer they will charge four hundred dollars now are those guys are six seven hundred dollars an hour for a company and you know because they're\nAll right well you you have the word out ... ah well you can leave your name and number and if Mr sixty one year old lawyer who's never done a case in his life ever who just passed the bar and you think is going to file an appeal now I have been a lawyer for over Thirty years you know that Mary\nWell why don't you represent\nA problem is I Would never I don't have the skills that to ride an appeal I Would never dream of writing an appeal I just don't have that skill set that's right I Want it so but you want someone with no skills said just because they are best square behind their name\nWell it's better than the lunar well no it's not better than you alone I'm telling you you are more invested in this you have more experience in this then that lawyer does oh you want to press just because someone has Esquire behind their name\nThat means not saying well\nMaybe mean something but uh not a whole lot so anyway it's fascinating how people are impressed with lawyers ah ... never get\nThat All right I every\nThere you go higher ivory welcome to handle on law we're going to do for you\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm I took out a ... year warranty contract with the term my company and [noise] and and that was in two thousand six to ... thousand Seventeen I started noticing that my would wish tripping on the corner of my house\nYeah and I don't know what they were turned my findings I called the representative that initially treated my own histone ... for a couple of months I finally called the the main\nOffice and explain to them what was happening and that my front porch where to lose in my own [noise] they sent their representative out\nExterminated again and then another aspects and told me that I now have\nSubterranean termites so he says you can get an extended on the mind you I was still under the contract of the ... but yet seen what what's going on underneath my house and he had written which I didn't notice what repair excluded\nOr what do you mean in a way where you didn't notice say so you didn't read the document\nUm we were talking yeah don't matter but you didn't read the document no I didn't know okay oh I didn't know\nAll right so you now subterranean a termites I guess that were treated eyes so they did treat but it said would repair excluded and okay was\nSo at this point I accepted it another indication from another company to come into an expectation that was in\nJuly now mine chew marches when both termites were treated again the other company findings where I had major infestation of both I contacted the state of California pest control\nAnd they had no record whatsoever that this company had ever been to my own tree so they told me\nWhy would they why would they have a record of it because I might as well ...\nWhy would the state of California keep her record of maternal my company going to your house\nBecause by law they're supposed to submit a W T o form notify them\nReally okay I didn't know that so they have to be All right so I have to do it within ten days wow I didn't know that okay so every time they treat the apple at the state no we just treated a home hears the address right right right okay new study have\nThough they told me there in violation then that's an internal thing so I ended up filing a complaint with the state of California in the meantime the owner of the company wanted to give me seven hundred and fifty\nLet me you know I was going on forever okay this was taking way too long so the bottom line is there in violation\nInternally or you can sue them for all the damage or based on the damage subsequent to\nThey're coming in and treating and then you can argue that they had not had they had they treated correctly all the additional damage wouldn't have been done I don't think they can defend even based on the fact that they were violation of the law that's probably the violation of that\nUh that ordinance for that statute it would be ... ...\n... you got a small claims to that's it and now when you say you bought an additional warranty was that from the tour my company or or a third provider no from the same\nTurtle okay you're you're you're pretty good shape a you have to go and you have to go out get another term my company to screen all of that out including the term I damage treat everything and just to I'm a small claims court\nOkay now my question is I Would like to know what type of attorney do\nI Walk my court you know you do it in small claims court\nYou don't need an attorney [noise] oh okay I won't go damages will not be more than ten thousand dollars [noise] okay All right\nAnd uh and make sure you tell that complicated story to the small claims judges probably gonna ... book at you because they want it all done and thirty seconds if it's possible they have a they or\n[noise] what [noise] they have less patience that
