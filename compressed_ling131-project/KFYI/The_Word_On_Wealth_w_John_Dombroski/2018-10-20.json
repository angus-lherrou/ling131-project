for those out there who are either retired or approaching retirement you\nKnow weeks like last week and this week\nSeemed to ah create a little bit of anxiety for people who are close as I said to retirement or maybe you're already in retirement and that probably is something that's good if if that gets you to really think about things and and how your money's allocated where it's invest it\nAnd what these types of uh swings of and volatility means to you especially if you're living off of your retirement money or your your savings or investments and you're trying to create some type of an income from it\nAre these types of swings can sometimes really upset you and there's no question about that so\nI'm now that we've seen a little bit of stability per se coming back to the market is that going to last what we do know\nA but one thing we do know is is that at some point in your life you're going to have\nA assets leftover once you're a passed on and what have you done to put something in place in order to transition those assets to your loved ones\nWhether it's a will for a living trust or beneficiary designations that you have on your accounts what have you done and and and is it the way you want to have you reviewed that lately what got estate planning attorney Jonathan months with us\nFor this segment and we want to talk a little bit all about those things but also we had a recent passing of a\nOf an icon Jonathan this past week how are you\nI'm All right how are you John I'm doing great you know that's actually really sad it's it's funny we don't really because he he was quiet and you didn't really know anything about him but but Bill Gates said of his guests dearest longest best friend that\nThat without Paul Allen we don't have the personal computer right now I Know people might argue well we had apple and we have Steve Jobs but in reality what we know of as the personal computer running Microsoft writes the yeah the one that one that actually paved the way for Apple to sell so many ... because if people were going to like\nWithout the competition between Microsoft and apple we'd probably are where we are now like that really drove drove acknowledging and innovation ages and making them smaller amount for double such such now that\nMost kids in school have a laptop they work on or or\nTheir their portable device the cell phone which does more than any PC ever did ... years back so\nBill Gates credits Paul Allen as the he's like the father of the of what we know as the personal computer right right because of the that operating system and because of their strategic relationship they had with IBM ... at the time which they just fell into 'em because of Bill Gates vision but that Paul Allen was that the architect\nAnd you know that because of Paul Allen and I I I don't know if they ever had a robbery would be Steve Wozniak of apple right Steve Jobs always president might have to walk like Steve Wozniak was the one who actually like he had the technical savvy in the know how to actually you know do it which that was Paul Allen's gift with Microsoft\nBut but I think we just think of Paul Allen and Microsoft we don't really realize that Paul Allen was many other things and Paul Allen was like modern day renaissance man ... what\nIs it with these uh these individuals from a I guess the technology industry er and sports teams what's that all about I don't know but\nThey will I Will just say that that that what Paul Allen singlehandedly did for the Seattle Seahawks among he's single handedly responsible for raising those those twelve twelve man the twelfth man banners right right and honoring the fans there in Seattle because that they have such a strong fan base and football team and he said that football team has the old owner wanted to move them to Los Angeles\nThey talked about possibly the Seahawks may have to be sold in the wake of ... well the\nQuestion is whether Paul Allen sister um will will decide to run the team and do they know everyone know she's a fan I don't know\nThat the speculation is that she may not want to have anything to do it with with running a football team but it's really beyond that I mean Paul Allen leaves a legacy like he leaves the Howard Hughes asked legacy and that there are all these other companies that have his name on it that you don't even know about that that he was the da da da and behind the scenes that actually push these companies in the direction from\nAn investment firm that that helped you know technology startups another life changing uh companies get you know get off the ground and provide us with these great crazy products that was his company called Vulcan to his um his his ventures into aerospace and is creating this plane that was going to I'm\nWas going to be able to launch the rockets into the atmosphere for like space travel he was he was not in that competition as well you never heard about those ...\nAnd ... and his from what they say he had an incredible real estate portfolio yeah\nSo he was a very well a rounded or not only um [noise] business owner by owning these sports teams and bringing them back to a point of a a really success but then also his other businesses that he has he's he's leaving behind billions and billions of dollars Jonathan from\nWhat I've heard in of course we don't have all of
