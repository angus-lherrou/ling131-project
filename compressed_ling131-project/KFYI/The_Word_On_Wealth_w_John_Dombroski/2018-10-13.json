I got that from California and it keeps\n'em it keeps blooming to where you know I for like ... but nothing left because of how dry here and I was wondering how I can I have a greenhouse that I'm\nBuilding in the back I'm but I'm just trying to figure out what it is I Do hope is this the trees because it is a tropical fruit tree and and then my last question and I can get I grow Bloomberg vein here\nWell ... you're you're trying to get your pushing them though you know levels above gardening here in the valley turmoil has it been grown here quite a bit fairly successful your biggest problem is watching the cold weather in the winter the get go treat really does better in a cooler climate so it would do much better if you had a friend of Prescott valley\nOr higher elevation you know here are the summers were just awfully hot for getting up so that you will grow here we've grown up in the nursery before\nThey're going to be very slow and probably more useful as a patio plant anything else you're ... outdoors in the eastern exposure you're going to want to have been the soil so it's a little more acidic so that would be adding like coffee grounds are some soil so for a little chips and those kinds of things\nAnd then I'd be willing to protected in the wintertime the frost but you know there's a lot of easy things to grow here there's a lot of tropical things that are fun to grow here the last couple of years we've had no frost so there's ... pie is around that or you know eight foot tall with big fruit hanging on them without any protection that's not the norm\nAnd I'm afraid I'm afraid Allison that this winter because we did get the one storm come through from the north are ready if we start that type of a pattern which is more normal\nOr it's going to be very difficult for your chair more or less you protect\nOkay oh wow okay and then my last question also I have a friend\nWho lives with me now and he is eighty six years old and he has an apricots tree that eight years old and a peach tree to peach tree and he wants to move on to my property\nHow difficult would it be to pick those up\nNot terribly difficult to best time to move them a transplant them would be in a December January late December January when they're dormant okay you want to reduce their size by at least a third or more and you're going to have to get on it and Africa country that's how big in diameter of the trunk\n[noise] the trunk I Would say [noise]\nWhen I take my hand when I take my put it together how would I\nLike a basketball bad guys like ... a little a little bigger than that\nOkay who it's going to be difficult and heavy to move\nAnd you know really with the stone fruits they tend to grow pretty fast now if you have ... very well her in the valley but um you know it can be moved you're going to have to try and get a ... century that size though at least to you know say twenty four to thirty inches in diameter and about as as deep\nAnd you know if that large you cut the tree back to where it's just the trunk she cut it back to where it's about eight feet tall reshaping re grow it\nOh okay okay okay I appreciate\nYour ...

consider find your loan them right for\nCall a civilian gets stored\n[noise] hard dose John ... you hear the word on well [noise] and uh wanted to bring this segment in I Want to talk a little bit about\nSomething that oftentimes is overlooked [noise] when it comes to ownership so whether you have a bank account whether you have an investment account whether you have a piece of real estate a or a car any thing that has\nA title to it right folks to think of it this way\nI own a television but you know what a television is personal property it doesn't have a title to it if I Want to sell my TV to someone\nI can sell it to anybody I Want I could give it to anybody I Want and I don't have to sign a piece of paper that's transferring that ownership now I could if I Want to do some type of the bill of sale for personal property\nAnd I can say I uh agreed to sell this television set to this person for this price and I could write the check number that the person gave me or they paid me cash or whatever and that's just an agreement between the two of us so in case there's any\nEver an issue of whether or not I sold the TV to someone I Would have proof of that so that's always good to have\nBut I'm Talking about ownership of an asset that absolutely cannot be transferred unless there's a change to some type of a tidal on it whether it's a deed for real estate a certificate of title for your automobile or a bank account whatever it is it actually has an ownership\nA title to it and for that purpose I'm going to bring on estate planning attorney Jonathan months with us today hey Jonathan how are you a John how are you oh pretty good boy you got to get that find that it has that better a little bit better guy like that better hey Johnathan ah so you heard me talk a little bit about\nUh this whole idea of transfer of ownership\nOr depending on what the acid is and how those things have to happen and uh I the reason and bringing this up is because I really want to talk about real estate but ... why don't you give us a quick synopsis about what I just said either confirm or deny a that what I said it has any truth or a or not to it\nSo the way that you can do things right right on it together as tenants in common anything right means we each have an interest in it typically fifty fifty interest in fact could be a sixty forty it simply means that I owned sixty percent of this and I can do whatever I Want with it and upon my death it's my state that determines what happened to my sixty percent okay\nRight and the other person forty percent of Bayer deceased and I have to deal with their their loved ones\nA joint tendency when we say joined tendency would write a survivorship it means if I pass away my entire interest goes to you and vice versa okay I could be among three people so my interest goes to you both of you right so we have joined tendency now I'm\nFor married couples they sometimes have something called community properties righteous survivorship when you're married couple and you go to set up a bank account you set it up as joined tenants to Riley right\nOn time into the writer survivorship it means that of John passes everything goes to Tracy Tracy passes everything goes to John okay right\nNow the same thing applies to real estate the mistake people make is that when my by something at the store so for instance that doesn't have a title associated with it like a TV right bed and I just owned it it's personal property correct but I own it so there's no we don't have a way that it's we waited it's titled so\nTypically we've assumed I'm In the past that that things with a title our cars\nReal property right but but we also make the mistake of not knowing that there is also a bank accounts brokerage accounts right right I raise are typically owned individually but you name beneficiaries correct\nI'm so even if you're married and so if you're married and you have an IRA or four one K. the typical beneficiary be your spouse unless they sign off right you think this is my four one K. or Iraq can do whatever I Want with it but if I'm married and not leaving it to my spouse it's likely that companies going to ask me to do it I have that ... right right right\nSo people make this mistake and they think well husband wife we own it so when I pass everything go to him or her okay\nI Will just say this or I just want my kids to be on my account so it all go to them\nLike we throw around these ways that we should own things and sometimes we make a mistake so for instance we'll have a bank account and we think well I'm an ad my son that way my son can make decisions we don't realize we just made her son an owner\nRight of eke out in the bank doesn't tell us because frankly the bank savvy enough to understand what they've even done right right because it's typically someone who has received forty five minutes of training who's now filling a boxing the computer that now makes this other person and owner right right I Do this with a safety deposit box because I simply want to my dad to have access to it and I gave up\nBecause I couldn't convince the bank so I'm just telling you this happens to me to write and I couldn't convince the bank or they just want to my dad to have access if I was on available right that was too complicated for them so I just gave in and made him an owner ... now I trust him with my life right beside my dad and he's only ever going to do right for me because you only ever has done right for me my whole life sure so that that's a no brainer but I was a little thrown\nRight here I Am thinking I Know what I'm doing and I'm savvy and yet I I struggled with the bank so so for the layperson it's really hard because they just don't know what they're doing to be very careful and be very aware of how things are own so typically you don't want to take someone's word for it you want to actually see the document shows how its own right like show me how its own show me the title\nNow just becomes even more importantly real property\nRight so it was real property as I was mentioning Jonathan uh there's going to be an ownership a document which is the deed in other words so if I bought a piece of property from someone else\nThere's going to be a deed that's going to show they sold me the property\nAnd this is different from mortgage documents this is yet from the dean of trust this is different from all the other paperwork you have there will be a special warranty deed a quick claim to eat something that says deed on the top that has been recorded with the county\nAn okay I'm speaking with estate planning eternity Jonathan months I'm John ... this is the word on well folks has always you can check us out on the Web at Grand canyon planning dot com you can tune and listen to us or as well uh each week as we as we go through these scenarios and we\nTalk about these things is is really what we're talking about now ownership of an asset and how you should potentially own a piece of property especially if you're trying a in many cases people are trying to avoid probate\nAnd we talk about ways that you can avoid probate and some times people will put someone else's name on their property as a joint\nTenant and I want to talk really Jonathan and caution people that this may be for some people a a wrong a way to transfer that property upon\nDeath and because you give up some rights and you also expose yourself to some liabilities and again that's why you're here you're the legal professional I'm not giving legal advice here I'm just speaking generally but Jonathan if I own a piece of property and I want\nA to avoid probate and I have a couple of kids but I just say you know what I'm going to put my son's name on the property with me as a joint tenants so that when I die it's going to go to that person\nI I there's there's some things really potentially that can go wrong", "show_name": "The Word On Wealth w John
