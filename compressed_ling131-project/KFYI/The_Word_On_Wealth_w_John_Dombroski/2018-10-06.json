to take\nA minute by jak to the nursery and we have a youthful weather here for planting you know this is a hundred degrees Seventy degrees eighty degrees in the morning you know from now see the end of October is the best time to plant trees the reason why is because they all root all winter and they'll flushing grow faster\nNext spring especially important for trees that loved the heat things like mosquitoes ... iron\nWhich raised you know all of your palm trees citrus trees\nYou know when you plant I'm here in the fall they'll grow much faster it much better than if you wait till spring and it would fills me groceries now for four generations thousands the trees growing right here in Arizona we deliver implant and guarantee were license bond uninsured we have phenomenal planting cruise we are average planning crew foreman them with is\nPlanting trees for over Twenty years many of 'em up to Thirty years okay we're getting a little old what can I tell you but you know what with age does come experience and maybe a little more patients at times we try but come out and see us which\nCells were open Monday through Saturday is eight to five thirty Sundays tend to for\nA Fifteen gallons to big Seventy two inch box ... if you need to replace a tree that blew over in the wind if you want some shade you want to buy some time and have it now the other development I'm only want to make it look like it's been there for a while come out and see what feels no jobs too big no jobs too small\nFrom one street to a thousand well deliverance land guarantee whatever your deeds are for your perfect landscape originals stored eight twenty four he's Glendale they east valley Cooper\nWhich is the same as safely and Guadalupe\nOr twenty six forty seventies southern avenue\nSouthern avenue straight south of the sky harbor airport we also invites you Monday through Saturday is from seven to three to our big farming Stanfield ... road\nJust about a half miles south of interstate ... which still nursery since Nineteen forty six and my grandfather started all\nGrowing trees right here in the valley but right back to the phones Tim and Tim be good morning to [noise]\nUh [noise] is and I look around and they were real together and we're getting one died\nAnd the other two are like I don't know\nAbout\nOkay so these are real tall narrow pine trees Tim\nYeah they're real\nAnd those are Canary Islands pines okay how do you water it any way to get a sure drip yeah so how often you run your drill\nA\nWell I'm not sure [laughter] we might be trying\nThat drifts probably putting enough water out to make a difference anyway so what you wanted to go make sure you're drip systems working and you want to turn it on her running for like a day or to\nGet the ground wet\nAnd uh and then probably don't need water them if they're big or pine that depends on on those on the system any more this time of year than about once a month but you need to run them for probably a day or two you need to put on several hundred gallons of water it would be a great time to go ahead and feed them right now I'm\nKind of like organic nitrogen in fact they really love blood bill would be a very good fertilizer for them but if that's not practical for you can fertilize with like citrus food or something else like that mix it up in a bucket\nPort around there and water it in real well and um they probably had problems last winter with aphids because we had a very dry winter and we haven't had any cold temperatures and we also you know until the summer had a generally huge lack of rain\nSo you have spider might speeding army of aphids feeding on them\nThey're not getting very much water and they just haven't had a very good time but if you want to save them fertilize them right now changed irrigation so they get a really good deep irrigation at least once a month and ah they should put some new growth out this fall does the should start to put new candles and growth out over the next month or so [noise]\n[noise] mhm [laughter] clean up out of there\nNow you can if you watch it that doesn't make much difference to the tree you know there were the clusters of the old needles are and then naturally that blows out like a monsoon storms but that doesn't really make that much difference the tree but what will make a difference ... getting some water and fertilizer on it and then if we don't have any rain this winter\nOr you might want to treat them with a systemic insecticide like in December\nOr something that has like a bear systemic insecticide there hasn't been a corporate in it and that will kill those aphids that really build up in the wintertime\nAnd also reduce the spider mice as well\n[noise]\nThank you Bye bye ah let's see next up we're got Carol over to Gilbert good morning Carol\n[noise] well I ran a lot of learning from you [laughter]\nYou know what I I I Love learning from all the callers Carol [laughter]\nI got two quick questions one can

and this time of year Carol little trick to it is to Sylvia leave the center of it up tall with three or four those branches coming up tall\nProving the sides way back give it a light does the fertilizer not too much for the light dosage you wanted to work fast something like ... years or miracle grow a water soluble fertilizer you know now\nAnd um then it'll start to grow new budget foliage all besides that effort does that cut the centerpiece of it out and you'll have a much thicker smaller full are blooming I missed is\nOkay great cut out the sides and let the middle ground\nYeah just one tall piece on and so this got something to keep the ... the the sap flowing and its ability to recover and uh then after it flushes out on the sides then cut that center piece office bill\nOkay great [noise] the other question what would you recommend ... something along the side walk into the house that caller from that some might prevent and drought tolerant and doesn't drop a whole lot of stuff but at the collar\nHow it's all you want to be careful\nThree for maybe three ... pretty much like a head size kind of thing um what kind of exposure a lot more than ...\nLost his son and wife dialed landscaping you have ... lawn or rock or body have\nI'm now we've got grass grass okay yeah well if you want to really nice heads with it and kind of rock okay\nYou know you could plant like a hedge of iceberg roses on both sides and keeping manicured and you know determine three or four times a year but their floor abundance of bloom for ten months they'll have white flowers on them and they'll make a really nice little hedging the entryway like that\nOr anything else that in and out of it\nWell you know I even remember icebergs are different 'cause they're not like a lot of maintenance like the hybrid tea roses are there for ... and they are different but you could look a little John bottle brush\nA bottom\nAnd the little John bottle brushes that dwarf bottle brush which will have color on it and a very low maintenance pretty easy to grow 'em and then if you want you know you'll be printed a lot more but you could always the easiest thing probably of all the ...\nRight I thought of that from my antenna one year we had they've kind of also froze\nWell but with land than if they freeze you just cut them back to the ground that come right\nBack

related to tax or estate planning or financial planning please send me those emails\nTo a dear John at the word on wealth dot com that's dear John at the word I'm well tax comment will try to get to some of those two out show um it is\nA let me bring down on down how you doing I'm doing very good to have you as always here and we appreciate your joining us I've got a couple of questions I Want to get to in a moment but I just wanted to kind of talk about a few things before we do that which we had a a a lot of things going on this week I was still dealing with the cabin on um issue a\nThat was just going on and on who knows where it where we are going to wind up with this thing we've got um Amazon today raising their Annette today this past week I was on a Tuesday actually raising their\nMinimum wage I don't know if you heard about that up to ... dollars an hour now that's for all us employees course they they have employees all over the world but for the United states employees a part time and fulltime minimum wage now for that company is going to be Fifteen dollars per hour it's gonna be interesting to see\nWhat this means for the rest of corporate America\nWhen you've got companies like Walmart is one of the largest employers a nationally I think their minimum wage was set at eleven dollars an hour now I Would say this between Amazon and between Wal Mart\nThey're not similar companies I guess in some respects they are but you've got the Wal Mart stores right versus an on the huge on line ... preference or presidents that Amazon has and thinking about opening up some some brick and mortar stores also but I Would say I guess Walmart does have\nA online presence as well uh what's your thoughts on this minimum wage what do you think it means is it mean that inflation is here I mean obviously to hold on to employees I think you've got to raise your your ah wages probably right you know\nI I think it's an interesting approach I mean is that part of what a ... you know we Amazon would have experienced some pretty good a\nTax savings with the the new tax arrangement into you know maybe that's the way for them to pass it or has through some of those savings on to the entire company\nPopulation right um but again\nI I think the good thing about it is it wasn't legislated in the company actually made its own decision right I think they probably felt a little bit of pressure from Bernie Sanders I mean he's been pushing hard on pushing on hands are based in Washington right yeah and I think Seattle or Washington as a whole I think they may have a minimum wage of\nIf it's not Fifteen dollars an hour is pretty close right and I would imagine they have a pretty good population of employees that are in\nRight on the Washington yeah well it's interesting to see I'm Wondering what's going to happen as I said what's the fall I'm going to be for the rest of corporate America well a lot of other companies follow suit on this or I think that what is the national minimum wage is still in the mid seven dollar range is seven fifty an hour or something like that yeah I think ... loves like ten fifty as yet I think it's a state\nBy state threatening ... it's probably mid seven dollars ... it's probably touching a\nYeah at this point so again we'll see what happens with that that was interesting uh and again folks as always if you'd like to get your questions answered on there you could send me this email question said dear John at the word on wealth that calmed down I Do want to get to an email and this was\nFrom rod and rod has a question about\nHe has is a solo four O. one K. that he's contributing to he's still working he's Seventy two years old so he does have to take required minimum ... distributions from his four oh one K. um and he also has an IRA outside of the four oh one K. that he's not contributing to end this question is can I just\nPut both of those account values together basically and take one are empty based on the value of both accounts well the interesting\nThing is if you just have IRAs you let's say you have four or five IRA you can do what's called aggregating ... you can take all of your distributions out of one income okay um but when you throw four one K. into the mix ... you can't do that anymore aggregating does not work so\nI'm rod would have to take an armed the from the four one K. this'll if we're going to write and take her um these from his\nIrish and a half so rod hopefully you're listening that's the answer to that question a and one of the reasons is that your individual retirement account is is pretty much it's not regulated by Arista right these arrests of plans right all different these these company sponsored plans even though you're to solo far one capture you have a\nSome type of a professional corporation or else the that\nYou've created and you've created a four O. one K. for that that company and even though you're the only contributor to it and the only member of that uh it's still falls under a different\nCategory than in IRAs what you're saying does a ... and there are some nuances that we've talked about on the show before um solo four one K. is\nUm you can continue contributing to those after you're Seventy and a half ... it's all she I think as long as you to have income um you do have to take her um do you use because you're greater than ... percent owner on a ... by definition yes you're greater than five percent owner right\nUm but even in normal for one shape programs if you're a ... a still employed with\nLet's use the Amazon or something so you're not a five percent owner and Amazon are over Seventy and a half to many five percent owners and I'm now not become family members or with a ... ... less than ... ...\nUm but even in that situation you're over Seventy and a half you don't have to take minimum distributions if you're participating in their four one K. right because you're less than five percent owner and the company will so\nThat's one of the issues the other thing that the has come up just recently is a ... you know those are becoming more and more popularly as their grade vehicles\nUm you don't have to take a armed used for maybe a raw fire Rachael Price but strangely enough the government does require you to take a an arm the from a a raw\nBorrowing day interesting yeah so for those of you out there who have raw four oh one case one option could be as for you to roll that Ross IRA over into a traditional i._r._a. if you're over the age of seven and a half or you're approaching that\nMost plans or even if you're still working allow for what's called than in service distribution ring service roll over we do this all the time for a client\nOnce you attain the age of fifty nine and a half in other words you can extract money from your current four one K. even if you're still working even if you're still contributing to it without interrupting anything you can roll over many times a portion of\nThe proceeds that are in either the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Word On Wealth w John Dombroski", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "06"}
