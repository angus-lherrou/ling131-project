which still nursery now for four generations growing trees for you\n... the next step we got Joe in central Phoenix Hi Joe\nGood morning thank you Brian for the show um I have a drainage system that has roots Jeanette\n... sulfate is that like in moderation but the problem is is the French string so it runs and other plants\nYou know it's really tricky job when you have the French scream like that because if you ah have a lot of roots in your drain system and he killed the roost with a chemical was gonna go back into some of your plants oftentimes burning kill the plants to\nWhat you might want to try and there is something that's a more of just you know basically said needs to be toxic just right to the reached that point I might try some drain cleaner you know and if you go go to the hardware stores and you buy that one is so pure acid battle pretty much burned the roots up with the problem you have is they're going to come back\nSo I deal with what you'd want to do is find the plants that are rooting into your dream to cut the roots off outside of the patio before they hit the drain our way closer to the tree and manually you know proven those roots back that way and probably not have them waster trail that goes from where the plants are toward the drain is\nBut it it can definitely cause a lot of problem to your plants when we're cleaning out drains to\nOkay All right thank you thinks\nJoe by by ah let's see ah Laurie in Phoenix good morning or\nGood morning I N I have a few trees that have currently lead what caused it that\nIt's a little insect called rep and it just loves interest as much as we do and when they're actively growing when the new growth is coming out is feeding on the little tiny leaves and its scars their tissue and then as they grow out into larger leads to a very cruel misshapen\nFortunately here in the desert we have a ... which are the little Green Dragons slide you see flying around some time especially in the summer and their little larvae are like little alligator so they little lay eggs on ... street\nIn the ... actually eat this rap now sometimes with young trees you might want to actually spray them but typically in most large ... you're going to see some trip damage you know with the leaves had been grilled within Mother Nature comes in to back it up with the little lace wings they eat the bad guys [noise]\nOkay basically leave it alone\nOn larger citrus trees that wouldn't beat all concerned with the more\nOkay get the younger just a baby trees yeah OK okay\nAll right great thank you thank you ... you to buy a Diana in Phoenix good morning Diana good\nMorning I I have two questions Brian I found something in my yard that this is what it looks like it looks like it's only like two or to rent a car and it looks like watermelon seeds hooked onto it\nOr you know all the lagoon family like all the ... they put out those little leaves what leaflets like watermelons do you get the ... first and little ... come up and then after that they go into their mature lethal which so it's probably some type of a desert tree\nOh well I Know one of the patients with allergic to I had to have to cut down\nWell if he if you had an occasion there that was cut down it very well could be in a case you're Palo Verde or a mosquito all those are going to germinate look the same when are you OK\nOkay they caught the allergy I'll be\nWell they do when they bloom I mean you know if you have an allergy to mosquito I mean pretty much you're going to have the problems with mesquite trees in a march whenever there and bloom\nRight you know it's for about a month just wrapped a couple of months\nUsually less than a month you know most most most of the desert trees are in bloom less than a month especially the mosquitoes indications\nDelicious you know we had uh my wife Tracey brought in some pumpkin muffins for everybody and that was on Thursday we all enjoy does um but pumpkins are out one of the main symbols of Halloween right because we've got Halloween right around the corner as well uh coming up on Wednesday or some fun facts about pumpkins the largest\nPumpkin in the world weighed in about one thousand one hundred and forty pounds wow can you imagine that\nEleven hundred and forty pounds a pumpkin how many pies do you think that would have made I Wonder if the pumpkin or would taste as good right a lot of times the larger a pumpkin I Wonder if it would have the same flavor as maybe some of the medium to smaller size pumpkins anyway I don't know I'm not I'm not necessarily be big pumpkin\nPie kind of a guy but ah I Know a lot of people do like pumpkin pie but he put a little ah whipped cream on anything or ice cream and it tastes good [laughter]\nAll right um you know one of the things we talk about uh each week is a weak little weekly tipped just out there and and and it's interesting because if you think about small business owners I come across this a lot with a small business owners as your business grows\nOftentimes you're so busy working within the business that you don't take the time to really look at some of the tax implications that may be affecting you in some ways that you could be\nHandling that business establishing some type of an entity for your business and utilizing a certain tax strategy to really be tax efficient within your business so having a good relationship with the tax professional becomes vital to any small business\n[noise] in a thorough tax professional can help you file correctly to make sure that you're not I'm missing any of the important deadlines to take advantage of certain deductions that you're legally entitled to sew a variety of benefits I Believe can come out of working with a skilled\nA tax professional and in most cases folks just because someone is a CPA doesn't necessarily mean that they work out with business owners maybe they're a CPA that really just works with individuals so you need to seek out\nA a good a firm to be able to make sure that you're getting the proper advice\nAnd I believe a long term that the cost that you may incur for that advice\nOr will the benefits far outweigh the cost is what I'm saying so I Know for myself I rely heavily on a seat a CPA for our for him and he's on my show regularly he'll be on the show later today Darren cigarettes\nYou hear him all the time on the show are\nThere for him as a nice view is on the hour thirty past dad when it breaks used talk five type\nOf a tax need whether it's individual or a small business medium size or even large businesses\nAre to be able to help you uh work through the the details and the intricacies of the tax laws that we all face out there things are constantly changing when it comes to taxes and want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of what's available and that we're not\nUh trying to take advantage of something maybe that is no longer available and then we don't want to ever get that letter in the mail about or you know from the IRS saying ah you know we've found a discrepancy on your tax return okay\nSo that's just my weekly tip or we also talk about the riddle each week we're going to get through this real quick we talked last week's read all the recap was what is the longest word\nIn the dictionary and the answer is smiles because there is a mile in between it [laughter]\nOh well that's a cute one but this week's read or what is seen in the middle of march and April that can't be seen at the beginning of either month what a scene in the middle of march and April that can't be seen at the beginning of either month\nSo hopefully you guys at work on that that's a tough one I don't know about that I don't have to look that one up myself art events this week of course we had some big big things happened this week how many have you bought a lottery ticket anybody\nI Know I bought some I don't buy them every week but I did I bought a lottery ticket uh and

think it was close to two billion dollar a mega million jackpot or someone in South Carolina so if you've got any relatives in South Carolina that have gone dark you'll understand why because they probably are the one that one or the or\nThe mega million jackpot wow that's that's amazing what would you do if you one after taxes it was just a little under a billion dollars and that's amazing isn't it it'd be hard to understand what to do at that point but it'd be fun trying to understand what to do I would I Would love that opportunity as I'm sure many of you would have as well [noise]\nUh on another note which is a horrible thing explosives apparently were sent to a variety of\nIndividuals' Hillary Clinton Obama Joe Biden CNN investor George Soros a Robert Deniro I mean obviously these are all a very active individuals uh in the Democratic party\nA but boy this is a horrible thing I Know the president did come out and denounced these things as he should have\nAnd all of a talk radio has done it as well\nUh ... obviously this is not something that anyone wishes or any type of harm to come to anyone like this and and and we hope that they find the individuals who have done this and can make them a you know\nOr go through the court system and hopefully put them in jail for for this this is certainly something that should never happen and hopefully it never will again but unfortunately a lot of people out there that do things like this um but anyway uh\nSo okay folks were going to take a short break when we come back to the break we're going to get into\nThe

toxin [noise] income planning and there's a\nLot of things that when it comes to your retirement say you have to be said about market conditions are part of it what's happening in the world economics [noise] uh and there is a lot happening right now as we can see with all the volatility that we're faced within the markets but that aside that\nAll the things that we do to gather all of our savings and investments and build our network throughout our working career at some point\nWe're trying to transition those things to the next\nIn line our loved ones whether it's our spouse whether it's our children whether it's a charitable organizations whatever it may be we're trying to figure out a way to simplify this and and pass our\nOur assets to our next generation is simple and affordable way however there are times when people have these brilliant ideas about trying to give things away for whatever the reason may be\nFor that I'm going to bring an estate planning attorney Jonathan Montana want to talk about that hey Jonathan how you doing\nJohn how are you fantastic you know I was just thinking it's in a side note yes the problem really is is that everyone is always trying to take a short cut they got everybody really started trying to take a short radio were to go back to this topic but let me go far afield\nIn a little anecdote about about this everyone's trying to cut corners right so there's this museum in Washington DC among many museums writers to ... they're sitting there so this is the Bible museum and his Bible museums or giant it's a giant big thing that probably a lot of people haven't heard about the right published but it's a big museum with a lot of\nAntiquities are supposedly antiquities and it's the um it's the passion project to the founders of Hobby Lobby ... do they created this museum and it's a bona fide museum has a museum curator it's a nonprofit the whole thing it's complete\nIt's a complete legitimate museum at his displaying biblical artifacts right and so\n[noise] during the buildup to create this museum um\nThe founders of Hobby Lobby um went on a buying spree and all of a sudden there were these shards of or fragments of the dead sea scrolls that came up for sale and then they bought a whole bunch of them\nAnd then they were just plain parts of these pieces apartment in their museum thinking that they were real well pay they found out that they weren't real and they found a bunch of them back to Germany to be tested and they realize they weren't that they were fake oh boy so so my point being here is that they\nThought you know what I mean like there's so so I use this example to try to say that people are always trying to cut corners and so here you have some people doing something that was really important to them right um and they were willing to pay for a legitimate product right and then you have people out there who are lying about this product and if you can believe that someone would actually like falsify or self fake\nYeah biblical antibody has I mean you can't really think of anything lower right now so I just say that like nothing really surprises me anymore and I and not anecdotal really liked that upset me a little bit that that would even happening right that they would that there would be a group of people are a group of people that actually came up with this idea that we are going to sell fake pieces of something that\nPotentially could be really important for a lot of people are like Jeff worlds for ...\nSo we take that now back to a state planning and people are always given advice or on Google about ways to like okay well\nI can give money away and that way qualify for benefits or I can give money away and or I can put money over here and then I don't have to pay my taxes upon my hide hide this and in fact a shield is right and my point is we that just doesn't work you know that just doesn't work and it never works and it's not a good idea and so the worry year is that if I think that I'm going to get a benefit\nI'm not just take my anecdote I had to get that out there because it just kind of that was shocking to me than someone would do that but it but but I bring that back to the point here where really nothing should shock you anymore so before you make a decision about doing something for a state planning lots that's talk to our financial advisor ... planning attorney that's talked to our CPA yeah he's right\nAnd so in this case when we think that we're going to help our grandfather or mother or father or uncle qualify for benefits and we think that we need to like have them give away assets that might not be the best thing to do right right because in many instances\nSome of these programs have look backs right which simply means that if I\nIf I give money away within a certain amount of time it's going to still be considered mine until that time\n... states the governments are out there on they understand what people are trying to do John it then and they they realize that hey if if we're going to give you a benefit you have to have\nA reason to receive that benefit and of course fight if you're financially fit for yourself and you can afford to pay for certain benefits why would the government ... and then we see this all the time and and the variety of different areas that the government does help those in the end so\nThat the initial inclination is all my uncle Mary gave stuff away and she qualified for benefits you should write and this is actually real case you know that that I had someone who said well my aunt did this why can't my parents do this right well because\nI'm your aunt lives in Florida and your parents live here mhm right that doesn't or your aunt didn't have the money or parents have there were missing piece here so everyone always thinks well I'm gonna do I just want to do with my aunt did well I'm telling you right now that things are typically more complicated and the way they're explain to you and there's typically other options that we want to see\nIt it's no different than when someone says that they have an investment that guarantees you a Fifteen Percent return right right just that just okay 'cause I Want to sign up for that\nAnd you hear sometimes a disclaimer that says you know past performance as yet indicative of future performance blah blah but I mean things guarantee\nSo the ideas we want to do things that we know that work and that that that are going to accomplish our goals and so the idea is we want to sit down and we want to talk about what your goals are so in many instances giving money away or simply ... assets in someone else's name", "show_name": "The Word On Wealth w John Dombroski", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day":
