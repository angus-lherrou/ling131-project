[laughter] they're going back program and [noise]\nI um [noise] I Want to talk to a little bit about the book addicted to outrage today if you have read it or listen to it on audio book\nOr I Want to talk to you about it we're going to we're going to do this again next week we were going to dedicate show to this today but uh we have Malcolm Gladwell and I just don't want to cheat him on time and I don't want to cheat the the book on time either\nBecause there's a lot in there we have to discuss so Malcolm Gladwell is joining us next hour we will take your phone calls if you've read the book if you have and you have um you know something that you disagree with or\nYou know you you found really really interesting or you want clarification on you can call a eight at eight seven to seven ... if you make it on the air today or we're going to take some of these calls next week as well um you will get assigned autographed copy of the book or of the audio whichever you prefer\nWould you say there is a pretty direct ties between the stuff you're talking about in the book and what we're seeing over the past few days\nOff of the calving off are you are you there I Hope you have recognized this and seen this ... this vindicate the book one hundred and ten percent what's happened is because as I've said since since the trial or the hearing last\nWeek the Republicans are playing this perfectly I have not seen the Republican Party ever behave in a way that I thought ten from the American judge\nTen from me and this fits exactly\nTo my point in addicted to outrage people think that ... and this is why it's taken the book to be able to it it's taken me a year and I wrote I wrote the book once and then I rewrote it a second time 'cause it wasn't right 'cause I learned so much as I was writing it\nAnd the um the point of the book people look and say that's a surrender you want us to surrender no I don't I don't\nI Want you to change your approach because that's the path to winning they'll let me show you in the book you will see it without Cavanaugh I Wish Kavanaugh had happened before the book because I Would have used this as the case first\nLock yourself on to the truth but be open enough for a new information\nSo you don't just stay blind if there is new information you have to take that into consideration right or what you know to be true\nSo now let's watch what ... what happened with Kevin off for the first time a president this time it's it's a Donald Trump\nTook one of the brave as physicians I think I've seen a president do\nThis was I think this was worse than Clarence Thomas because we are in the meat to society where you just go along with it you don't change you don't defend your just everybody just blindly goes oh my gosh yes he did it he is a pariah\nSo the stakes are higher\nThan they were in Nineteen Ninety One and also that the society has changed remember we were still tolerating you no monkey business and sexual harassment and everything else that wasn't what it is now\nThe hierarchy has changed the power structures have changed now you must blindly believe the woman\nAnd you've seen people I mean look at the hits we took on Bill O'Reilly because I said Bill O'Reilly ... I'm Sorry I won't take it on somebody else's\nI'm a word I've worked with him we've seen him in social situations it may be true I've talked to him personally I I heard his explanation\nI give him the benefit of the doubt oh my gosh the world ended when I did that guy I lost friends over that okay well whatever so you do not surrender but as I said\nWith Bill O'Reilly if I find new information and Bill O'Reilly actually is that dude I'm going to be the first to torture him\nI heard you say that to his face yeah or or on the phone yeah you know you said to him yeah look if if if this turns out to be something that I cannot be associated with I'm Down to the lowly yeah and he was he was fine with him trying [laughter] and so what did the Republicans do first they stood with Kavanaugh because\nThey believed he had a right to answer these charges but they didn't mock her\nThey did say this is a sham because look at the facts\nIf they want if if she would have um appeared during the hearings\nAnd you said well this is a sham cars look out at ... no no no no there's still time but because it came out and the eleventh hour there were facts that led to the Republicans to say and I think any human to say okay wait a minute or slow down on\nThis but what did we do the Republicans then said let's\nHear her they were gracious tour they said we'll come see you what happened the Democrats lied\nThe Democrats through a flaming or an insult to anyone who said that the Republicans it invited her and she said no you are a monster\nThe Republicans did not respond in kind\nThen they sat down and they listen to her did you see the way that she was treated in the line of questioning nobody rolled their eyes on the right nobody mocked her while she was there\nEvery one was deferential everyone was kind to her everyone wanted her to feel comfortable to speak in case she had something actual to present\nMost Republicans went into watching those hearings with an open mind\nI listened to her and I thought okay she has some credibility here now it's time has gone on that has gotten less and less as more facts have come out but I wanted to hear cabinet if Kavanaugh didn't have a strong response\nI Would have probably been and said I you know I don't know I I think Kavanaugh's ... I don't know\nI was at least willing to consider that point Kavanaugh spoke I said I Believe Kavanaugh\nOut of the two of them I Believe then it came to the FBI they said look it's just I mean you can't give us seven days just give us seven days okay I'm not for it because I Know what the Republican or the Democrats are actually doing which they did\nBut okay Jeff Flake said seven days so we gave them seven days it's still not good enough for them\nBut nowhere has the Republican Party up until and this is debatable up until a Donald Trump mocked her the other night and I don't think he did he mocks the process he mocked her evidence you didn't lock her he mocked the evidence\nThe evidence is marketable\nLiberate the Democrats are multiple but you'll notice no one in the Republican Party has has taken her apart called her name's or anything else\nWhat they did do based on evidence and facts\nWhat's happening you're seeing a shift in the polls you're seeing people start to say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you starting to see people back the Republican Party you're seeing people start to back this entire process as being a sham\nBecause we allowed the people to come up with that we allowed the people we just said let's look for facts and the facts will speak for themselves\nYou go to filter by B.

[noise] go to\nIn Colorado hello Brian how are you [noise] good how are you doing very good thanks for calling in what's on your mind yes so quick question\nIt's kind of going off of your book now with the whole cabinet and going on all the attention seems to have turned away from Trump 'cause there's no outrage there or the allergies with Kevin or some kind of wondering how you see the interplay between that\n[noise] um because Kavanaugh is an easier target because Donald Trump has not responded in the fashion that they probably expected him to respond and the reason why\nI Would imagine is because you know he doesn't have a you know a good record on speaking about you know moral issues\nAnd so somebody has said ... shop\nAnd he has that has that has given him real power\nBecause all the Trump is a is involved on this is\nIs he going to keep standing and because he has a spine yeah he's standing and that's what the president needs to do at this point and it is also allowed for the very first time\nIt's given a spine to the Republicans so they had to\nGo after Kevin uh what what else are they going to do he's the he's the target but Kavanaugh also has remained cool um until it was really appropriate had he come out and made crazy you know angry statements prior to\nKnow but his his timing of being angry is not a sign that he has a reckless temperament it was appropriate for the time if you are thinking human being and you'd you are looking at things\nFor you're looking at the facts level you completely connected with Kavanaugh's opening statement where he said this is ridiculous you have destroyed me you've destroyed my family he made a statement that was full of facts refuting the things that she had said it was totally appropriate\nWhat's the result the result is I think Kavanaugh is going to a win the nomination\nIf he doesn't and it will be ... be because a Republican or maybe a couple of Republicans lose their spine\nBecause there is there are no facts on this so they lose their spine if they do it they will be losers in this\nDoes that help you Brian is that what you were thinking\nYeah that does make sense that this kind of finding the weak target as opposed to the strong line and because that's what they do is they exploit the week and um yeah so I appreciate that\nI'm do onto it or I'm going to send you a book for getting on the air at risk and if you get on the air uh start sending your books if you did you want the book\nOr the audio yet the book is out of it okay and uh Bryan B R y a and B R I Am okay\nBut I asked thanks Bryan free she had it's in the mail or let me go to a\nYear it's still sitting right in front of an Brian don't believe it it's not in the mail yet liar and let me go to\nA let me go to Phyllis hello Phyllis\nCalled lining the Glenn how I Am I'm very good\nReason for my call as I wanted to tell you a couple of things I appreciate you taking my call ... and I've learned a lot from you over all these years so I thank you for that\nYou're welcome victim of sexual child abuse or my father was a pedophile and I suffered\nFor many many years until I put an end to it and unfortunately Glenn no one believed really knowing [noise]\nSo you know I just kind of felt I had to deal with this I have to get ... ... it's it's not easy to do that but I knew that\n... you know what happened was not going to get anywhere in life so I understand in a way why no one you know talked up and now these days you know twenty Thirty years ago\nIt was not the way it was it was not [noise] we weren't we didn't think people were like that and we didn't want to look at it if it was it's horrible we've made good progress on that\nYes we have however we swung from one end all the way to the other with no middle ground so what I'm Upset about is that everyone believes this this doctor\nOkay just on her ... a test to money which wasn't even you know significant and uh they're they they just believe that because of the help they went through and to me I don't understand why they don't listen to the facts\nAnd then Ronan Farrow who is built up all of his credibility with real reporting on things like Harvey Weinstein\nOr comes out and people take it seriously 'cause it's him\nWhen you read the story you find out about two thirds the way through that they couldn't find anybody anybody who had any recollection of this and in fact the woman who even brought it forward said she couldn't remember who it was she couldn't remember it was Brett Kavanaugh she just remembered it a couple of weeks ago that it was Brett Kavanaugh\nHow on earth when no one would print that and no one did right now that's in lumped into your multiple accusations\nThey followed up on it in one of the most\nAmazing stories I've ever seen they said Ronan Farrow again a comes out and says we found a a witness to the story to the ... exposing himself to college party\nWhen you read the story what you find out is a it was all here say they don't have anyone who was there it was people who said they heard about it at the time so it was one person comes and says I have a witness I Know this person they they'll do about it at the time listen to this quote from the story it's an incredible the the\nThe person who was in the story says he initially asked to remain anonymous because you hope to make contact first with a classmate who did the best of his recollection told him about the party and with an eyewitness to the incident so the source of this person come into New Yorker he I Want to talk to that person to confirm it\nHe said that he had not been able to get any response from that person despite multiple attempts to do so okay really shady why would you put that in ... listen to the next census remember this article was printed\nThe New Yorker did reach the classmate and he said he had no memory of the incident\nOh my gosh I mean\nThey ... they are so desperate to get this guy off the Supreme Court that they will do anything Ronan Farrow is Burt is lighting his career although fire right now so you're up here is the best thing Donald Trump has done during this whole thing\nHe has allowed to the press without blocking it up speaking he's been pretty good yeah without without tweeting stuff and and becoming the story himself he has allowed the press to prove\nEverything that he says about the press is true [noise] [noise]\nIs no way to fight this is\nThe way and it's outlined in addicted to outrage doesn't mean surrender it means\nChanged the way you're fighting men don't surrender ... unless the facts James\nGarfield give you've taken your car in\nAnd uh uh and all of a sudden you're like oh wait how much is that can you not do that to the car can you just can you just undo everything you just did 'cause I don't have the money\nUh you know you have a sensor that goes off and it's you know by the way I think all cars I think it should be free have you ever ... current and the sensor light is faulty so you bring it in and it's showing you take your\nCar in for repair but it's the sensor that's faulty so your car doesn't need to be repaired the sensor life that tells you it's faulty his faults in I think the car companies should replace that one for free that should just be their fault that one's on that one's on us anyway sensors can cost like a thousand dollars\nNot to you if you have car shield you don't have to worry about those surprises I Want you to visit car she'll dot com and find all find out all about this uh

Facebook potentially exposing the personal information of nearly only fifty million\nAnd nobody seems to notice imagine the media headlines on CNN and MSNBC and the New York times but everyone seems just to accept this now why because they are certain they are correct\nAnd if you want to have a different opinion you have to do whatever you have to do to stop that opinion from being furthered from being explored heard to listen to\nAmerica ... clearly if this doesn't scare you yet\nWhat will\nThis behavior on the left whether it's a it's a fall or whatever is going down in DC is the new norm\nThere is my small hope that when Kavanaugh is passed when he is accepted and put on the Supreme Court on Saturday the left will learn ... well that didn't work\nIf he is not confirmed they will learn this works and it will get much worse\nThere are no calls for the left to de escalate at least on the left Rand Paul's wife wrote an incredible op ed for CNN begging begging the Democrat to retreat from this and de escalate\nThey're out of control\nWhat happens on Saturday after Kavanaugh is confirmed what happens when the next big issue comes up what happens what happens if the Republicans hold\nThe Senate and Ginsburg dies what happens Democrats\nAren't really these people in and condemning their actions like Maxine Waters they are egging them on and the media is to eat is painfully obvious obvious they hold the violent left to a completely different set of standards than the quote violent\nRight\nI don't know who the violent right is by the way the violent right I guess they would say that's the national socialist party\nBut as anyone who actually has the thinking cap on you know socialism is something the right is again so [noise]\nIt's Thursday October for [noise]\nDamon ... is a here and a David is a a friend of mine who was\nFor Donald Trump because he\nKept saying in my ear Glenn he is going to be really go to an judges and I kept saying David you're an idiot he's not going to do any of that\n[laughter] and you're exactly right and I was wrong\nOr what would the program David how are you good to be ... or so ... your gas on Kavanaugh\nIt's going to go down I I think it'll happen I think the ones that are sitting on the fence we'll go to the right direction\nThe one that makes me the most nervous displayed because he's retiring yeah everybody else is going to face the voters and be accountable but flake has been his own guy since he was in the house yeah so he he's the biggest biggest issue biggest problem but that when I get up to Fifteen then Pence goes forward\nWhat did you think about Ben Sasse is the comments yesterday\nHe now says I it it's like he's a he's like Mike Lee but he's a lot more vocal than Mike is he is a lot like an adult into this thing that every once in a while I'll get you a reality check yeah ... ... he goes off and has these great speeches every once in a while like these teach in a budget yeah to garden kill ya ya\nIs he is and it's All right if ... and I love him I did not see that and then before he got there and he's he's been an independent guy there's been an independent think are really like\nHim she is position for I think twenty twenty four yes positioning itself in a really good places being a reasoned\nLikeable a call ... individual\nWorrying individual yeah he's you know he's he's very reasonable and the way he goes you know the stuff he teaches is great\nSo David is a David has written a new book with a friend of mine James Carlo a vis precarious moment six urging steps that will save you your family in our country and a David it's great book and everybody should everybody should read it again it's a\nA book that is talking about the steps that you take right now and what I Love about this David is\nA let's just start on the millennial step um I have seen this work you know it's kind of my book is a ... I put it into action myself in my own life and I've seen it work\nDone the same thing and you've seen this work with millennials talk about the millennials\nMillennials right now I or one of the reasons we have a precarious or dangerous moment because we have two hundred and forty two years of being an American nation under the declaration three ... two hundred and thirty one on the constitution know nations ever survive that long and so we just kind of think will always be here\nAnd yet at the same time you have fifty five hundred years of recorded history and there's never been a socialist nation that's increased ... freedom or increase prosperity and yet right now Seventy five percent of students in college support socialism book all forms of government we cannot survive if that becomes the believe when they become leaders\nAre and and the same way for out of five millennials believe there is no absolute moral truth\nMan if we can agree that things like rape and murder wrong you get no chance for having a nation in the future you got fifty three percent of millennials who believe that free ...\nIt should be limited Nineteen percent who believe that violence is a riot response to ... to free speech you don't like you you can't survive as a nation so that's why we call it a bit curious moment but when you look at millennials\nThey are really um easy to change relational angry they are hungry if you if you create a relation of one on one relationship but they really don't care about your age they don't care about how you look at the care about whether you're sincere and if you are sincere and say and what we found works so well there's just asking questions\nBecause they really have had a low dumped on them by their professors and by the culture and they've not thought it through\nAnd when you start asking them questions and and not trying to win that's right not trying to win just just thinking I just I just\n... that's an interesting thing let me ask you a question how does whatever villain the blank they start to engage and and they I find that they actually they actually um begin\nTo move toward you faster\nAnd not not just blindly accepting things\nBut because you are engaging them and asking them to think as long as you're not trying to win this right nobody does that that's right in college they're being told what to think join in chant this and and if you have any other thoughts so when you challenge them\nThey actually like that it's the first time anyone has done it\nThey they really do respond to thinking well and what's it gets going there killer ... really\nI'm Sorry that's an old school ... ... oh I'm Sorry but I I Can't say that running at it that out yeah that's right but they really are ... and they're the most of all groups in polling for the hundred years have been ... they're the most relational group\nBut the stuff she went back to her professor started asking her professor questions he got all

you your family and your country\nUm a grab a copy of it it is really really good um and I agree with this steps and all the way through it\nYou are you are making the case using facts this is this is a book that you can take and read and learn all kinds of facts about the country that you didn't know\nFor instance let's talk about immigration David\nImmigration effect we didn't know is until Eighteen Seventy five Eighteen Seventy six the federal government had no part in immigration immigration belongs solely to the states when you came to America you didn't moving to the United states you moved to Texas or Maryland and Virginia or wherever and there was a state controlled immigration\nThe U.S Supreme Court and Eighteen Seventy five Eighteen Seventy six to decision said hey we think we'll take this over now\nAnd so the first time we have federal immigration is an Eighteen Ninety two when Ellis Island open assessed the first federal immigration facility everything before that was the states we have no clue and then when you look now the founding fathers were very good because article one section of the constitution says they can establish a uniform rule of naturalization\nSo they did they passed three laws Seventeen Ninety Seventeen Ninety five and Seventy Ninety eight said okay we can set the rule of naturalization here's what you gotta do to companies I stay and let's go through first\nUm that ... what what they set forward the immigrant must have good moral character are we doing anything to check on good moral\nCarol do background check and by the way Ben Franklin said that when you came you needed to have a certificate from a religious society a testing your good moral character from the country when she left\nThe immigrant must not only support the constitution and our government laws but renounce allegiance to any other nation or loyalty to any other system ...\nSharif and by the way we had Muslims in America since sixteen Nineteen but to be part of the country you had to agree to the constitution not compared to overturn it\nThe immigrant must believe in the equality of all Americans to renounce and renounced any title of nobility so would I have to\nIf I was coming in with I have to declare that I was not a member of the press [laughter] I'd have to like the title of ... or ... or a professor at Sarah okay uh there must be residency requirement for a a five years in the United states before citizenship\nNow let let me hit that one 'cause I was really shocked about that in the constitutional convention\nSeven of the thirty nine guys who signed the constitution were immigrants they were themselves immigrants and so ... Alexander Hamilton was one he came from West End these ... another and these guys said and ... I made the debates are great they said look when we got here\nIf we had voted we would have voted the way that we were thinking from the west indies and Ireland and elsewhere\nAnd pierce butler said you should not be allowed to vote until fourteen years here because you need to learn to think like in America\nOh my gosh with the Texas needs to do that with Californians always oh you're right ... ... ... I'm telling you were going to lose Texas because of the Californians they are just going to vote the way they voted out and we are not the same place that's what we're not the same play it on and and they think like California right takes a while\nSo Alexander Hamilton said five years and that's what they went with was five years but you could not vote in America until you've been here five years otherwise you would turn this place into wherever you just left\nNo anchor babies citizens goes citizenship goes from parents to child not to try not child's apparent\nWow security risk can be deported and permanently banned from the United states the government must protect the borders during times of war states will have a definite role in immigration so that is what they that's what they original immigration law okay\nHow I found it fascinating in the book that we have\nArgued as if these things were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language how dare you insist as if this was just some idea that a bunch of racist\nThere been Franklin is a great example because Ben Franklin talked about how so many Germans from moving in Pennsylvania and they were\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language there started to create signs in German they're starting to create documents and German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing\nHe said we have immigrants coming in which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration than in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separating from Great Britain 'cause he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration it's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nThere is you can build it up over time my patriots supply is the ... are the people that if they helped me with my food storage and I remember being overwhelmed by it I don't even know how to start seizing they'll help you\nEveryone in your household should have a four week emergency food kit\nThere's a special on 'em right now you'll save a hundred dollars when you go to my special website prepare ...

what people don't want to do that\nYeah I you know it's funny I had a conversation last night with a friend of mine who was a Mormon and who was talking about the tradition and the\nUm among Mormons of keeping journals which I had not known about mhm I'm ... years and years and years of journals and she was talking about what that means for\nWhen you have a contemporaneous account of of your life your feelings your actions you or interpretations of what you've done\nYou can go back and it it is obviously serves a function far greater than simply checking your memory yeah\nBut it's a way of keeping yourself on is what I loved about that was that that notion of if you we live in such a kind of difficult and flawed world\nThan we have to take responsibility for our own stories and that to me what is what the um what what that tradition of keeping a journal is about as as a human being you have a responsibility to your self and to others\nTo to understand the road that you have taken write and write it down so that when you Twenty years later you can look back and he said I\nI I had forgotten I did this then you don't maybe I regret it out maybe I've learned from it but that that to me I just thought that was lovely I really did I thought that was a as an example of a kind of a a a practice um and you will you know obviously know much more about this than I Do but\nThe the idea that that is part of what it means to be a righteous actor in the world is to take care history seriously\nHave you heard from Brian Williams sincere podcast\nNo [laughter] I have I threw out one

for holding hey\nNo no no problem I I got a question for you I I wanted to see what your thoughts are it seems like the Democrats know what the these press conferences coming up this morning or how to moving the goalposts going after limited time and and ... the six previous uh investigations that actually something might have been in there\nI Know I Know\nYou think this is going to have any traction or email or cast in Holland and no have I have imagine\nIt's not going to have like it's not going to have any interaction it's not going to have any traction the polls are all moving towards Kevin I'm In the behavior of the Democrats has has actually\n... gone against them because the Republicans played this right\nBecause they remain calm cool collected they treated the witness with respect\nWhen it was an FBI deal everybody thought it wasn't but one other guy stood up and said I think we should have seven days okay we'll have seven days well I Want the FBI not to be told what okay they can go any way they want well they like to expand it okay they can expand it\nWell there you go what what are you gonna do they they the rip the Republicans have played this exactly the right way calmly and Cooley and a openly and now all they have to do is just say enough is enough\nAnd the American people are going to put a put that is a a a marked for the Republicans I really believe that and I think\nSome of these hey hey Glenn do you think some of the Democrat Senator and you know like man Chen or in battleground states do you think they're gonna I sure will or just to save their you know save their cells\nCome over to the cabin outside yeah yeah I I think they will I mean I don't know what's in the FBI report but assuming that there is nothing new in the FBI report and you know this this whole argument of why they didn't talk to her well no we cause they re interviewed her\nFor three hours what did she have anything else to say what what are you talking about uh so I I think if I were mentioned I think still you'd be better at this you think those guys are going across\nA I think they probably will um because of their own personal interest right\nAnd I and I think the party will actually let them yeah I mean it looks like it's going to pass they're going to let them because they care more about votes than they do about\nPrinciples and the end of it and I you know I'd say this or if you look at the production markets the highest percentage of likelihood is fifty three votes not not fifty one or fifty which would be the Republican fifty three votes and I think you know mentioned in high camp or the to the probably the most likely\nI'm not that big thing about if you're in West Virginia\nI Would love to understand that because here's a guy here the state that Trump won by over thirty points right\nI mean think about this squishy senators that you throw out there for a Republican Orrin Hatch Mitch McConnell Lamar Alexander Lindsey Graham Bob Corker Jeff Flake John McCain when he was around uh Murkowski Susan Collins\nAll of those people vote with ah with Trump and the White House far more often not even close the closest one is Susan Collins and Eighteen percentage points she votes with Trump more than mansion\nYou want that guy in it representing you if you're in West Virginia and if he comes out today and and decides to go there
