that's a Chinese curse that it's really not that's not may you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find it being sad is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is\nAnd uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he said look [noise] not so long ago I spent some years of service in China and there\nThere was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses falling upon\nUs so it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that\nBecause I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a it's just the saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse I personally think it's a blessing\n\nMy dad taught me when I was

because they know better they know better they know more than we do that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family say that's not the cure\nBecause we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become more vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\nThat was the same time the doctor is not going to get more humble because the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing\nAnd well we're all fighting over the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were just too busy fighting what our doctor said\n\nNo I don't know about you but I Know you know we're sick I Know you know this society is sick we are sick and we are in pain and and when I Am sick or in pain I'm usually at my worst inner personally and usually I'm not good at making friends at that point\nI don't think you are either we snap at each other\nWe act as our lesser selves because when I'm sick I'm I hurt and I am full of despair or I'm fearful or I just don't have the patience\nAnd Everytime I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin conversations with I'm really so sorry I I was just in really bad pain or I was really sick I was having a really bad day\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd judging by our society today we're having a really very bad

politically correct nonsense and whining mercury\n... as a social construct and I ended up killing one of these pay pay or\nTo publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was fun we learned it was definitely fun you know a fun right hum that he misses\nDon't exist but because all of our problems anyway right [laughter] that [laughter] um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took\nThe criticisms we got from that to heart ...\nUh it was fun but it didn't work\nPeople criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge like a couple of thousand\n... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to\nAddress it a secondly we decided that\nUm we would use the highest ranked journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure then um\n[noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it does not have happened um\n[noise] and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nAll the easiest kind of look at what this is\nI had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took may be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nOn my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I know you talk to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work there was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and note that Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers in striking us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process\nAnd then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is\nThe absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars imbedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spanned Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted\nThe seven and so\nWe've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been cut short\nSo there's you know you I Know who you at twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten pulled\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so uh as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and\nCredible where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nAlright are us sponsored this half hour\nIs separate critter zipper critter is just as great company of ah of dreamers indoors\nYou know when they first started they were

analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about where dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we were today and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody areas that Ira\nAbout how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we indicates that we're human about dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being [noise] ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little video we put out to announce the project\nThey're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and we run out and so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] that it was done in the privacy of a a veterinary office either [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle\nAnd they say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity who wrote that who we claimed that paper and he actually has a professional body builder or Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this\nPaper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\n[laughter] 'cause that was another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking what it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a is this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit not on who did it\nAnd so a lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google

for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it does not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just say this is this an act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce they're determined how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means faced\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to\nThe way in a very privileged classroom learning environment and the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temporary thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and leftist fit in that without being completed\nAnd so they actually wanted to make it\nTerrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of\nThe a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claimed for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on but um\nBut the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or do we spoken\nOver interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published anywhere real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would would [noise] what's that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year so this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some ... some ... uh educators primarily working and social justice side or the fields topics\nCourses I get the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general and stuff who would take up some degree of these suggestions as\nThis is bad am I right that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine off of course do I mean as you get it for one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that if I can\nBecause all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called the stuffed grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to gain a touchy with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this all May of ...\nAbout\nHow things were going to under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge he's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right that's great I'm we're on the left needed a responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know or left wing people who want to ... to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um we're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to protect all attacks and as long as we're relying heavily on this ... stuff\nWhich clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media is here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't really remember you know you are an American I'm an American\nYour person I'm a person we have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details and I really hope that you know that our project kind of reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally

something like a you know a war where to break out these will change completely uh you know in\nThe vigil scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape to control the Senate and a really bad shape to continue their control of the house [noise]\nI mean look at the X. dream policies that the left is looking to push in through the Democratic party\nSingle payer but I'm Sorry single payer health care free health care free college I'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger a infrastructure package then what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's gonna be a lot more than ten I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all\nThe all the big names are for it already there but many of them were cosponsors of the bill uh it seems to\nBe this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racists for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just signed\nUp to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nHey no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state's said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\n\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right\nI might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by city I mean as you know it'd be which\nIt may not want that like as a Republican I certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way right let's say you should\nRun themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural areas can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb do farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's\nHeaded by the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the it out right\nAnd you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed\nBecause there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly then the next the the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way\nSo you go through another body that was much slower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto saying\nIf he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the ... this is the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nScrewed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme\nCourt and this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several stories in our own MIT give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber\nThis Swiss army knife has failed\n[laughter] or no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure part right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented\nBut the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane absolutely insane\nAll right let's go through a couple of other things about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but on the outside I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the
