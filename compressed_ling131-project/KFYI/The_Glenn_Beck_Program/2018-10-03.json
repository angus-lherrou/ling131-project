with\nI've seen you in the situation I think that that was a shot across the bottom I'm thinking that the President Trump you know he's hinting at Democrats indiscretions you it might be enough for the powers that be in the Democratic party\nTo all go oh\nMaybe we should let some of the lesser folks both for this\n\nOr maybe we should go ahead I'm that district confirmed because if it obviously President Trump after all they have done to him he's willing to go where no president has ever gone before\nI think he's willing to name names go and let all the big wig or make the bigwig a\nDemocrats go ahead and vote no let the small fry the ones who get we'll get burned by the too much that will go ahead and vote yes the president is not to play\nAnd the latest development here is

October ... gland that program [noise] All right\nSo [noise] I'm going to do [noise]\nI'm a little disturbed but All right [noise] I I Know I Know ah the ah the goalposts man they just they just keep moving I'm [laughter] I mean they must be tired but I think\nIt's their all their heavy the goalposts are getting heavier than having having your eye because there's a lot of the farther you move from the harder it is to justify\nOr if it this is incredible um though I Am very disturbed course by these new allegations against Brett Brett Kavanaugh that he ... through frozen water at someone prism on her first of all or can it can be heavy um\nYou know what it means people are like oh it's not a big deal so what do you through ice frozen water can be dangerous tell that to the people of Peru were twenty two thousand people were killed in an avalanche you're Nineteen Seventy to those people family\nSee this is why he's done on the Supreme Court look at look at his temperament you don't have the temperament to be anywhere near that microphone\nMr ... I Do have the um the temperament to be on the ... a team however all you know and of course I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that\nThey spent Glenn fifth teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how he look it's it's certainly on its own this is their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court said for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWhat but what it does say when it does is it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his\nAnger when he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I Know what I'm saying even reached further I Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like\nThe anger I Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with that ... thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people so no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here's my clean to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime was an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would\nHave done it no other president in my lifetime would have stuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\n\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they are going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWith that being said and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those those charges turned out to be right you notice you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in like she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out and this FBI there they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury you watch that's by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say\nYou know he he you know quit or vote went down all went down in ... down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the old in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't need how long did they do take to do to the ... sessions\nAh ah ah I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighty was the vote went down so let it for weeks and three or four weeks for an hour we could have probably could have fast read other things going on um case so you have four\nWeeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks\nThe one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nIt's already been done he's the only under get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael he's the only senator on the list ts so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select him\nLet's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow [laughter] which car wouldn't\nStrange accident but it could happen and it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and one of them are the guy who they were fighting on the ... yeah I mean was turning on it\nThat happens to Kevin well this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane they'll be delivering ah [noise] the New York times are playing but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes them into sausage ... uh\nYou need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is\n... ... pro life uh and he would vote\nA ... the bottom line is he cares about the constitution that anything I mean you will vote he will\nWell the constitution and he will also vote for right of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough here's Mike Lee\nThat could mean better interest rates on loans and credit card which can save you thousands of dollars in the long

preponderance of evidence if it you know the details matter but yes you're speaking yes okay a perjury this is what\nThey're going for now this is what Jeff Flake has bought and what he purchased a

it you're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yep no I'm not God today might be your attorney unless your God you\nDon't know that you cannot know that\nI mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me judge less you be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out if he\nWas perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves\nBut that requires evidence that requires\nSome sort of of case to be made not accusations\nBut a case to be made\nHere destroying a person's life see here's the problem with this particular professor at Georgetown\nShe's looking for social justice\nShe's looking for ... to ... uh to be righted somehow or another and it doesn't matter all men are guilty all men are guilty well I'm Sorry was gundy guilty was Gandhi guilty\nReally\n'cause he was a man was Martin Luther king was he guilty\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men uh it had been one was\nThe alleged for land or the other was it clear racist gundy I still think they were great men they were just flawed\n\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they\nAre collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors when you go down that road you always always end up killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying\nWe should feed their genitals to the pigs\n\nTell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric and what a surprise

monster is saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time\nThe media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so what's the best way\nTo get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you\nBecause I was so convinced I was right\n\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you were crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way\nAnd as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions\nBut what amazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish\nYou do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others please don't do that to others who say you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are at least making some sense please\nDo not rubbed their oh well we told you so or really remember when you don't do that please don't do that will come them\nIf we're going to heal the nation the first thing we have to do is peel the right we're going to heal the nation we have got to put our

about it and hear your thoughts where I might have missed it where what you may not understood\nUm you know what what do you think is crazy or what is good if you've read the book addicted outrage can we put this on for Thursday I'd like to hear from you Thursday on radio and we'll take calls on Thursday ... a ... just about the book\nYou know given people enough time to actually read it which is nice yeah I think he wanted to do this like the day after I did not everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for a week now and if\nYou've read it or let's talk about it on because there's all there's a ton a ton in there\nI I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like all the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this cap it off yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the entire effort of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and you'll see a lot of times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just doesn't make any sense and there's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basis of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories and the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah you can find it in the book addicted to outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh end of the the upper echelons\nOf politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe what they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal in their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy in the patriarchy and to collapse the system that we have\nAnd if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting a radically and there's some reason and you don't understand that why would they do this they blew their job why they do that they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just ...\nOh how and why this is going on but how to push back against it and how to defeat it yeah it\nIs not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight\nJust fight the right way just know who your enemy is the tactics\nThat they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading and try to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do\n'em and uh and then join us on a joined us

okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Capitol which again\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know she gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you that's up yard important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nGeneral general attorney general would raise a good one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up ... because there's a certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there is an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the capital case in the aisles the case\nOf the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort of between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend upkeep\nAlison has accused him of sexual abuse or ... violin okay oh okay that I got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\n... ... words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison teeth Allison's I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries ah um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might know it's a slight distinction between those two things one\nHas notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you\nThough using meeting me yeah and so she and you know and in one one one case you have a woman who has photos of the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being forward shift and have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course\nI'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening then people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborate is your story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um the pictures and are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real\nTime real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that Ford told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like who Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but but but lives and I mean
