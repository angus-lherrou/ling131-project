[noise] in fact\nGoing back program we need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to now ... we need it wouldn't make that a oatmeal soup that she made in ... found don't know maybe we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on\nThis whole thing because this is this is just outrageous\nDon't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and part Delaware yes\nAh which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee and then they revise that you won ...\n... ... the media revised that can they actually looked at the report says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve ... then they realized loops deep sea we made a a map there this is a serious correction been in the deep sea and the corruption but they pay they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one uh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in in of itself so he got\nThe human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right could at least give her a technical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's\nA you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her was stupid to super recipes and pow al ... which is the goal of almost everybody\nIn America how how how wild child and they don't want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's where I'm going all fall I'm going all full\nI'm but I'm just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of out both teams but let's let let ... how wild out already or from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans sense it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to ...\nThey just didn't show any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against we have to use people from\nPeru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well way\nAnd there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood that it's not even what they tested\nOr and even that it's it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years\nHe would not show the hit Canadian blood sites like that not only did they oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian and somewhat DNA does is it shows the lineage of game shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns and I wonder if he would it would have his blood\nWould show that he's a thousand times more Hispanic than\nA friend's disorder or [laughter] that's true it probably would show that\nUh but so it's interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was\nUm it was her great great great great\nGrandmother I think a several generations back and um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white now the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you\nWere not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that number one obviously why that is true we don't know that it's true with this person\nRight we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother ... secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself had identified as\nShe said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not that was what I really were not allowed to apply to any little we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have\nTo accept that she is so we can't accept which is what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter\nDoesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just ... I don't really care I don't care either\nBut I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face more than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got um you know we've got to start making them or I Want one more than life itself okay\nSo you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather actually took a horse or be a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else but\nHe took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so ... ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't app okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept a jumping over and we're getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this\nAnd he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I got to go out and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this\nIs what it was but it was the was it was not true how many advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls\nI was her I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told extra you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've\nYou've yeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things and that's why it is I can give you that I got what it's about as I give me then I got a huge story I mean you know we will you know\nWants to show their abortion nobody thinks that's a good idea except for the extremist and the and the revolutionaries and the Marxist and you know the the post modernist everybody else was like don't shout your abortion that's not something to be proud\nOf so you have this you have ... you have you know hating cops hating white hating men hating capitalism shutting down of free speech tape God\nPeople aren't some people are not into you know oh in third grade there's a transition party because all genders or fluid they're not into that and they've had enough of it\nAnd with Elizabeth Warren doing this whole I'm Native American\nNobody cares nobody cares if she is nobody cares if she isn't\nI mean what difference does it make and so ... by playing into it she's\nJust making about identity politics more and more and nobody cared enough people are done with the identity politics I'm telling you they're done with it and the the the first candidate and well we already know the first candidate was Donald Trump\nSaid I don't care I don't care\nI don't care what you say about me I don't care what you accuse me of I don't care that's why he won\nBecause he that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't want this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side\nThey're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else but they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we are going to get rid of capitalism gives it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers\nMan boy men are trouble especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really great I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because India\nShut up nobody cares\nWith all of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShut up the issue here is\nYou don't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activists who do believe all that craziness\nSo and there are so they're stopped their hardware incentivize right who when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the Kavanaugh saying as white ... he's on TV with you know with the crazy crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate\nYou're not going to be able to moderate but those people\nHow do you moderate how do you go over to the side of ... and say hey I don't think anybody is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nCome back close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean to shout the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean ... cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nYou're you've been eaten you've been eaten\nBy the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not out shouting their abortion\nStay informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI Mm\nNews I'm Carmen Robert this offends whether or not they came with the crown prince knew about it if they knew about it that would be bad\nSale President Trump says the world is rushing to judgment when it comes to whether the Saudis murdered journalist ... ...

Shapiro\nYeah um and he came out and and spoke about your past with alcohol [noise] and ah outlet you add to enter a and I talk to you and struggling with alcohol myself\nI'm and I'm being drunk when I watched that video [noise] um and I I stopped island you know this\nThis man with all the stress that he goes through a he's he's managed to overcome this problem and become a better person and really I've seen a good change in your personality I'm you've become much more humble and so\nBecause of your inspiration I decided to step out and go to AA myself and uh it's been a huge help\nCollusion value\nWhen did you go to a when did you just start about three weeks ago and you're still you're still sober Oh absolutely yes having a great time out all\nRelieved that wasn't my experience but good for you good for you know [laughter] so ah so ... what was it that was set in that that that turned you\n\nKnow it was um [noise] we're talking about the ... it was funny yeah of course it was it was really impacting ... D so honest I mean it's it's got to be tough being in the public eye or something so personal and that that really hit me like a ton of bricks and um\nAnd then you are talking about the uh the the lady in your in your group that\nSaid oh honey where all wrong in this room and I I you\nKnow I've always seen a meetings as probably something lame or or people that wouldn't understand me or anything like that and that was the one moment that really turned my attitude and made me go I can walk in the door like and do this and I'll be in good company and I I found out to be true\nBut I tell you will um ... meeting is different it just depends on where you are and if you do find one that you relate to go find another one\nBecause they are wildly wildly different walked into a a meeting in midtown Manhattan and uh you know I had a hard time relating to people because they literally were in the gutter and just coming out and I never experienced that and so it was it was different for me\nUm but you'll you'll find that people you relate to I'm so happy for you did did people in your life you know that you're having a problem will [noise]\nUh yes you know my my problems had been I'm a pretty obvious for a long time I've I've struggled with alcohol for uh almost Twenty years [noise] and ah I first I first got drunk when I was Fifteen I I've always struggled from South\nOn science issues which is kind of the under current that has helped me [noise] and um when I was around Nineteen I was in a terrible relationship and had a bad breakup and and got into alcohol to kind of cope with it and try and get over it and get over the emotions and I'm\n... I made a terrible drunk decision and kind of retaliation I committed a crime and um my parents helped me through that time out in the counseling got me things that I needed [noise] but um\nWith their self confidence issues I I had a lot of self hatred that came from committing a crime and are coming out of that I was drunk or every day for about seven years you know and I held my life together I I Would sober up to go to work\nI Would come home and just get tanked and start all over again and then I'm back in um here's two thousand eight I had a terrible accident I was drunk again uh messing around with fireworks ... up from Wyoming and lost a fifty percent on my left hand\nOh my gosh and\nI didn't have a job or up\nI soak it up for four years and I got married a got a took on three step kids and walk into a different life rebuild my relationship with God and I came to a point of stress says comes in marriage and um sell off the wagon\nSeeing people tear it down but nobody who's talking about is it worth saving so how do we answer that question\nThan the book goes through that and I I think the road to recovery of of our ills in this nation start there\nOr you know you can say Hillary Clinton can say well I Can't compromise with people you know I Can't even talk to those people because they want to destroy everything I Believe in what what is that you believe in\nAnd and really believe in don't tell me the ... little things tell me about America tell me who you are now\nShe can't do that because I don't I just don't think that she's a she's honest enough\nTo tell me she's this is a politician sees a calculating and and so are most politicians right and left it's up to us we have to say that to our neighbors that we think we disagree with can we just can we not talk about politics for a second\nIs America worth saving is it a good place or a bad place and the book shows you how to have that conversation and gives you some some facts both on good and bad\nBecause both sides have to have to step to the plate both sides Republicans generally see rah rah all of the good things red white and blue and were patriotic because we believe and we don't want to hear the bad things because usually the bad things are being told to us by people who have the country\nWe have to go out and learn the bad things about the country and those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nI don't know about you but I'm both good and bad and my struggle every day is to be more good than bad to be a little better than I was yesterday and if I let myself go I'll be a bad guy well we've let ourselves go we're not trying to balance that anymore\nWe're saying we want to save this well why why what's worth saving what is it what are we saving and can you save quote the free market system [noise] by violating the free market system the answer to that is no\nSo what is it worth saving and is it worth saving and once we decide on that we'll know the path forward\n[laughter]\n\nWant to thank our sponsor this half hour it's a ex chair just bought a new chairs for the studio um\nAnd it's the

in some extra kicks right and so that's maybe five seconds of violence that wouldn't have happened if they went your way\nThat's five seconds out of three days of terror ah and she was with threats anger venue they were giving death threat to this old lady who answered the own their\nHang on hang on a start but let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what [laughter] that and you have to hit the poster because uh [laughter]\nI think the poster is just to be entertaining but go ahead well I\nTry it again I'm a coup she killed a socialist where the samurai sword in Nineteen sixty and it's a funny trolls that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the Pinochet thing where he writes the helicopter rides for comedy is\nReally really fat tire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesdays call myself a toy again like Gabby and I photoshopped myself into his mug shot 'em this second we announced that and anyone who knows me to know is that a satire\nAntifa goes all the blast they start attacking the venue attacking the lady there the calls are coming from all over the country by the way so this is a planned attack that anti for his work I think the and the and they had people working hand in hand traditional as well organized and well funded\nSo then that those attacks continue night before the venue totally trash windows smashed ridiculously pretentious manifesto nailed to the door that says that we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA and then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos you're just we made signed screaming hurling bottles of urine which one of them hit my car on the way out\nA ... ... organized rallies like there's this guy I met said you'll see if you really get deeper into the foxhole where he is calling in the front thing you know you guys go over there over there I citizen journalists get beat up they take his backpack their police to arrest him and then\nI I mean they they arrest the citizen journalist\n... known outside interests three of the of the end who mob this guy okay but I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks it seemed very military so this isn't anarchy these anarchist are calling us\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are um and to FAA Austin is a on their Facebook page\nHas called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a\nWhat do they call it a black shirt army or something I read a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for people that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening and of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\nI must be the Mets had guy the police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about 'em so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther King I'm up there I saw the same experience right up till now and it's been days\nAnd then when it's time to leave I come out there I've got my plastic\nSword I make a choice which new joke and that's when they heard on the Internet may I jump in the car\nAnd then a group of Proud Boys are are the last ones to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter\nThey're attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and the huge fight breaks out and now in your world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nAnd then I'll come actual it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no gender NO PLAN and it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon and uh you know Portland has I I don't know who this mayor is what I mean\nWhat the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away and they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with these super laughing towns like Berkeley in Portland is the mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say\nSorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos that happens when someone who likes Trump shows up when when Republicans and conservatives are around so well that's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping huh\nThat's their sort of a mile and it works\nIt's interesting because it because the initial video seemed to indicate that you guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from ... throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\n[noise] and it's strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative which out doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media takes up five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days or some subterfuge stays in the domestic violence so almost I I'm an I'm at a point now I think they don't just like ... but\nThey are antifa I think a lot of these journalists these little hostile bloggers will go to rallies if masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I uh I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have tried\nTo be more moderating uh on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick 'em when they're down in all of this stuff are you there is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole\nA mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants\nTucker Carlson just today said he can't go to restaurants and no known conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one and it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist\nLike it it means absolutely nothing all white supremacist someone who sees white people as above all other races just inherently better and wants all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly esoteric\nView to have it's it's a crazy if you to have and they just throw it on it and it sticks like glue\nAnd it affects our families affects our lives affects our personal lives there's gotta be some culpability there\nOkay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to own a take you over across the break in and just\nAsk you what it is you believe what is the America then you see and that you are fighting for [noise] back was Gavin begin is coming up and just a second let me tell you a little bit about gold lying\nIf you think this stuff is going away quickly it's not a if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress\nWe are in we're in for a real wild ride um they are going to subpoena the tax records\nAnd when they don't get the tax records from the White House the White House will bring it to the Supreme Court and then the uh Democrats will say the Supreme Court doesn't

and they'll impeach ... Donald Trump I mean it's\nThis what's happening this is what's happening these people are playing for keeps and they are not paying attention to things like oh I don't know the economy isn't as any really heard you know I see the tweets from Donald Trump all the time I see all the stuff they're saying about Donald Trump has anybody really heard\nWhat's going on with the stock market\nDoes anybody really paying attention to what's happening with Saudi Arabia that's a pretty big deal especially when you look at the price of oil a anybody pay attention that nope not in the media gold mine is put together a um\nKFYI Mm\n[noise]\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert secretary said my mom bales on his way from Saudi Arabia to turkey has he always apply diplomatic pressure to find out what happened a journalist Jamal cause Yogi\nThe question now is just how hard would President Trump will be willing to punish them out if if they are indeed response of all President Trump prove that he was perfectly capable to punish turkey for if you're paying ... uh the American pastor Andrew Brunson\nScientists and Fisher catastrophic flooding collapse as a bridge in central Texas longtime residents in Atlanta say they'd never seen a lot of the time\nIt is nearly ... graves asked him waves all Muslims St Vincent's ... not ...\nJacqueline Pakistan with Fox seven in Austin and that got millions drawing for winning numbers that jackpot six hundred and sixty seven million dollars the third largest in us history [laughter] this is talk [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening in ... [noise]\nYou know in the in the book addicted outrage I [noise] I\n... some people who haven't read the book I think that it is about um a surrendering or or just making friends with the left and it's done that's not what this is about at all\nIt's about knowing what you believe and then taking a strong stand but with a different approach because times have changed\nAnd um and they're getting more and more dangerous and\nI have talked to you about Martin Luther king for a long time or or somebody who wrote a read my book who [noise] um I really respect they they read it and they said\nA year about a year to a head I'm not sure um maybe\nMaybe because I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and crazier maybe\nBut it's not about it's not about reuniting with the left because I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in Washington I'm not talking about political people and talk about your neighbors but the first thing we have to do is unite\nWith each other we have to unite to people people who are or on the right part of the spectrum need to come together we have to come together\nAnd I'm I'm really I I'm I don't like the hey you're on the train or you're not on the train but he talking about what train where's the train going\nHere's the train that we should all be on\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place people die\nIn the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out if you work hard you're smart and you're a little bit lucky you can break out\nYou can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates that's America that's great\nThat's why people come here and we're losing sight of that until the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving and I think the answer across the board I'll bet you eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving\nSo what does that mean well capitalism capitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution but we haven't been on the constitution or the bill of rights in a long time but we do need a rule of law\nLet me start asking you know just a few questions and I don't care who he voted for I don't care what side of the aisle you're on just answer yes or no\nDo you hate men\nDo you hate white people do you hate black people do you hate Jews do you hate cops do you hate capitalism\nDo you want to shout down others that have a different opinion\n\nDo you want to shout down God or hate God\n\nDo you believe street violence is the way we solve things in America\nIf you answered yes to any of those things I don't think I have much in common with you but I don't care who you voted for I'll bet you the vast majority said no to all of those things and it wasn't a hard well I don't know it was no no no no no no no no\nThat's who we are\nThose are the people you need we need to unite with but the easy ones to get by the ones on our own side getting the Guinness and I\nMay disagree on a lot of things we disagree I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and walk through ...\nSinging hymns and let them club you in the head go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks

[noise] ... if the Klan that probably and those who can you help me war game this abandoning talking about this Saudi Arabia thing because right now Congress is saying we want to slap major sanctions on\nThem okay I'm you know where we're at a point to where uh I said you know back in the early to thousands you're going to get to a point where if you haven't dealt with these problems it's going to be too late and there isn't going to be a single good option you are not going to like the options\nAnd so right now you have people saying yeah ours is gone we're just we're not going to sell them the arms more got slapped sanctions on they admit this this is horrible and it is it is and that's probably what America should do\nHowever let me play devil's advocate oil is already up at eighty\nSome some ah oil is headed up to a hundred dollars a barrel we've pretty much shut down the Texas oil reserves were I mean we're slowing them down because of the price of oil they couldn't make enough money so they kind of slow them down and we have to open those things back up again which we can do\nBut we're not held hostage by oil but a a spike as severe spike a hundred twenty hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's what collapsed us last time in two thousand eight\nWas a spike to a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you also have turkey\nThis is coming from turkey and ... um turkey is no fan of Saudi Arabia um the balance of power with turkey is a little frightening economically the Saudi royal uh funds are\nBig in Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons why our stock market is taking a hit at least in the tech sector\nBecause they think if this goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where they're going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that that you know can hurt the industry you also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check\nOn um uh on Iran if they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor in that\nI mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan there's others that are that I Would say are better options but would that amount of power us and uh you know again credibility in the Arab world obviously Israel\nDoesn't necessarily have that um but you know Saudi Arabia you know\nIs a is the big a sort of backstop right so what do we do they can stop the worst of the things that are as an ear presidents presidents do\nWhat do you do today I uh [laughter]\nUh resigned [laughter] I Know uh I I think um\nYou have to figure first of all we need I Would certainly the first thing I Would do is have more information that I currently do um so I\nThink you're over there with the king and the king says she's screw up total screw up this guy who they were out of control you know I wanted and brought over here they got out of control they started torturing him for answers he died\nAnd then they just chopped them up put them in a suitcase yes all of that stuff is true and I can't believe these guys they've all they're already dead [laughter]\nOr whatever or you know but yes we\nDid it ... I mean I think you at the very least they're going to do something\nPublic right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nOr and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then I remember\nThere was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here\nIs that uh they believe that he was um you know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against\nSaudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist this that let's let's let's clear that up the Susan ...
