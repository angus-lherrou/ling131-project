they're calling the bottom of course the and that's all over this is Bob Bob Bob\nIt's just crazy potentially destructive devices that's all they're all none of them went off no one got hurt but he is a terrorist I'm saying that yes he's ... years I'm saying he sees or say gets to truly this was all about him of course they're talking about Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump spots all\nHe did this because of Trump's rhetoric as if he received a letter from the president himself with marching orders to go do this nonsense he did not a ... and I said before and I think it's important to note that if anything it's cited this\nAre false\nBut also the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time it's not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one\nPresident Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to say anything about it\nThe crazy thing is today the\nCraziest thing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was weapon I think the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt forget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is\nCalling us fake news yeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in Chapel Hill\nHe was what ... the government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\nThere's the media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake\nThe New York times\nWas publishing an article on the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this or you just want you to just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta\nAnd while this is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled\nFive novelist imagine Trump's next chapter five novel lists imagined Trump's next chapter\nThe main image at the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye each novelist had one assignment\nRight out what you think happens after the bowler investigation is completed okay [laughter] so let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen\nWith Mueller's investigation and what's gonna happen immediately after\nHe'll mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come as a surprise they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not\nGuilty it's crazy one\nStory had Trump signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him uh being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence which what do you what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's about a cool this\nIs the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is ... oh my gosh I mean we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed\nBy the secret service this is unbelievable how\nIs it the two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American media is writing this bull crap while the pipe bombs are coming in\nThis this time space exhibit a\nFor why journalism is currently dead in America it is dead in America all of you dancing on the grave of Megan Kelly really what was her what was her big thin she asked a question that\nOh my gosh lock her in a tower\nOh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public you can ask a question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact finding\nIs gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will chase you out of the public square they have knowing\nInclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\n\nYes there is a little righteous indignation and maybe it's not anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people\nI have gone to them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need to understand how half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these airs oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now they're quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and the New York times journalist I don't know\nMedia\n[noise] this is a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radicals\nYou you feel like there's nothing wrong with being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBut here's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[laughter]\nFriday over twenty thicker and back program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this person in the media in particular Glen or maybe this one what is the one thing that if you're a conservative truck makes the ACA criticisms of the media they say\nHey it's fake news hey these guys are lying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that famous violence\nLike you're you're you're you're creating ... coming after I was writing I Can't go there yet I Can't I Can't I got to take a break I Can't go there yet\nI Can't I Know where you're going and boy does it need to be said I Can't do it yet and\nI can do you need to do you mean like I just not safe crank that was that we are now I think that's it again I'd been telling you for years and get to your alcohol if we can reignite that it's going to be a good ratings most time can I tell you something the blackouts I Need the blackout right now I Need them so desperate alright it would be so great\nI forgot about everything that they said that was so stupid yesterday [laughter]\nI don't even recall it at all I Love that idea\nExplosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonating almost like a Wylie coyote kind of bomb almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the ... of feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension ah but I'm Sorry in real life I'm ... in fact\nThe fact they go on the New York times in fact bomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clock their devices really keep\nFrom tipping off they're targeting no about when the bombs are said to explain it was just a like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I thought oh look at that and you're like that's not a bomb here's a here's a bonus if you survive\nThey all it is that it got an alarm you don't want one hundred percent survive ability so far on these bombs one\nHundred percent survive ability we're\nIs weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay\nSomeone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they wanted to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually want to kill they want to do that if they pull\nYou want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong wholly horror despicable and everyone they weren't murderers\nAnd so they built this to look like bomb if you look on I mean you get this example of this on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far in that they don't actually intend to do it they don't intend on a you know he thought that that happened to for example Dana lash right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often and and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would\nUh execute a terrorist attack on on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I said it\nIs so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens\nHowever obviously they're not doing it right whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether there are in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election uh sending me things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a ... big media circus if things are all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work and they're really all that's all the information we have right now\nWell but I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the rice dog fire and um I don't know about you but I think the Germans behaved admirably I think the Germans did exactly how to do with you on that one no this\nIs the rice dog then communist did that bright grand\nDe informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI ...\n[noise]\nMosques News I'm ... these are not hoax devices\nThe director Christopher Wray says

and yeah but I'm from what network though I'm a little over there\nThere was an NBA you see all those India and the NBC that end up paying that were really worked for ... dress up as blackmail no no it it might be okay for Halloween if you are not\nMaking fun of someone right so she wasn't making fun\nOf well he was he was kind of making fun of Chris Hughes imitating ... a ... you know it's even more ... than that though and it's it's [noise] it's despicable that we have to play this game and it it's okay for all of them are the Jimmy Kimmel thing with good oh ha imitating Carl Malone\nDo we

blackface just talking that way it would be our last day\n... yeah I mean we talked a of a couple of different examples of blackface are being used in comedy very recently like in those Sunday in Philadelphia was one of the examples he brought up\nAnd it's an insult was sending in Philadelphia they did it and they did it as for a minute they're making a point right like that only be more on ... characters on this show would think that that's an appropriate thing this gimme came of it is just saying hey I'm black and I'm Carl Malone it just him mocking a black person\nYeah a mind the way

other part of the basic yeah and even black face right my bedroom so unbelievable getting\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon one worked as can be found is not a political enemies and Kimmel has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him\nBut Fallon who is I think there's no ill intent by Jimmy Fallon doing that but he's friends with Chris Rock rain but the issue here is it on the freaking NBC yeah\nYou can also wire legally for mentioning it but you're ... you're going to give Jimmy found the top but place in your network so what\nShe said was weight

and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one\nSo Donald Trump could have done that easy\nBut he chose to fight back trumped it and he said I'm not going to let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter they see me as a person who strikes back when attacks so while I'm going to do that\nSo then you have to say okay well who started the fracas\nWho started this and you can make a case said Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow how he's he's his own people names yeah he's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your feeling be and kick to death\nBy being called racist and homophobia and everything else came later\nWhen it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win see what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like\nEntertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear that's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed\nAnd it I I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does\nOkay so then it was destroy him destroy ... that that would be orders that came down\nFrom the editors who the New York times not in those words\nBut it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nAnd like Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump counter what does he do\nHe doesn't have surrogates I mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it\nSo he does it in a very ...\nAnd sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice what if he doesn't do it\nThey are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah and the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that\nBut he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights back but now they're turning it around saying well your\nYour fight back Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if that fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on your ear being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN and we're not responsible for any of it or not us now I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people\nUnderstand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh [noise]\nHow much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five in the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody\nThis was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us\nFrom the jump of course they're cartoon bombs they are the only thing it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this ... this was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy\nCould be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really unbelievably worse the bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt\nIt could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press and needs to all of the all of the enemies of the right or we'll obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence with midterms I'm putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do you do and how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that was why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flesh this out pretty quickly\n... how would the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out or the or Washington DC think tanks progressive think tanks bass and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff so that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this uh may be the person sending it was insane ah you know that kinda thing they'll never say\nWell gee maybe um our side is so craves now that we have to criticize our side you're never going to see that

happening with the economy read this report I've read it I've already shared it you need to get it to its free all you have to do is call gold line right now and ask them for their\nWhat you think the

applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out that I wasn't able to walk the man and looked at his own set for an army and his hand and repeatedly

it it I mean if they have their own show they can make that point I suppose\nWasn't the guy wasn't the guy in Virginia [laughter] so if you disagree with is get your own show uh the guy in Virginia didn't he have a van to I thought he was living in his van or something wasn't even\nYeah it's I think you're right yes he was because he went to um he did he would be that the YMCA the local YMCA so when the shooting happened they knew where he was and they knew who he was because he was very he he was lifted in another state and drove there should basically camped out there\nAnd prepare for the shooting right\nWhen he was a Bernie Sanders guy a big big big big big big big big big crazy big Bernie Sanders guy and he was living in his man\nI mean it's going to be interesting to see I think there's several distinctions to several additional levels to this let's say we find out that this is exactly what is it is the person it is has banned these are pro Trump stickers whatever I mean we don't know any of those things for sure yet uh but if we find that out to be an interesting distinction to see if he is the ... he's either a very incompetent\nLunatic who tried to blow up people and failed or hold on I Want more than ... ... or ... he's a a lunatic who ah was just try to scare\nPeople did not intend to kill people that will be an ... a distinction that will be interesting in the

phone my bag because I Want people to know and maybe it'll change their heart maybe it'll change their mind that bans not that bad it's not that that ban is like a\n... stay away from this guy ... let me ask you this yeah in in American history looking for in global history\nIn global has has there ever been an individual who has been won over by a massive collection of bumper stickers on a car has anyone ever changed in opinion are considered a new one because someone not from one bumper sticker 'cause I think that's even possible\nBut maybe even a ... maybe not due to write three you're pushing it you have three hundred bumper stickers covering all of your windows you are not convincing anyone to your viewpoint I think you know people because of it\nOh no if you have a nature way you're you're you're going to be kicked out yeah you're going to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof to death all of the neighbors even the name you could\nBe living in the most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood with the holy family and the pope and all of the pro life activists from all time\nRight and you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we have standards yeah you're nuts\nI just really hope if Jesus comes back he's not in the van [laughter] you know when it comes in a white van with you about your bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just like I don't believe this guy there's no way back like that and again you're not supposed\nTo know what's coming right or maybe that's how he does how does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes with that I Would you do [laughter] well no no no because I wouldn't be slick enough he would have you know he'd be\nAnd sometimes patients will say like a migraine I get these horrible migraines um and I don't really like to correct patients when we first meet but I'm a lotta times it's not a migraine these these these tension headaches gets so bad that they actually will mimic a migraine and migraine literally means half of your head\nAnd so if it's half of your head well that's technically a migraine um however most of the migraines are caused by a vascular you have a quick diesel dial leash and so the blood vessels are rapidly opening\nThen they constrict quickly will look controls\nThe ... of constriction well that's another directly control of our nervous system so how can by adjusting or someone's neck helpless or a bad migraine well that's controlling the blood flow\nSo you're directly affecting the body's ability to normalize itself and so it starts to work correctly\nSo also consequently when when you're dealing with headaches it's not always just one cause so some patients will have um they'll have a headache will adjust them bloom feel so much better headache goes away\nAnd then they come back the next day like man headache went away for a couple of hours and it came right back well they were saying okay well there there might be something more involved and and just the neck\nCan also have um a T. M. J. issue so we all have a T. M. J. but\nNot everybody has T. M. J. D. so T. M. J. D. can also cause headaches I Believe we have um a caller on the lines ... J good afternoon\nYes Hi there thank you interesting program thank you [noise] [noise] yeah I'm healthy with\nYeah I'm a\nDealing with a lower back issue um I in my I have a history of lower like I'm\nAll for injury from many many years ago um work related and I I kind of worked out of that ... and I ended up just getting periodic\nMaintenance on that hard chiropractic and and ... and excess Foley injury he'll you know you X rays a disc injury and um\nAnd so I started having here a few months ago ... and they gave me an extra exercise sitting in a in a flat chair with your knees square in front of you in on the floor and you do this uh above the shoulder um\nElbows up in arms arms and I was up to rotate and it said to relieve some of that a pension or or irrigation on the lower spine yep\nAnd and it works really well I mean I've gone to that [noise] more times than I can count a over the years Shannon few\nCouple of days or that you know and it and it clears up against that but what I have now is it feels like the same type of thing with some pitching on the static on my right leg but that type of an exercise doesn't have any influence on something that feels different but the symptoms feel similar\nUm and so I I was I did have um a a person who I Know did he ... journey to have a little\n... I mean he thinks that the sec really actor aside joint you know a issue\nMhm now and um\nAnd I I Wonder in when you said someone just a few minutes to go there you tied in something with a a ... like the knees or somehow tied into the F ... joint you know and she and I didn't\nTie that together but I was I was wondering about that when you said that uh there and and I thought wow I'm\nI Need to find out because my right knee it seemed like almost the same time my right knee was sore which uh I I don't recall having had an issue of that ever in the past mhm uh nothing sustained anyway\nYeah if it so uh how how is that connected\nAnd that that's something um well I I was wondering if I give you the full picture I was wondering if\nJust using an s I built a for support is that something had be worth trying or is this something that needs to have some spinal care manipulation\nBut I think the the answer would be both um you know if you look at 'em\nNo intent plug on on Home Depot but if you went there you know a few years ago you see all the employees they all had back races on right and you go there now they don't wear ... races will they found that people who were the ... races they were having more injuries\nThan hot wearing a back race so if you have an acute back problem that you just can't really function than a back brace is is not a bad idea for a short term a long term use is going to relax those muscles can relax\nThe course or really can't do its job I'm All right so if if you're also associate with the need you got to figure out if it's the F\n... joint I'm causing a short leg that that is putting more stress on that any but then if you go up a couple of segments to else three the three nerve route goes to the knee so it could be two things possibly causing that that knee problem so\nThey are tied together\nYeah ... ... ... I mean it could be your ankle too so it's um again if you just look at that one spot you're going to be missing a lot and then really figuring out what's causing the problem so you know go back to your chiropractor you know my clinics in Peoria you can call the six to three\nEight seven eight eight to zero zero in law lives will pick up and she can get you said and we can we can evaluate you and\nWhat's yeah ah this other fellow is a long ways out and uh I don't have time to go back to them but okay um\n'cause he he does a whole bunch of different stuff too and it would just like showing the [noise] the whole sink at you and I just couldn't really relate to it all\n[laughter] sometimes you throw too much I Do not sure what's going to stick and what actually works so right you do see a couple of things that yeah\nAnd it got to be pretty costly you know and you know doing it that way so I'm more conservative you know this this type of thing I had good access to chiropractors over the year and I I I I trust some I'm a good one yeah I'm ... what is your clinics number again ...\nWhere it's Mitchell chiropractic rough of lake pleasant happy valley in our phone number is six to three eight seven eight eight to zero zero\nOkay and there I'm assuming they're no not open today\nOh you can call we're not open no but you can call someone will we have a we have a cell phone that it'll go too so you can you can talk to live oh\nOkay I think slightly wage yeah our it'll shut it down to the information I have a great day you too thank you bye\nOkay so uh that was great Jay thank you so much for calling in I'm as you're finding out that the lower back and um it can affect the knee as well so we we were briefly talking about headaches and and the great effectiveness of chiropractic care and again\n... we we don't use drugs we don't use surgery\nWe use our hands to adjust we take pressure off nerves we'll all the body to work correctly consequently a lot of patients that have headaches or as they get older too they may also have high blood pressure we were um I was at a seminar this past weekend is actually by medical doctor and it was all chiropractors and medical doctor saying\nWhat's the best treatment for high blood pressure\nAnd it's kind of crickets and it's like well chiropractic there's many research studies going pub empty or Web MD and you'll see the chiropractor people people who are adjusted um their blood pressure normalize is the second best way to help heart disease and high blood pressure is meditation and relaxation so I'm In my clinic\nIs in Peoria, Arizona six to three eight Seventy eight to zero zero thank you for spending some of your time with me today and time to go outside and get some exercise enjoy some sunshine thank you very much I've read in\nThe proceeding has been to the program I learned real we know the car wrecks don't take the weekends off and neither do we have you been in a car wreck or over the weekend you don't have to see to Phoenix and I are radio station [noise]\nHeartbreak in Pittsburgh I'm ... in the morning has begun in Pittsburgh after eleven people lost their lives when a man's spewing anti Semitic comments open fire to synagogue six other people were injured including for police officers the suspect to under us\nA better mouse trap or app or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about\nPolitics but at\nWhat point do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi in California than hundred centigrade weirdos did to Mitch McConnell Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly latter day\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest that clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off their table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually\nHave persuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and is standing you know Martin Luther king marching through\nAtlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... a a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of ... restored downtown and Omaha right now and there's no end to fight\nHere and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans\nAny given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was\nShared content and there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics or you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book\nThem is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like and to her do who are doing this to hope\nFor viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignored them [noise]\nSo what he is are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years in the things that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... a a pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech\nRight of protest all of those things flow from the fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe muggy day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with\nDignity that way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests and statistically the number one driver of happiness is\nDo you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness\nBut we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this\nAh and you're

and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions\nAbout geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so

five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere in McDonalds right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ... pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues\nBut that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be
