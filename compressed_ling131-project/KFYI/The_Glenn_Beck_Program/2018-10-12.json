can be about ... the national anthem\nThat can be about something that a celebrity status and an amplified sort of turned up to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this this incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that's by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or ... pop it accounts\nYou were talking about a a moving target people who are deleting they're out changing their information making new accounts\nStaying active so that they can't actually be attracted to it and given location and if Morton ... researcher at us he could prove definitively that these are Russian agents than he should be working at the CIA but he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned is what behaviors do they engage in debate speak in all caps what words they use and then as they are out there the next week when you look them up again these are sort of\nThings that you look for when you're talking about foreign influence on line and that might be Russian that might be the Chinese it might be Iranians or it might be some Floridian with a bone to pick with the rest of the country\nBut that so what did they landed limit what did they plant into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen account that could specifically be rushing linked\nA hundred and five that sort of had a question mark as to where they could be originating from

that there was a droid enough I remember those\nYeah and and so but the important thing blended that that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did that did the Russian you know ... or ... online plant the spot in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like you know progressive fingers in the pot but there's also that discourse on line that happens where you sort of amplify

are we talking about post modernism how does it relate to my life\nThis I Believe is critical in it too if you don't understand this release to have a basic handle on it you don't know what you're fighting you don't know what's really happening you don't know who's behind a lot of his or what the series are behind it\nUm so let me let me first say post modernism the modern world is the world that\nWas created that chased out the dark ages it was the it's the world created by the enlightenment of of science and reason period the empirical evidence or and and even I mean to you when you hear people say mathematics is racist\nThis is because we're there\nTrying to deconstruct anything that holds the modern world together is that correct\nYes that they they think that it has been constructed\nOn family that a lot of places has been left out and this relates somehow toilet technology to side I think they had the problem with the idea that then irrational and I'm In ... and you know nature is that the property of winning or ran at white people\nYeah that that is that is how it works\nOK I'm going to take you before we move forward or I Want to take you back one more a step\nI'm a I'm going to take a break and then we come back the I'm like you to help me on this because it's my understanding that uh dared on fur coat came over\nTo the United states that this was really kind of shaped in frustration from the Nineteen sixty eight Paris a riots\nAnd in frustration that they're not going to be able to take this whole thing down unless they take it all down they got to take all the system's down they're not gonna win through culture um and then it was that it was actually much more strategic in its\nI'm planting a virus if you will and I'd love to hear your take on that if that's true or not when we come back we're with Helen roads [noise]\nFeel this way you know with political correctness or you know I go back to handy capable you know nobody wanted to see if that really hurt somebody's feelings that that you know nobody wants to do that are very few people want to do that\nYou know it it does kind of say well the next generation is going to adjust to sue you know just going to attach the same meanings behind Andy capable is handicapped but you know so it's a little worthless over a long period of time\nBut I don't think anybody I think generally speaking people are fair what this has turned into is a oppression\nYes I mean I I think that's something that we have to hold on to say because when life we accept that everybody can many kinds of the fact is cut Gemini trying to be good\nAnd and to do good for that the scientists and they actually care that they find that human beings\nThen yes we have a situation where the majority of the U.S still very much\nIn line wave London principles and all\nOf the ... right and we have to understand that a lot of the people who have taken on any intent light that none of the ... last night there is\nA side at trying to do good and trying to be sad that what we have to look at how this is ... in practice that we are seeing a right thing and\nAlso it's Harry and his and play and they tell us having anything from the from the activity going on these ideas which has come out as as the series\nI Believe that the eighth floor of\nThe population that it is drawing in more than what\nThey what kind of like it because the idea of a good the idea that that will mean April and they should\nHave the same like everybody else is on the line and they think the good as not to think of any should they have to think what will how\nBad can it be if they had the thing is\nProbably because they didn't they pay you may have actual payment and liberal ... take us away from the paper that we made in that film people and it's\nLike ... and an equal pay for women that they can write they should have got to the extent you know I think it's really\nSomething quite different [noise]\nSo I I I Want to continue our conversation I'm On this and the and the notion that beer beer it's a race to the bottom use with the inner sexuality you are you're flipping the pyramid just upside down but it is still a pyramid um where the the one who\nHas a the most uh the you know points you know I guess\nIn their favor of I've been abused with this this and this and buy these groups in this group and this group that they become the power\nUm it it sounds like it's it's just not just the construction is constructing something that is the ... in nature uh and I want to go there and I also need to find out a little bit about the hoaxes\nThat Helen and\nTo other scientists did who were just they were looking at these peer reviewed publications and saying\nThey don't even make

of our tradition but we shouldn't be paying for it um and the multiculturalism that has made it\nA racist to even say yeah I'm proud to be be English or I'm proud to be American I think\nThat is being taken as racist where I don't think it's meant as racist by the vast majority of people they're just proud of who they are and where they came from\nWell I I I certainly agree with that I I don't see the problem as as multiculturalism itself I and I'm In London and then and we can do quite well with this faith then yeah the the different ... that a great range of a different culture that\nWill

of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Chevy Cruze going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nMay you know basketball yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point I'm of a several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nNew York times doing something really really interesting in which\nYou know normally you kind of see the ... news well I didn't do that they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happens and then you score after winning right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the results that in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho was voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh it's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I at one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll\nThey had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls and had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is for a tend to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is a is part of that and why it's hard to read\nYou know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but Cruz in that\nPoll wound up up a nine point in that one he seemed to be honest when their eyes open up a lead there again and I'm not surprised by it either about a surprise that will get into all the details coming up

hundred was up a you know well over twelve hundred points higher than that a week ago\nUh I like to buy these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high employment I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still high on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWell good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike\nA and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise then bonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those facts of of ah fat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we used our she real signs of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to that says\nTo the fed and and uh John John Powell lying you take in a punch bowl away from this party just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think that he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that\nThat job is to squash shows a stock market rally\nAnd pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation do believe we should watch her guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax breaks and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have\nTo admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we have international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't that search I Am a little concerned by the way out of climate about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like a club on a four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why has it gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon sooner you they're not ... yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just said\nOkay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean of ... and the price because people are really concerned about the um [noise] you know about the price\nOf the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf our ... bring Texans Baca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin\nI've never seen anything like it plan I mean everywhere you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next year or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again\nSo [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know that's the stock market is driven by fear and greed [laughter] that's at Troy is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred\nI said to my wife honey let's let's take some of these profits and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale\nBut the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and we had Nineteen percent interest rates shortly after that until you stop talking about the fed when other\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a a you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the president as his chief executive officer of the country right\nIs no more and when you look at what's happened and you look at the\nDemocrats saying the things that they're saying now that you know Eric Eric Holder\nToday the latest is you know when they go low we ...
