I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist\nWasn't any or he's written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness what's going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean an important that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it for nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory\nAbout how the bushes knew this guy like they've got to go all out of it and they're working\nWith this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven um right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about\nThe business our allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to\nThe FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a friendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Obama was plenty friendly with them too\nExactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there is no way the\nBronco Obama would've done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point\nNo longer and it wouldn't have done anything about this to a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is as Pence of right and they were never good I'm bringing in Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished a book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the room\nRemember this education and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like but they saw Bush as the bad guy who ... who was who was incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything and it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years\nOr since civil earlier than me so it was a tough decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the decision\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking admission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason they got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this\nThe opposite is what they feel about Trump you know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally if for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's\nNot being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something\nIt's just the you know the ... the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's ... or Donald Trump but the CNN I think they made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport in and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your phone stop something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still an IV age\nYeah should be um breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia ah actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state\nMike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ... um Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars that our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kinda I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority your top priority is not a Judy ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the you know I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so studying like that's off the table now uh but but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing it over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but it being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative and there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I mean if you\nIf you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they're going to retaliate and it's it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nOil I that that's what they've already threatened or I go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well I think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nUh T's crossed in ... before you take any severe action I Would think\nNow look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts to Asian we I think we see that happening too infrequently or over\nThe past few decades and it and and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are sponsored this half hour zip recruiter or if you go to these job sites a lot of times you know it's great to be able to post ... ... ah you know to a bunch of job sites and you know you can get a lot of candidates but you can also get overwhelmed with tons and tons of candidates that are not good candidates they had the wrong resumes day the wrong experience\nUh and now on the way in today I heard of New York times or person\nSay ... to show G oh you really a show gee\nIt's a whole new one and now we're like a week into the store and there's already three German pronunciation\nThis guy's name ... can we fail on something we want to call them Bob I'm fine with that you would have I mean what's interesting Jamal I'm fine I'm Jamal Jamal was killed at the embassy we ought to say it was ... and what does all know Jamal\n... ... or ... ... and then whatever the pronunciation is\nTomorrow but you're right we got to get together on that because that drives me out of my mind it probably is irritating yeah it is [laughter] it is I I I never understood that Osama Osama thing how did that happen why why did that happen\nIt's even less or a ... couple right the here you have a situation where it's it's been name is spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that\nSome of what to do some but they shouldn't get a letter [laughter] they just said no no no no it's a new it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick ball to last pick I\n[laughter] like ... when did this happen used ... the guy is dead\nAnd you know ... you know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it should be Usama Osama why no one will know it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange ... it is very strange uh it and like some of it I I guess they understand like for example are here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco\nRight mhm and if you're over there they call it motorcycle\n... everyone calls it Morocco now I've never heard that I was ...\nHere's another one here we say must uh for the car ...\nIf you listen uh as as as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio\nThey seem as though it's mad stuff Toronto that's really irritating I wouldn't get us into that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off at\nThe Austin yeah they'll call us ... that were not as we are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you are you are on the commercial on a\nJaguar what it's like they like if you come up with a name on\nYour own maybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced but what is a word\nWe already know and we're going to say you were a hundred years yeah stop it ... it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to write buddy ever says jak you are [laughter]\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that see I think that's jak you are trying to seem refined\nRight like it was like um there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce ... a jaguar is like at the that that stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog and then they jak you on her [laughter]\nWould you be gone [laughter] jaguars ever they're ripping up by a bitter and into my dog in a terrible I but luckily I felt with my own sauce on top of it though everything's gonna be okay [laughter]\nThat happens is you know this is three times last week alone for me and it was fifty some for you all over the last three weeks okay oh no wonder\nYou're bleep

S. you're running a ... on the way to the rally reporters asked President Trump he believes the journalist ... dead\nIt certainly looks that way to me it's very sad certainly looks that way he said\nThere will be severe consequences if the Saudis are responsible and stocks continue their slide over fears about global growth than rising interest rates are down plunged three hundred twenty

[laughter]\nSo we'll see how that turns that will give you the updates when we get them or we need to warn you about to something that's incredibly dangerous in our society and all too prevalent in that's a Disney Princess is um we're being worn by ah some\nActresses that there is some danger there Karen nightly is promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't\nHold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter ... from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is a been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her and she says don't rescue yourself obviously and this is the one I'm\n... she's mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not really as a self yes\nShe didn't pull herself out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man or a man yeah thank you mhm there's a lot of women are doing that today\nThe main message ... or ... of really dealt entire movie a is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them\nTo rescue a especially a rash of rich guy that's the message you should be taking from those movies\nI'm Christian bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't done by Christian Bale yes [laughter]\nSo she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she ... when she read Snow White del taco bell yes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I looked at my girls and ask\nDon't you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like okay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it\nA while you nailed that when\nThey did this and then she'll also say and girls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission well no because she's in a coma mom [laughter] can't give her permission and she'll stay in a coma if he doesn't cancer\nRight I mean she's advocating for the Gilman can continue right the kids are out of it\nRight and bell says or because you can't kill someone if they're sleeping\nOn how much outside of circumstances that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book\nRight the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple there's a a a print or\nWith a magical spell the princess yeah and she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's\nKind of the premise that yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that for your lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself still worked up about that I Know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where did the\nMoney [laughter] they just torture her with an ad for the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause then you can I can understand that you know sometimes I think even you know like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things\nAre like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon the kids were watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it was like I was a captain planet or what ever do that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is admitted they you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this one will know would have been a pig or something it's usually type of pick I like to pick a lot\nA and a pet but it was talking about you know recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't looking as recycling whatever like I don't have any\nPassion for recycling I think there's some some ah\nWell it's really sad but at least it's not my fault that's a that's not really healthy instinct for parents I I Do feel like that is that the basis of it\nBecause of course you don't want no one wants anything bad to happen to their kids\nBut at the dish and all of that like you don't want to be the person who let your kid walk down a street and were something terrible happened everyone's going to look at you and say what the hell are you doing allowing them to walk down that street why were you there yeah um so it's like a double whammy\nAnd I think that leads to a lot of that over parenting stuff and ... and I'm sure this is the boat she's in her ... right like she's trying to protect me look you're not going to ... you're not going to say anything to a four year old reading Cinderella that's got to protect them from rape culture that's not going to occur\nYou're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe is so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after ... reading Cinderella\nOr watching it\nFor the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already going to be a messed up from Simba falling down and blowing the word sex right to the year from the

Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ... are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench\nWhen there was no ... and no evidence yeah and you know while first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't hear occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest eight Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations\nIt was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court because they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of it for every for every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and\nCertainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [noise] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um but\nThe other people and Cory Booker did not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no the only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus or and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and and this and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to\nA the police and and again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up it's totally different\n... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after I\nThink of how recent this Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what had happened what mine of it it happened ... none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was\nIf let's say one of the witnesses she named instead came out and yeah I remember\nThat party I remember hearing ... really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident was just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party a Kurd none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton Broderick initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten around the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred\nThere was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is a\nTimes the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that the total me to moment that only happens now\nOh after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump and that's why they have no more used for them but I mean\nBill Clinton goes along it still makes a big levels speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including cooperating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should take us there ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system\nWith actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is what that the system we have is the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're now supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard\nThat can sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two when she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some ... and she'll evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated\nOr exception of ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy the I guess they are so pissed off about that and they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad they'd even Trevor Noah who's the [noise] I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nFor the twelve million copies so I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well

way to know that ... to the conversation but still there's no way to know what it's a ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this is the subtle accusation that everyone who supported\nBrett Kavanaugh was a terrible person even from people like you know there are people in the left that you know I'm sure as I said I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court right and like no right now is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want him on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just
