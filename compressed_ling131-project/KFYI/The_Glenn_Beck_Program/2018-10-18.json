I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she\nHis phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though she was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\nMm but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is is coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly\nOr last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead um but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true\nFor her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the\nThe execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in\nHere or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this may be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia we're currently fighting\nA proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen um we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of more machinery to Saudi Arabia\nWhere we could be facing an imminent threat\nOf you know a bomb going off in a place that kills a lot of people that you know we might be able to stop this is\n... if this is this is a prosecution of a crime right in our eyes and if if they have actually killed this person they need to be held responsible however we don't need to make that decision tomorrow no we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually figure out all the dynamics going on\nJust because this is a media ... today does not mean we need to make a decision today are we actually take it seriously and look at the facts only a media ... because it involved a reporter\nAnd yeah and and and the story is so dramatic as you point out what was it wasn't at first Hitchcock movie yeah rather window right we're window I mean ... you know it's such a dramatic\nHollywood type crazy twenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you wonder I mean it it it's capturing our attention which is ... is okay it's just that we have to make sure we're looking at where the stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make Saudi Arabia look bad my guess is\nBecause I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things\nUm this ... I mean getting remember this prince took his own you know family members other princes hostage in a hotel and is likely eh stole tons of their wealth\nIncluding planes and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking their remains out in\nSuitcases so these are the planes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know in a you know rich Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia it's a lot worse than it is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this do we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we didn't with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure\nTo not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kind of ... around and calmed everybody down\nAnd then when everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I write but the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you ... your duct tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're knocked friends of ours they are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\nWe don't need it open up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nWe'll watch this closely a it's a ticking time bomb back in the second\nDe informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI Mm\nThe way [noise]\nNews I'm Carmen Robert secretary of state Mike Pompeo Romney's back in the last ... traveling to turkey and Saudi Arabia\nThe president dispatch the secretary to figure out what happened to columnist Jim ... he walked into the Saturday constantly ... two weeks ago and never reemerged Saturday and Turkish governments are leading an investigation at the Saudi constantly in Istanbul cause show these families says it wants an independent international investigation\nSuccess rich and then the Washington Post published a new ... column that I got from his assistant the day after he disappeared the column warns governments in the middle east have been given free rein to keep silencing the media more rain headed for central Texas for heavy flooding already collapsed a bridge and killed at least two people\nWe have a weather system approaching a tonight through Thursday and friday\nRun Anderson was Leno's emergency management this is Fox News [noise]\n\nMostly not here for ... for for that one of my family ...\nSeven seven seven votes hat on refined voting hours handle home [noise] his ... hustle my website apples like time [noise]\n... early ... and ... ... hanging from harmful [noise]\n\nGlen ...

around election\nTime and we have some uh twenty twenty um you know elections suggestions I'm just I'm just 'cause I'm a helper I'm a helper stew you're a helper and we just want to help the Democratic socialist out ah we've got\nSome extra spending maybe that they could consider some slogans necessarily think extra spending as possible or what their support them having a job that I don't think they've taken every dime true I yeah I mean\nDifficult to find more to spend a lot of different ways to spend them ever ... millions remember the classic documentary or from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance David received the full in here and it's a three hundred um this is an important moment uh in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take any assets so he couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right he had a zero after it's at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing we do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around so that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from then on was the idea in a in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually and this is a spoiler alert for Nineteen eighty three but how did he a wind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at ... uh so I think ah you know this is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is\nCan they figure out another way to spend\nMoney we may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a democratic socialist [laughter] and you have to spend\nSixty trillion dollars\nDo it is harder than you think it is hard to live you they can you do it\n... the socialist already have like can you do it\nVery difficult right it's very difficult when you go over that things were going back dot com slash tours the place to go by the way to get to grab your tickets Bill O'Reilly is coming up in\nJust a few minutes and we have a lot to ah to talk to him about um I I I don't know if you've seen this but uh Minnesota's democratic former ah or sorry farmer labor party ah this ah this this weekend to this last weekend said Republicans\nShould be brought to the guillotine on November So that's a that's okay though that's that's a that's not as bad as saying you want a targeted districts to take her right right yeah yeah\n... is I mean you know that's common language people always say that I bring a good team we get ... but those you know whoever into a gear team\nNow I assume mhm I hate to say this but I assume they're not actually building ... about Republicans and I'm not sure I'm not a hundred and I'm not sure it anymore I I think I Do think that the FAA you know could be talked into it\nPretty quick oh yeah and if I probably could be a Roger Williams or the congressman pointed this out in an op ed he wrote for the Dallas Morning news talking about how he was a I don't know on a baseball field being shot at 'em and kind of remembers that and and it's maybe not so a positive on this new\nDemocratic um a way of thinking where they're saying ... or Eric Holder when Republicans go low we kick them\nI'm Cory Booker says get up in the face of Congress people Maxine Waters\nA harassed members of the Trump Administration Hillary Clinton we cannot be civil\nAll these things are are are maybe a little bit more impactful to someone who was being shot at by a Bernie Sanders volunteer on a baseball field and then watching the ... almost ...\nWhat's worse but what's worth those things the guillotine or horse face seriously what's worse wow that's a great I mean one of those things deserves\nTwenty four seven coverage all I Know which one it is I Know in a class on Twitter right it's a yeah it's horse race is certainly got to be a serious issue and we all know that you know saying or space\n[noise] [noise] you know saying\nIt I mean I mean the question is what's horse horse face or the Rwandan genocide I'm On the fence on that part of it I'm not sure there are so close right and deserve the equal amount of coverage by the way our space will get more coverage than there was a genocide ever did yes yes it already has had already had already had two days and funny uh I Believe horse face\nMay have already being the baseball shooting coverage as well\nStay informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI Mm\n[noise] well it's not going to happen I mean [noise] it's a bigger picture first of all back I'm addicted to outrage like you are\n... addicted to\nOut a ... is ... and I know\nThe bigger picture here is this um the Democratic party\nIs confused now they don't know what to do\nRight I'm Juanita Broderick claimed that Bill Clinton tried to rape the press never in a million years is going to give that allegation any exposure at all non stop going to happen so you can talk about it I can talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nOr cattle why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality\nIs that is putting herself out there in these positions where she is the re litigate this stuff none of the reasons she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant so she can run again for president\n[laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you\nYou know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am\nTelling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo know I Know she wants to run do you really think she will\nIt depends depends a lot on Biden\nIt depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against her is weak which it is absolutely a week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do with Bill and Hillary Clinton they don't know what to do with them\nAll right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on a road in there and and talk to their\nDevoted supporters this isn't an accident [noise] this is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a grade a first lady as she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary's day\nThat's what this is it ... it up across the country to see how it's going to fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just gonna go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president\nAnd she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that a non\nAmerican Idol [laughter] know rushed her yeah horrible\nCrushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we got a little bit ah blood on an average and then the Cherokee Nation\nThe Cherokees themselves came as a knock it off where do you not Cherokee um this is a total rows and fraud and knock it off the Cherokee Indians themselves crazy\nOK and war and he used that ruse as I say in my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] used the wrong moves to advance their current and academia [noise] so [noise] and this is a woman who thinks she's going to win an election she's not\nOnly in Massachusetts that maybe in Oregon you know these states that she can get into the Senate\nBut as a national viable candidate in a way\n... as in the ... the number one political strategist a do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I she not only\nIs she has her grandmother who once told her when she was three [laughter]\nAnd she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um she was a chair or as a mother or you know was a source of all of\nThis but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is obsessed oh yeah\nAll right Joseph didn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't receive Scully she's\nYeah she's a system\nUh uh Paul would they call in New York She's a Paul so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes or so I mentioned to you last time I was on\nUm she and her husband say you know what they may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than ... is up there now\nI mean Michael Bloomberg\nIs going to run for president of the Democratic ticket and you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg are very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm ... and older senior citizen I I Will\nTell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think you're twenty Twenty one I think the only twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's\nThe it's the reverse you know ... they're they\nDon't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPer year to the you know I'm not sure you need the uh the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I'm going to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter\nAnymore job is smashed that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't it\nMany little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this is in her time the next time around you don't want to go up against Trump or are they just want to do that put into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about ... ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland\nMore with Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com and don't forget his new book is out killing the ss which is fantastic\nUh pick it up and grab my book at the same time by him as a a set again I think that's what Amazon is recommending people who bought this brought this to a so grab 'em 'cause they're both really good All right Mm liberty safe liberty saved the number one safe manufacturing in the nation\nIt'll it'll be two um unfortunately because there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people\nAre selfish All right they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is an annoyance but yeah I don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe they're not like me and maybe ... hit me or I'm not going to do it\nIt's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want dogs on the streets in mass beating people up and telling women that there has been shut rotten the grave we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians area the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means\nA but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia things have gotten even more bizarre and now now now they're saying that the a shaggy was alive and aware as they were dismembered seeing him a it is\nJust an amazing story I'd love to hear your take on it and also if you were the president or advising the president

excusing a antifa they are excusing everything the Democrats are saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said it's time to bring the guillotine out for the Republicans\nI'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets you um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] well I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh\nVarious ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nA with five hundred signatures are attached to it so the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have\nUm some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it\nThere are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ... possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the show is really essentially about and and a lot of people still want to look away at it\nThey they don't want to engage\nAnd um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and are elements in our society the pressure sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive\nCauses silver cylinder match the big\nDifference we didn't have that what was it a left wing press but we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's what we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\n... uh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it that we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say at the you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... march for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king um the rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time no somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out which\nIs what happened is that an over the weekend is that in ... he grew up\nDoing that would have to hire security\nThey'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes\nIt takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes you solidly still try to do with Trump\nInto basically dismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east\nIt's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt it runs terrorism and destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we al ... which style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nYou could start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four months my computer career dot edu that's my

and food and water are becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nThese people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS hounded um ... the ISIS people\nI've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and and it's it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is because they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so\nThose guys had to fight it out all the way to the end

show that I don't think you can win\nNo you don't want and we all lose in the end and and you know the sad part\nOf the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or you know as his parents wanted him to be known\n'em is going to get by as he used to call themselves going right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself that All right so Beto is running here in Texas and if you don't have and you haven't seen that you haven't been watching\nA any national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and cold there ... years and hurry where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd going to have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we know this could change\nBut well they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK\nAnd that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have it and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points this is from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with Beto tonight CNN their poll thing to forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as Eighteen\nI made that would be a real surprise uh no it wouldn't be but you know when I mean it is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe or believe the polls here in Texas you know it'd be great if he won he won by three\nBut I I just think that there is this something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I went to that group\nI tend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible\nInteresting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for ah governor here and lack of this is when you buy a much larger margin a usually\nIs or I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much heat up a age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll\nIs it the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you'd think of it break bread country right in Texas ... however are the\nPoll shows the fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance and only forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters words a forty nine forty eight but still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas it this\nWay try this on for size ah a Donald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right and it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and\nDonald Trump has a really good side and are really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh luckily not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ... you know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The
