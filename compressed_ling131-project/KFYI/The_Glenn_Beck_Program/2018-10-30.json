the radio station [noise]\nHeading for the border I leave suddenly Sarah Fox news the Pentagon and making it official revealing the number of troops heading for the southern border with thousands of migrants make their way north\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand\nThat is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world just cited let them have this scrap\nOf land and they say was theirs because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map\nAnd then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as foretold\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin could concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world it was established in the Eighteen\nHundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews and a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of all faiths\nAll faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nIs the answer couldn't be more perfect\n\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\n\nWe help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that I'm mad man went into Philadelphia\nTried to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\n\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\n\nThe horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people\nAnd yet here we are again the group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing survive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease anti Semitism is as old as the world from the moment\nGod said I Will make you my people there has been anti Semitism and eight is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always look first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's Washington blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget I've told you you are in the audience that wheel in the in the store the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence\nThe world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people because the vast majority of Americans to know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate\nHas begun again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not for rock Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time\nAnd the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos\nIt always comes in a time of fear it always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society if why\nOur founders came here in the first place it's why our founders defended the Jews\n\nWe're a different country we're in different people we're not better than the rest of the world\nWe just see things differently\nAnd if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\nOur first grade seal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the hardening of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to\nDo something to earn a living I Want to live\n\nFDR said this generation has a rendezvous with destiny\nI echo those words\n\nOur generation must be the generation that breaks this cycle there is no one else in the world who will do it\nWho will stand against this onslaught who will stand against their hatred in nationalism and the and the the collective wisdom\nThe extermination of people that just aren't good enough we are headed that way we are headed that way once you cannot talk to your neighbors once the other side has nothing to offer\nYou have to eliminate them because they're the devil\nThey're the devil and you cannot deal with the devil\n\nWheels is sixty to eighty percent of this country stand up\n\nThing never ever have they never ever have it was twenty percent twenty percent for the American revolution\nI strangely found myself feeling bad for him and not not in any other way other than look at how twisted\nThis life has become yeah and also seems like by all uh understanding of him right now she was just an utter failure in life right for a million other reasons but I mean I don't feel that he's getting absolutely what he deserves it absolutely but I you could I could see what you're saying there yeah he was just\nI mean he was he was a you know a a a misfit his entire life I mean he's but he is the quintessential example of a guy who goes out and kills he's he's mad at society because he's never felt like he has fit in\nAnd look how the press just they do they made this into Donald Trump may descended Donald Trump\nNow that one is at least you can draw a line from the idea that she is not that he was at the rally it's not Trump's ... you know ... or anything but I at least he was a Trump supporter\nBut the guy who did the shooting at the at the synagogue to try to do the same thing he outwardly hated from\nOutwardly hated him he posted on social media about how he was really just assisting the Jews\nOr that he that people thought he talked to a good game but in reality he was helping Jews and I and we need to stop it he hated the guy and then they tried to turn it into his\nWife a giants cartoon safe fell on Donald Trump\nToday and he was removed from the earth mhm all these problems would still exist this is not Donald Trump Donald Trump is a symptom\nThere is a sickness in our society our political system is nothing more than a reflection of us and people are alone they're tired they're afraid they don't want to be\nStuck in the middle between two parties that are blaming each other for everything or\nBlaming them you know why America is a little upset right now they're tired of being blamed they're out here Boston their ass\nThey're out here working every single day trying to raise their kids trying to figure out how to navigate and keep their children's states while in a prison system called school that is teaching\nAnd and doing everything that most parents believe they come home they're tired\nThey don't know how to solve it they're overwhelmed\nSociety is just pouring into their house with with the media and social media and then they have to sit and they have\nTo watch people screaming at each other on TV\nAnd there's nobody actually answering questions there's nobody actually offering us delusion none of these things anybody is talking about is the solution\nIs just blame the other side and most Americans are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed\nThey're the ones that are racist they're the ones that are massage mystic they're the ones\nExcuse me were just out here in Boston are asked trying to make a living well you freaks\nAre limited high on the hog on our tax dollars\nI'm Sorry I'm Sorry but the the what's happening in our society is a symptom\nWe are unfortunately sick\nStay informed

[noise]\nWe welcome to the program Mr a pat gray a hello pat how are you hello Glenn come good that was a good how was your week uh it was a it was not great ... why why not\nIt was a you know a bad football games uh experiences everywhere I went\nTo uh what do you what did you experience everywhere you know you're not having a hard time talking out and speaking true you know that would be easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had to really I really had a difficult time I mean I just did you guys watch the news all this week you\nKnow as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah yeah so only\nYet the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore\nYeah I I never watch cable news and never mind the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews or CNN [noise] I'd go to heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you don't want to lose I don't know who's doing that they do I really don't know who you're on fans\nWatch Fox you know 'cause uh it's a safe haven mostly English watches Shepard Smith\nUh [laughter] but that's always been that way but I don't know I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does cause that's it's on watch all\nThe people who hate Trump right yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on a sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to him talk about early do down a synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely\nBut he he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I Lived in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe's ... he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise]\nThis is a terrible tragedy then they're like well ... ... what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today\nChange and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear\nThat this shooter\nA outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we did not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to it yet but more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall are just courses pretty terrible at the moment\nBut it has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that\nWere telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a double Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever the guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try to be trained to kill thirty Republican seat\nThat's really tend to the Republicans on was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault\nNo we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about it because they\nHad a very balanced view of that one re understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time bus re understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them and and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the pipe bomb think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not eat ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob ... this morning is because uh you know uh he he sees doing more on trivia and uh and porridge trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to bend on that one\nAnd in fact repeat it ah it consistently just repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nThank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on Sunday you\nKnow because we're going to be out of town not going to be out of town really 'cause I was gonna obsess on your free tickets but seriously oh now all of a sudden you're in it can change that I can you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what it is it's Sunday\nA link Sunday yes it's called ... dot com slash tour by the way for the ticket than the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff\nYou were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the nation's turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nUpset advance it does\nAnd a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of\nThe proceeds from the I'm from the event and um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we are going to give them to yet but we're we're uh we're we're standing\nWith uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going\nUm to a\nA local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the synagogue but I'm not sure an odd sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted here's an example of supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros\nUh as as an example of how much you hate the Jews now I did respond ... I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard\nA that was a national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people crying but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though oh well that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed it's not a big one so it's just\nAmazing you know 'cause this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and I the the people\nIn this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them will criticized George Soros but they criticize him because he's a liberal has progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him as rounded him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history\nOr around the world that but anti Semite patriarch source to weigh in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew the same way they don't\nLike been Shapiro because you're in front of hero because the party policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish\nI don't like him not because he was a Jew now but because he came up with the idea of communism I I'm not a fan no not a fan of fat\nAnd the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized venue Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know they cannot do it and I it's not all under state it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right\nHere's a guy who is one of the biggest find that the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism from liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic over it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinions because they don't support what they believe it's about ... ... trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a uh it's ... again this\nIs another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nIt anyway because they don't care [noise]\nThat that that is exactly what they think they claimed to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there too [noise]\nYeah he battering I don't know I got out of ... and ah we're we're\nAnd it talked about one when we come back\nDay informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI ...\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about um [noise] buying or selling a home if you are if you're buying a home right now or you're thinking about it do it now get the low interest rate right now if you have to refinance your loan\nSo now they're complaining about the fact that their little movie got a a ... this this character removed from the show now they're complaining about it oh we just wanted him to be I mean basically what they're saying is no we don't want you to get rid of them we just wanted to write everything that he says\nWell I mean that's not the something The Simpsons signed on for yeah sorry\nTwenty I Believe all raised and this is a great lesson for everyone who tries to please\nSave Megan Kelly I think it's the same type of thing right you can't you can't no matter what you say they're never going to be pleased the people who come after you for these in these nonsensical PC issues\nWill never be pleased no matter what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter ... they're not asking you to remove up who they're not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them any earlier you realize that the better\n[noise]\nLet me change the subject to enough is enough when America will enough be enough\nNew polls Americans fed up crave unity admitted violence now this one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party they want unity that number is even higher but I'm not sure people actually\nMean this\nI'm not sure what unity even means and then they say that we no longer really um agree on the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values\nBut what are those core values\nAnybody know\nWhat are the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now way things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied\nThirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent\nFifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values sincerely what are we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's what those surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple of those aren't values those are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage we have a few things we have to decide\nWe have to decide one is the western world worth saving is freedom as our founders saw it\nIs it worth saving yes or no and I don't want to just to you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are we sincerely which are we we have to choose don't we because it's a binary choice is in it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hail is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America and not\nJust in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\nWhy is the constitution worth fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on\n\nI'm I we cannot\nSit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living and I want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line\nClimate change\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth\nOkay that's a value that's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion in ... in the scientific field\nIn China Manchuria they said the only problem was Manchuria is all the ... ... that sounds familiar a and

was an attack on each and every one of a sense\nOf a new governor Tom Wolf individual with thousands in Pittsburgh to honor the victims of the tree of life ...\nGo pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck you know there there are ... are doing on that particular day but there's one interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a districts that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then change to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that is people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a but the effects Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney in two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand and sixteen\nSo two thousand twelve on average squirting five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd two thousand sixteen it with a five point advantage for Democrats so what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nAre we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states\nSo if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six ... less passionate into two thousand sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve done it so they're kind\nOf in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correct team now there were Twenty one district that voted for Barack Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr two in two thousand twelve with rock Obama they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama or in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs it you would think of these real swing districts\nSo far polling you're showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points but it's big it's a big change to it and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ... time so if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Obama with Romney\nNo people should have to have armed security all the time that people should have to have their children find
