V. part of this people into the oh you didn't try to you you land in the bulls you know part no no no no that wasn't her job the questions that she asked of a blast before we're very very good wasn't exposed the fact that this woman was making stuff up she was rehearsed\nReading from her scripts about the things that she claims you can't be proven can't be corroborated her story fell apart under the under direct questioning from\nRachel Mitchell but\nAgain people were so blinded by hate their hatred for Trump the never Trump or is out there were so blind for the age of ... that they're willing to sabotage the process and\nThen blame ... just criticize people who actually did their job at one of the people who did that was a never Trump or and my one of my own mentors used to be a conservative talk show does cross over to the other side he's on MSNBC Charlie Sykes\nIf truthfully mattered in American politics Donald Trump with nothing more than the United states right now I mean we are living in a post with environment that snake political context here [noise] but yeah the the report from the prosecutor is ludicrous because that whole process when he was a ...\nA ludicrous it was a kabuki dance or not at all not at all\nSee if you are listening to the questions that are being asked you would realize that this is basically for three people this before the moderates on the court and if you were listening to the question and listen to the answers you would see that this woman she wasn't compelling at all as a matter of fact her testimony was full\nOf holes and it really was unbelievable passionate oh sure\nBelievable no cooperated no witnesses no but dissolve the never Trump is our\nLet me give you some hope here though because Mitch McConnell today went down on the

this talking about that how she was credible yadda yadda yadda yadda you know what happened Mitch McConnell broke it down\n\nAnd basically said well actually I'll let him tell you you know where he was going\nSo son I expect we'll hear that the conclusions of the expert prosecutor who questioned both want us as of last week's hearing are reliable\nOr let the FBI's investigation was not infinite or enlist enough for their liking maybe will hear the real issues lawsuits uncorroborated allegations of misconduct after all but rather the factor judge Kavanaugh mellow drank beer our school and college\nOr the fact that he was rightfully angry\nWhen his good name and his family have been dragged through the mud with a campaign of character assassination based on allegations\nThat lack in a ... who want to say I worry about that and ...\nThere Mitch McConnell basically put all of Democrats on point and put the never Trump burst on point and put the moderates in the Republican Party on

state of California into the formerly great city of Detroit\nAnd\n... here in Grand Rapids for\n\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was a woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend she well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years\nExperience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by ... head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again\nThe woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also\nNot a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true\nShe goes in ... her expertise is on old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right\nBefore I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any of the CNN sock it to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for prosecution [laughter] but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl ... yeah\nBrock Obama's ah the homeland security\nProsecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly what it was now she explains why she says\nFord has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session list the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attack changed to the early eighties\n\nYou might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen year in high school\nSo you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years\nIt gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged tack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early\nNineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most traumatic andme important Nick ... events of her life\nIs this significant well because\nVote yes on one twenty six vote yes on one

the narrative and they are playing the American people and here's an here's how it's working\nWhat they've done is they've turned this into something that is more than Kavanaugh look if Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us do nobody does that's a bad thing\nBut you can't just smears somebody you have to have some evidence so because of the lack of

rooting for him\nThey wanted anyone to beat the system they wanted anyone to prove that a black guy couldn't it could go to court and not be guilty that's what they wanted they wanted a victory

will provide free twenty four seven roadside assistance and a free\nYeah I mean I have remained the same I haven't changed actually take these these blue quizzes every now and then and my ideology is the same what was happening though is that the the party itself has gone absolutely and think oh this was not this is not what I signed up for\nRight um I've been watching you on Twitter and you've been um you know one of the only Democrats that have come out and said this is nuts gimme gimme are viewing the lay of the land from a democratic point of view from your point of view\nSure I think it's perfectly legitimate to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's nomination on the basis of differences in judicial philosophy you know if you believe certain things that he doesn't align with those beliefs would find out what the democratic process as for\n'em now that being said you you leave it at that rate you don't go ahead and try to chop off someone's head and promote these outrageous accusations against him specifically the the one by this this woman Julie sweating it who just don't even ask the snow I mean\nWe're there they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I could kind of speak to the culture and how how those communities operate I mean the thought that a group of Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape cartel all throughout high school and nobody would know anything about it\nUp until now is just ludicrous and then that eight\nAnd a goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened achievers frequenting parties with high school ...\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man oh all me and my buddies we were the college chicks were all over [laughter] you know women women usually look for a younger man\nYou know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who what should be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete dark when he was ... when he was in high school this is somebody who kept\n... you can see on his calendar he literally has no one has parents would ground and this guy was a complete ... in high school and he's like the kind of guy if he comes home with your daughter or your sister your day she really did well first off there's this great I'm really happy\nSo the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel in the suburbs of Maryland it's just asinine on his face but you're saying that we have entered I think that we abandon a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on\nMatter of faith based on historical\n... of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late\nThat they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things\nOr because you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism and there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right it's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse this is like reliving the O. J. case again\nWhere OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he wasn't guilty\nBecause the LAPD is allegedly races\nRace so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life and they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at that time they actually believe he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the Nicole\nAnd they all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and it let me think I think a\nDoctor's poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt or testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it\nPhysically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what they're doing now is that they're moving the goalposts right I\nI saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank when he was in in college or whatever who cares\nBut it's completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like waiting at him a Lawrence those goalpost seemed kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo Shankar what we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who uh has not lost his footing ah with with reason um so the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says\nYou know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes then there's also a a a chance at USCB Cooper right in the ... you have to go by the evidence that case you have to evaluate a case that based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular\nSituation other people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he is he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the commit this right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion and in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is exculpatory right that the guys calendar clear is that right it's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also ears him so you you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nTheirs is into court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but you're you're you're you are asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because what you have here\nIs a series of of accusations that have been made with zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back us up and then when you actually analyze the ... no evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I'd never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now and based off his own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not Brett ... we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with his judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right week we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically\nThat's insane that's what they do and and and banana republic that in third world countries that's not who we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I\nI Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally do you have to I'm I actually have to run the meeting about okay All right well run to talk we'll talk some other time making so much [noise] I really want to I really want to hear from people\nAh they can respond to what I'm hearing from the Democrats now which is um um\nWe just have to stop all of these people the people all the people on the all the people on the right to you know we need to break up their dinners you know as I said earlier one one prominent Democrat said we should um ... what stops us from disturbing people where they sleep\nIt's it's your utopia\nThere remains about fifty percent of the country and I'm going to be really generous I going to make it a lot easier there's thirty or forty percent of the country that disagrees with your utopia they just want to go in a different direction\nWhat do you do with the forty percent of the population that does not agree with you\nWhat do you do with them [noise]\nWhat do you do to make sure that those people don't start infecting the minds of authors\nSo your perfect utopia starts to fall apart\nWhat happens with the ones who won't comply with these new rules what do you do to make sure that that utopia it remains in place by keeping all of those people in power because there's going to be another election\nAnd if if history tells us anything it swings the other direction what once you have the power what are you willing to do to keep the power\nIf your answer to all of those questions isn't nothing you\nHave gone over the cliff\nBecause in America the answer to what are you going to do to all of those people who disagree the answer in America is nothing what are you willing to do to keep your power or the answer in America is nothing\nWhat do you do just to silence those who will not comply the answer in America is nothing\n\nSo any time somebody says we should shout these people down they've taken the first step all thought is creative\n\nWhen you begin to speak things they use speak them into existence\nWhen you say we shouldn't round people up the more people that say we should round people up we should disturb them in their own homes we should we should picket and surround their houses the more that you say that the more reality\nIs created in that direction\nBe very careful on what you say and what you think\n\nThe answer to these questions in America must remain\nNothing\nI Will not do anything to my neighbor who disagrees to me with me I Will not do anything and everything to hold on to power\nI Will state my case and I will Duke it out on the battlefield of ideas\nI Will not silence other people\nI Will not smear or destroy other people I Will not be calm everything I\nDespise I Will not to become a fascist\nJust stop fascism [noise]\nBack in a minute with the

you're a voter in New York\nI have Fifteen minutes or ... it made me less now twelve minutes now scheduled with him but I'm hoping that he has more time because I think you're going to be fascinated by his story and I want to start at the beginning with him let's go to Larry shore bell hello Larry how are you\nEh Glenn how you doing good morning\nThe morning or so I wanted to talk to you I'm really from the beginning if you have time to tell me the story of your life because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood\nYour your dad was black your well your mom was white they weren't married he was in the sixties\nThat's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't accept you is that how it started that's true okay tell me the story from there\nSure um I was born in Manhattan I'm as you as you said by racial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption\nSo uh my biological father was not in my life\nSo I don't know um what he was thinking but that he wasn't in my life so I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was ah my mom who was my mother um was German and met my father who was black in the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx\nAnd that's where I was raised by Yankee Stadium and you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was raised this was not the best neighborhood\nUm so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers um the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and then worked in a bank\nShe then I left and we all we left together we were eight got enough money to we actually are packed up it was out to Long Island when I was around eleven years old or my father finally made enough money to my mother we work hard to get out we got out of the the bad neighborhood and got to Long Island and when my ...\nMy father died he died of cancer and when he passed away it was very hard for my mom\nBecause how old were you I was a twelve so\nWhen my father died um my mother's down there was in Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family I'm a band that has also so we were basically now\nI'm at that point is very hard for myself and my mom of course as you could assume so by the time I was Seventeen I was ready to get out of here and I decided to get out and I thought you know what I'm gonna go off I'm going to join the army that's what I saw it on the go join the army like my father would be like my dad and go join the army\nSo I go off to the recruiting station I'm In this case they are all for recruiters in the same building and I go to the army recruiter and he tells me son is going to be great we're gonna make you a general\nAnd and the moms and you're going to be you know probably in the world and meat and beautiful women and\nI'm Seventeen thinking my God this is going to be great and I walk out with all the the go army stuff in my arms and the book covers I'm Still in high school at the time and he said and as I'm walking out the marine corps recruiters their arms folded and he says a song and I talk to you\nThat you're going side he goes an army guy he promised you a lot didn't he I said yes I Am going to be a general and like one of the world's going to be amazing the beautiful women and get a doctorate degree in three days can be awesome\nAnd he says yeah we call that the solar plan everything under the sun he goes you know what am I promise you I said what he said for ... years are you ready I said yes and I signed up\nWhen I look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing what I'm saying I was just reacting but when I look back at that I Know I was desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have\nAnd wrinkled gave me many of them and that was a great thing that the marine corps the military's not everybody and not much to join but for me it really helped me tremendously

know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what you don't know what's right for me in Queens either were even\nHow would you be you you let me be me and we can all be free to gather\nWhat a concert had work it has word that's our original idea we just haven't had done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York what do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote because a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority of ... we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing I'm going to happen ... percent ... percent of the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be with you when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more broadly as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nIt does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this ... this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York uh would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even come in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it wouldn't make better Democrats embed Republicans\nBecause right now Republicans just have to talk about opposite catching the Democrat they don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government they will have to worry about lower taxes so important is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right\nBut when there's a third party that will libertarians can point the finger and say Democrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government now they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\nThere will be a massive massive culture shock within within the uh the state of the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back I don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing\nI'm
