him at a [laughter] and uh Jason welcome to the program Jason has been following this caravan thing uh for a quite a while and we've been talking about the use of this\nTactic for I don't know ... years this is what they're doing to the Israelis ... they have they are attacking the Israeli borders\nAnd what they do the Israelis respond but the media only ... only covers the response not the attack and they never look\nInto who's really funding all of this it's just a poor Palestinian children want to come over you know that's not what it is that's not what it is and it appears more and more that that's not what this is either Jason\nRight and this is something that it's kind of amazing when you look at how the media doesn't cover but things are they don't look in the direction they're supposed to be looking at\nAnd it's amazing to me that are small little media footprint here we were the only wants to point this out long before anybody else even started catching on like you were the first one I think this was like two and a half weeks ago or something like that\nThey said wait a minute who are these guys that are organizing all this and when we dug into it were like wow we just like a radical left is he's a radical leftists with ties to both ... and to a Raul Castro in Cuba\nAnd older people and the former a head of state for Honduras who was a surprise surprise uh Iraq Obama said was a coup well no it was the Supreme Court that said of Honduras that said the president\nIs is acting unconstitutional he is trying to change the constitution so we can have a military state under his rule\nSo the Supreme Court said arrest him and kick him out right that that's that's what happened that's what happened now they're unhappy about that now can you tell me a little bit about all the because most people don't know about all but yeah so when\nA that that ban that now deposed leftist Marxist a president when when when he will just\nHe was deposed he was working on with both Venezuela and Cuba this massive like I Want to call it like a European Union a type alliance within South America\nAnd it was ... it was called album and it was called the I think the acronym was something wrong lines of the alliance for the boulevard in a people of our America\nSo it was that was supposed to be the check to us our to rise up in South America and right and um yeah our American\nAnd they were going to have their own currency um I don't know about maybe military uh agreements would have ... possibly could have followed I mean there were big plans for this I also want to point out that one of the key observers like an international in Austin agreements trade agreements you have like he outside observer than\nI'm One of them their main one was Iran who is also a a an ally ally of Venezuela um keep that in mind for lay on this discussion when we talk about possible people who are tagging along and some of these care of that\nI fully thinks he knows I think I heard your interview with Governor happened yesterday yeah he he knew as well he knew and of course that's something he would not come out and say oh Venezuela behind that and the governor of Texas is not going to say that but I Do think vice president Pence tipped his hand on that I really think that they're behind us and the question now is how does this escalate\nYou mentioned waves of attacks we already know there's a there's a Caribbean forming in El Salvador there's a carrot and forming in Guatemala and who are they form of who's forming them and I we don't know the organizers yet but those are all they're all in the same border all with ... so the same people that liberty and re foundation party look that up when you're looking at these things up and doing your own homework\nLiberty and re foundation party in Honduras I Would not be surprised if what if we hear more names in El Salvador in Guatemala forming these\nUh caravans because the ah Honduras border was a shutdown pretty heavily they crack down on that border so they can't send more people find doors anymore so they'll probably go there are those are their allies in El Salvador Guatemala are probably just forming them in their border countries\nAnd the press won't look into this in fact the press is downplaying this now and the reason why is because they know this is a nightmare for Democrats in the election this is an absolute nightmare the build up to it\nWhat happens on the border may actually work to their advantage politically because you'll have the big fat American Soldiers standing up but the build up before the border they are saying this is a conspiracy we don't know where they're headed yes yes we do yes we do we know what their intent is to cross our border\nAnd mass

Fox News the total now seven the FBI confirming a second package down we'll send in California all visited the congresswoman Maxine one\nKind of case in particular and out of me very much guys determining gender I mean nowadays gender is in it started as free floating nebulous ... that that is completely divorced from biology but it very much\nA link to biology and anatomy and Ninety nine percent of that are biological ... is our gender I of course that's not the case with everybody but the vast majority by that is the case and and I don't think there's anything wrong with that\nSo so wait a minute so so hang on but\nThe middle of the times article was saying is that gender happens and I am willing to go back to the you know a definition male born this way female born this way you want to say gender is male or female specific but I'm also willing to say OK\nGender is this the traits but it is not to biological and we will they go that\nFar however ... ... what what's happening here is um they're they're taking away sex and tying it to gender and so why would we have why would we have\nMale and female sex if it's all gender if it means the same if it means the same thing it doesn't talk about trades\nThe other part is isn't that gender disc for ya if it is all happening in your head then that's this for you is it not\nA hail you're saying well I think now a days people tend to use the way gender across the board one because they don't want it like that that makes my comfortable but I think also from an ideological perspective and makes it easier for people to you\nArgued that you can identify whatever you want because it's a little bit trickier I think\nMost people still have the ... the common sense to know that biological sex isn't it all out to argue for say something like transgender rights it becomes helpful for them to say well maybe it's not about ... biology it's about\nGender which is you know they say it's a social construct or whatever which isn't but it makes it a little bit easier to argue that okay someone to weigh someone's field may not necessarily be linked\nTo their biology they're not sure if that really speaks to the point you're making\nSo but it was can you explain what gender does for is\nRight so it's the feeling that someone feels more alignment with the opposite sex than their first insect someone with a born male but they would feel more I'd do they fit in the female role\nOkay how has gender just for a a been embraced is gender just for a a good thing or a bad thing\n...\nI I think it's seen as I don't think it should be seen are good as good or bad I think it's a medical condition and I think people who are suffering should be able to have access to care and I think adults\nShould be allowed to transition if that's the best approach for them but I think nowadays it's kind of glamorize and seen as something that is really um almost\nPrefer knowledge I prefer to society but it's almost like seen as a positive\nThing especially among progressive people\nBut he but here's my ears would point but it isn't um isn't anorexia form a of of physical this more for you but you see your body as fat even though you're sixty pounds isn't that just for you\nRight true the thing that gender thus far it is it does have biological correlate so this is a thing I find very confusing about the whole transgender movement is that you know some people argue that biology has nothing to do with it other people argue that it is strongly biological I Would think that\nProponents on this movement would want to\nBe in alignment with the science that does showed a biological doesn't that adds some sort of solidity I guess what they're saying because\nIt has to do with hormonal exposure in utero so I'm an example I can give is say girls who are exposed to a higher level of testosterone into ... so higher levels of exposure to testosterone is associated with more male typical interests and behaviors of girls who were exposed to higher levels of testosterone when they're born\nThere more male typical and their behavior they're all the more likely to watch how the male gender identity\nSo it's based on the biological influence even though\nPeople want to say that gender something that I've lost their first from that\nSo I I guess one of the things as I was reading the story a darker so is is that there is a it's almost like we're talking about two different things uh you know what we were if what gender is ... a feeling\nThat is an interesting thing for people like you to win to research on it and even if it's a biological ... they were you were ...\nUm but it's not necessarily of interest on a on a form you know where you're turning into the government parade I mean like that but it's a it's a different I mean maybe in certain circumstances but why the government is asking for this information is not necessarily about someone's feelings\nAbout it's about a a physical characteristic that they hold\nSo I mean is it just it is it just basically the gender does it mean what it used to me are the are they using gender to say this is a feeling\nAnd therefore we should almost come up with a different word for what because what I'm describing and what we've talked about this entire time has nothing to do with feeling it's male or female about yeah it's about physical characteristics what does the word for that\nAs to what you mean I think from the perspective of what the administration is trying to do I think they shouldn't be allowed to collect that information that information and those data\nWithout it being such a controversial issue um\nAnd you know with regards to protecting title nine and and women's rights I I don't know why people don't see it from that perspective that this is a positive thing because shouldn't that be seen as helping women right um and it kinda does boil down to this larger argument that's going on right now about people who are born female\nVersus the rights of transgender women and our transgender women\nWomen full stop and so there is the argument going on I don't know if either if you've been following this but with um it's been mostly radical\nFeminist I wouldn't consider myself a radical feminist but you know this group of very progressive women who are saying transgender women are not as saying that people who are born female so in this argument transgender activists have been winning so far and we see that in terms of how this narrative has played out with the recent decision but in terms of what you're saying I I\nI I see what you're saying that I guess I'm using\nDifferent words to kind of mean the same thing in that yes for people who are male or female that gender is basically ... it is at the end the day the same thing but nowadays genders being used in a different way to kind of argue for more progressive idea that you can do whatever you want\nTo and I'm not saying we're the best thing for them but that's not that I'm not completely insane in in the belief that gender used to me 'cause I Know right like this is what I mean that would be making this word and making it it mean feelings instead of what it used to mean which was biological gender\nAnd treats\nRight and that that's why I think and\nSpread through this larger idea that genders spectrum because if you feel a certain way on one day and you feel differently on another day that must mean that your gender must be something unrelated to a sex which is incredible\nSo more and more follow up on this is just as the New York times says identity comes from the gender identity comes from the brain not the body that originates between your ears than not between her legs if that is accurate and that was a defense of the transgender argument right is not a ton of criticism of it it's just it's a defense of it\nIf that is true and it's in your brain and not between your legs why or their physical surgeries associated with being transgendered\nRight I mean that argument doesn't really make much sense and I I don't like the argument 'cause it's not really accurate either because what's between your legs and what goes on your brain is linked show you can't really separate the two and treat them like they're completely different phenomena\nUm but I mean there's a lot of the of aspects of this argument that don't make sense I mean transgender actress will also say that gender is a social construct\nBut if that's the case why do you then made hormonal intervention to transition or just feel more in line that was the the fact that you identify as so I guess my biggest gripes on this whole thing is that you know sex is about being male or female gender is how you feel in relation to your sex but again as I said\nFor the vast majority of us are biological logical sex does dictate our gender so I don't think the three of us are necessarily that you know do things that differently even though I'm using different terms to describe it\nAs he really the difficulty and politically incorrect question um if if if this more for your for instance\nIs we we say that it's bad to be anorexic because you were seeing your body and the way that is not reality and it's a dangerous it doesn't it's not a healthy the outlook\nUm we see the stats of people who have gender ... and the suicide rates are really bad\nHaving the sex change and everything else is not changing those suicide rates so why are we taking the the gender is more for you and say hey it's totally fine when it's not it's not the suicide rates were bad\nNews talk five fifty KFYI the valleys talk station [noise]\nIt might be hard to find good craftsmanship these days but it is out there if you want thoughtful attention to

end your honor\nShe's not pretty either right and I think that the the there's two sides of this there's the libertarian amazes chronic whatever they want I don't care and that's fine but then there's also the truth brings it like signing why it matters is the science part\nYour your right when you talk about insurance why do we have to be male or female insurance well you know what that woman might have to be checked by a ... dollar just from time to time\nBecause she might have bought cancer at some point nicely put yeah okay I mean that that's just reality right and that is why I Lived up is important and you said it I mean the doctor said it a bunch of times you just said it in the last conversation feels felt feel felt feel felt\nThe feelings are interesting you can cover them you can be interested in that we all\nLook at ... watch out for each other ... we can try to guard them if we wish however it's completely separate than a scientific fact her feeling is a feeling\nIt's not fact\nAnd that's fine\nThat's fine but you can't sing gauge from facts Mm\nStay informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI Mm\nCome [noise]\nFox News I'm Carmen Robertson national search for a bomb maker\nSo far the but the devices have been what appear to be a pipe bomb\nNYPD counter terror director Jon Miller under seven packages into CNN former CIA director John Brennan and Democrats including the Obamas in Clinton's two were sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters President Trump calls the threats despicable\nWere extremely angry upset\nUnhappy about what we what this this morning and we will get to the bottom of the news\nOf the suspicious packages weighing on stock the down for plunging six hundred eight points ... three hundred twenty nine\nAdds a trainer start to contemplate earning performing as well as taking any information at a news as we saw it on the fishes packages delivered to Democrats Fox\nBusiness Network to Jerry Lewis and the red Sox win game two of the world series this Fox News [noise]\n[noise] Mm\nYou're listening to ... it's been about three or four hours yesterday was Sean Spicer is a fascinating guy fascinating guy yeah certainly has an amazing life it's\nAnd so yeah a couple of years yeah he's a guy who has a perspective not necessarily just another opinion everybody's got opinions everybody has to arm pits too and I don't necessarily want to smell yours I'm a ... perspective really that matters a and\nHe has a really interesting perspective from what he what he has gone through a and um\nI did a pod cast with what's come out a couple of weeks and then we we had him on the news and why it matters um and he was actually very positive uh about this this upcoming election for the Republicans if people turn out to vote\nHe was in the you know it there is a interesting thing that's been going on we've seen some positive trends for Republicans in these polls\nUm there's a theory out there which is a is a competing theory or as to what's going to happen with the election we're about two weeks away people are voting right now though I think up to seven million people nationwide ever voted at a as of yesterday\nI Believe is the number so voting I mean this is election day you're in the middle of it right now\nUh this is now we have two week long election base that's just the way the world is um and it's interesting the idea that's being floated by people who want to give the Democrats shot at the Senate a better shot at the house\nIs there ... there was evidence of a cabin up bump\nHowever that's not going to carry you to the election and we saw real improvement for the you know in the Senate for Republicans after Kavanaugh which of course is the exact opposite of white was done right like I mean Democrats did this to hurt Republicans actually seemed to help them and that I think it's pretty well established in the polling so far\nThe idea is and and there's some basis for this thing happening\nIs you get the bump from Kavanaugh but it's not too far away from the election and doesn't help you a good example of of this exact phenomenon playing itself out if this is true would be the Access Hollywood tape Access Hollywood tape came out in early October ... um Trump's polls plummeted\nOr ... Hillary's went up that she opened up a very large lead and that lead\nTrickle down down down down down until the ... the very end they went from about eight or nine points right after that tape all the way down to about two two and a half points which is where the national polls ended up with the Clinton up about two two and a half points about um so\nThe idea here is Kavanaugh gives them this nice bump and then it said before the election and the Democrats are able at the last second to cross the finish line ahead there you know some of the polling is is somewhat interesting on this if you look at\nA recent polling um they came out with the most recent poll from um the cruise O'Rourke a race now ... there's been a couple of polls taken over the past week or so that have put Cruz only up four or five\nNo there isn't holding their was seven and nine and ten and twelve point leads for cruise the past few polls have been more like four and five point leads for starting to turn the other way which is the last thing you walk is tightening Mario and that was one of the arguments\nAre Sean Spicer was making ashtrays really got to watch the trends which where these things are going now I think there was evidence you know there is evidence I think that uh you know the pictures mix we don't know this is one race there was some polling though that showed in Florida as well a pretty decent pulling for Democrats in the Senate\nThat came out yesterday with no set up by for\n... uh there was a you know but I'm the same plane though I mean Menendez of New Jersey\nNow again once again look vulnerable after it seemed like he had re open up a lead and maybe he would cruise to the finish line he's now only up by three in a poll that just came out\nA ... and you know you never id you could fool yourself as a Republican thinking going to win a lot of New Jersey racist but it does I mean Chris Christie was governor there for two terms of just casually happened\nUh eminent as the terrible candidate who you know ... or white likely was paying underage prostitutes for sex and he was not able to convict over ... to ... ah well do you judge whether you think that's a good or bad today I feel like it occurred [noise]\nAh so I didn't polling pretty mixed right now there was another fall by the way I'm an ... you know um some polls are showing that Cruz over race even tighter so I don't know I mean it it was interesting to hear Sean Spicer talked about it because Spicer as you would know is that you know was the original spokesperson\nFor Donald Trump or and became famous for that but has a very long ... long military career and he was a he was a very much a a you know a Washington insider really knew the behind the scenes politics of it and you hear him talking about politics he knows this stuff you can rattle off these races like nobody\nYou'll find the perfect fit ships free within twenty four hours with filtered by dot com they're made in America\nOh oh\n\nOne winner\nIn the uh in the lottery one winner at one point is it six or for one point one point six billion dollars six billion\nDollars that arise oh a lot of times it rises on the last minute but it was at least one of the biggest the lottery a word in history going to one person in South Carolina so you're getting\nProbably nine hundred if you take it all in one\nLump yes ... ... yeah it's nine hundred and something million nine Thirteen I think it is and how much do you get if you take it yearly believe it's twenty two point six million dollars for every year yeah a Thirty Years' so twenty forty five can I tell you something\nI normally say take the money and run and I would take the money I if it were me I Would take the money and run because I don't know if that things are going to sit around for twenty more years gone del put his what could happen in Twenty years yeah I'm however twenty two million dollars\nA year ear live in white lard\nAnd I will say to actually has a ... ah I'm noticing there's a note at the top of this was his originally written for a previous story they've just updated it to hit so the twenty two point six million was on a seven hundred million dollar jackpot so we are talking more of the job that you're probably about close to about fifty million per year ... who are your\n... your fight\nYeah take the new ... it's funny hasn't the advice always been you you're an idiot if you take the anybody yes I'm this article goes through a and analyzes it and talks about how the tax benefits are there for you to take the annuity\nUm you're going to get a return that you can't necessarily get in a bank account from the annuity and that's pre tax and hour and ... if you build your only built one Easter\nRight and you know they actually pointed out to a this is actually pretty funny article of this leads us to the biggest advantage of the annuity protecting you from yourself\nAgain I don't know all about you but I Do know you buy lottery tickets so let's consider the possibility that you were not one of your generation decreed financial mind\nI'm ... and it goes on to say the other thing is uh you will have an excuse to not give every single person who comes up to you money 'cause you don't get it all at once so instead of having a billion dollars in a million dollars a year is that\nTax free [noise] uh I have to pay taxes on the fifty million dollars to pay taxes on it [noise] well I can only twenty five million right again and but I mean for you know\nThere is at least some limit right like I had to get more next year but I did just by a fancy house than a fancy car and this I gave money to this person and like you're gonna have to wait twenty five million dollars a year after\nTaxes you are living large yeah that that the cross the line where you're you're basically doing anything you want but excessive by multiple private jets and like that super duper high end stuff\nYou're not you know you're not going to get\nYou you probably could if you've got fifty\nMillion dollars a year if you go into my income and you could certainly do it yeah but I mean you're not buying you can't pay for them and cash you know but you wouldn't want to either if you have a guaranteed Twenty years of fifty million dollars why paying\nCash yeah I mean it seems to any bank is going to give you the low\nIt just feels weird to pay someone interest on anything when you're in that financial decision but yeah I guess you could certainly get it what do you care\nOr it's not gonna be all that much I guess in the grand scheme of things about congratulations to uh whoever our South Carolina listener um who we of course made that incredible deal with to get a I remember going to stay on each other out of that when they win and it just running as a as a nice thank you ... for our you know doing the show all these years\nAll these and we appreciate it we appreciate it a you know that I talked with us we love your son we've always love you ever your daughter whichever you are with other you you are part of this family if you won\nOr lost we were always with you yeah we would have obviously shared our winnings with you so we would have as you listen to this obviously\nWe have we would have absolutely no by it if if I were the won the lottery everyone in this audience would be a millionaire today really yeah I we have a much smaller audience than expected [laughter]\nWell I've seen the numbers that would that would cause you a lot more than one point six billion well I'm just I'm just saying you know my heart would say we're all millionaires oh okay\nI wouldn't actually give anybody else you know a dollar of it but in my heart we'd all be\nBillionaire oh yeah it's great it's not worth anything but it's great [laughter] so\nLet me ask you this you one fifty million dollars a year yes I Know you don't even call me\nAll about showing you would never even hear my voice again yeah so there's no there's no like hey Glenn it's been great you know here's ten million oh good God no yeah I might find someone you really hate to pass along the message [laughter]\nRight into your house sorry George Carlin I got a message or maps after I worked for him but [laughter]\nUh yeah I mean it's a it's a big life change at that point I don't think there's another deadline I have in life\nLike I thought about that like I still do a lot of the same things that I Do now there's a lot of the work that I Do that I Love and I would do separately from having a job but like I'm not getting up early to do it you know I got to happen in you know like I'm not like oh you need that turned in by friday when I get on the two thousand\nThirty nine my luck I suddenly nam like a twenty something\nYou know I may not show up tomorrow yeah oh yeah oh you open it nine\nOh one [laughter] well well I'd embarrass him a letter to [laughter] [laughter]\nDay informed real news been real time news talk five fifty KFYI ...\nAll right for the soul soul for everybody else except the one lottery ticket winner um you need to be prepared for whatever happens I mean if you want and fifty million dollars a year\n[noise] [noise] yeah I guess this but you have somebody\nWell you know it's Eric Holder it's it's below sea it's Maxine Waters who writes that she and arms financial services committee together and when they start telling everybody to like you say go Lola\nRun people out of restaurants I mean I've had all that experience to me also uh is just wrong and the shame of it is they haven't been shot at they haven't been shot they haven't been wounded\nAnd I take personal uh and all of us do personal a problem with it or is there they're mouthing and uh and and they're creating a really really problem in in our country severely use the word keeps being used but we didn't have no civility there's we're not going to get back to where\nPeople can agree to disagree in a in a civil manner it's just being stirred up\nAnd a lot of it by the liberal left there's no question about it so\nIt bothers us and uh you know I've had my daughter had a wedding several weeks ago we had protesters at a wedding uh I've been yelled out at restaurants less like a lot of my colleagues uh it a kind of takes the fun out of this right but at the same time we we serve for a lot of different reasons\nAnd I hope we can get back to where we can agree to disagree again\nSo the um the bombs or the suspicious packages Clinton's Obama Soros the White House\nAh now CNN Today are and to fall on the streets I'm ... I'd have to point out the Proud Boys you know answering the that by going out and and\nUh delivering blows once somebody you know throws a punch them a doesn't seem like we're getting any better\n[noise] no we're not getting any better and and you know and then it's not right either that or President Obama President Clinton President Trump\nHave to have these packages delivered to to

spoken people at throwing bricks through our windshield of our car or van followed it broke and\nAh and ah you know stole everything that was in it\nWhat do people like you are sitting on a committee with Maxine Waters you have to have said to her have you've forgotten what happened to the baseball diamond or I mean right have you said these things to learn how to respond\nYou know I have said it to her and I said it to a lot of my\nAh those on on the other side and and they don't respond\nThey just uh uh they just look at you I mean and and it's a shame and and the fact that matter is uh [noise] uh I guess they don't want to remember it but I Will tell you this about the baseball uh incident I travel all over the country and of course as you said earlier news cycle goes quick but\nThere's still people remember and come up to you and say I'm praying for you congressman I remember I was on that morning when I heard about it uh it it was a ... it was a moment that I don't think it's going to leave when the ... when it's a it's a moment that shows\nThe ... how low we'd gone but when you mention it to to Maxine you mentioned it to\nSome of the others they had no response\nAt all and uh they just moved on they just moved on we were just lucky or whatever and I'm a it's a it's a bad bad environment it's all generated I Believe from the dislike of this president\nBangor Maine ... rather the president failed in the country succeed\n... what do you say to people who would say well he's engaging in the same kind of ...\nWell I mean I hear that too and and and and I guess I could say there's some things probably I don't agree with we all need to dial it down but\nAh I ah I I it's not right and and and and we just need to ... it's it's just land it's hard to say everybody in their heart needs to look at what we're going through right now it's not getting any better it's not getting more civil it's who can do more to the other side\nAnd uh you know I I guess I Would say in my world it started at a baseball field and I know who started that and what it wasn't a it wasn't that it wouldn't have a a conservative on the Republican side start\nYou know right before the civil war um some there was a beat and with a cane by a by a a a a congressman and the will of the Senate\nAnd uh he almost died nobody they didn't they didn't even arrest the congressmen nobody said anything about it uh and in fact they they made little they took the pieces of wood and made little Keynes\nAnd they wore them around their neck as a as a badge of honor that you know don't mess with our party cars will beat you to death\nMhm uh I mean I I when I read that years ago I thought well we're a long way from civil war but I'm not sure we are that far from that kind of barbarism\nWell unfortunately instead of using canes we're using guns right now and uh you know I mean to go to a restaurant with your family and be yelled at to get on an airplane to go back to D.C her to come home and be yelled at ah\nWhat's that feeling oh it just a CNN says that's not a mob [laughter] well\nI'll tell you can have a mob of hundreds a mob of millions of novel one and uh

here to talk about a project that you're working on about pornography\nYeah we uh we've created a resource now because\nI'm you know this issue isn't going away when you look at culture and you see how broken culture is that the number one area that it's broken in his in issues related to sex and sexuality and gender I mean we can't even look at people and say\nYou're a man or woman at the trigger some sort of reaction and everyone is up in arms about it and so you have a culture that's gone completely off the rails\nAnd so what we're doing as we've sort of press the reset button on that and we've sort of gone back to ground zero and how did God design sex how to guide design sexuality and\nAnd so where we zeroed in on was pouring because we think corn is the main driver of that dysfunction that we're seeing in culture and the numbers are more staggering now than ever before\nOr in churches only nine percent of churches have actually resources dedicated to it so that's why we created set free course dot com\nOr so that people can go and and so that hopefully churches use it and and take a look at it and really it just presses the reset button on how God designed sex 'cause you know ... is a dirty word often in some circles but\nUm and people sort of pushed that over but God created it you know God designed it for our benefit\nIt's really quite amazing we were watching something I don't remember what it was and we were [noise] my wife and I were talking\nAbout ah the medieval times ... enemy all times you know uh it was a sign of wealth and\nBeauty of your teeth were rotted because they had just discovered sugar so that meant that you were full of sugar yeah ... yeah you had lots of food um they used to use ear wax\nIs chap stick ah you know [laughter] I said I said all addiction to sexuality and with that comment I said I said I\nCan't even imagine kissing or being near somebody back then the God yeah it was brilliant with the sex drive [laughter] because it'd be like comedy and you'll be like new thank you yeah [laughter] how do you how to you to be stronger than it is and yes I think\nYou're right but for those who want to tear that apart and tear that vision of our where's the where's the lowest hanging fruit I mean you talk about that sex drive we'd go off the rails with it what what is the lowest hanging fruit to break up the family and screw up you know a ... effects were\nWere idiots guys we when we fall for everything that you know it doesn't take much\nAs ... as I Know\nAnd and their numbers of bears this out I mean and even among Christians that's where the shocking thing it's like culture it's like everyone's got the rope or now I mean the numbers or eighty percent of people all people as being foreign like you know an unfair especially from guys but Christians are not immune to this and so\nThis ... this study from bar that came out recently sixty five percent two thirds of Christian men have viewed porn\nThey they view at about at least monthly they admit to that so many things thirds of Christian men\nAnd the porn is not like when I was growing up you know there was one\nKid that had a playboy magazine you
