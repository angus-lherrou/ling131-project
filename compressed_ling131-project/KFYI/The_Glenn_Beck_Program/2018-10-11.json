I mean 'cause I saw lots of tea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight I Am I trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis\nMarched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember where\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington\nDC you would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nBy the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like charging cities and\nThey're taking over it that's the I shouldn't that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people\nOne that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that their usage\nSo is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are trying to what\n... cents on causing trouble in tents on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh's a terrible person and stopping him as good so that's not causing trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess the end but that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right just as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't\nSay you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying\nThough is that the media does not see harassing conservatives as causing trouble\nCorrect that is the issue correct they see this as a ... like the you know there is basically you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean the Irish guy and the Irish guy who runs this ... [laughter] let me tell you the white people white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay so let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob BS I'm going to call it a mob\nA now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is protests is guaranteed\nYou know a a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy\nFor what a mob a\nProtest that looks like he is a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife I only around and said things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his route as he said knock the crap out of them are what you and says say OK tests knock the hell I mean okay alright okay we got it\nNow that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push\nProtesters again now to\nSorry sorry [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo they go anywhere we see that now here's\nHere's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says\n... I think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but\nWhat do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nEconomic recovery following a catastrophic downturn millions of Americans continue to feel left behind yep that's that's been proven now we're not in a tepid recovery are we some turn their anger on corporations and Wall Street yes that would be the left that would be the last ... others target non white immigrant workers\nWho's doing that\nI mean I guess they would claim that like border enforcement right like\nYeah that's border enforcement that'll offering than ... yeah the ... the law they're claiming we do not know who's in our country and we're also worried about terrorism I'm a charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities well who could that be [laughter]\nI I I Know and I know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that religious majorities it's the left\nConservatives denounces the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the I'd said stored socialism yep did that one because\nThat's what's happening that's what did happen I ask a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez yeah if it's if it was a crazy accusations right point\nMany on the left warn that fascism is taking root and America no socialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people unless they fascists every time someone do something they don't like right as the ... fascism it that is it socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline where all socialist now that's what's sleeping is sweeping the nation\nAre parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties oh that\nIs an understatement of the year can you say that a lot of the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect but I didn't have one way to describe yeah you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate\nBut at an age on night late Nineteen thirties as today political rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies sparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of today or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major parties as embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes\nThe the the fear back in the thirties was communism or the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more ...\nStay informed real news in real time amused talk five fifty KFYI\nRight [noise]\nOn the News I'm Carmen Robert Baer's debris flying around going to cause a lot of damage the low end out their\nHurricane Michael hit Florida like a freight train hurling in with one hundred and fifty mile an hour winds the strongest ever to hit the panhandle flattening trees ... and flooding straight surprisingly only one death reported it's tearing through Georgia now near Albany\nWe obviously are concerned it is on Nike and he's shown that we have\nHad governor Nathan Deal telling residents to watch out for each other Michael is weakening rapidly but still hurricane with wins as eighty five miles an hour President Trump's plane it up then Erie, Pennsylvania\nDemocrats or the party of prime he's\nOn the campaign trail pushing the party line and trying to drum up support for Republicans in next month's midterm election\nThis is Fox News [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd ...\nYou know if you look at the the civil unrest in America and you really look at the history you will find that it is almost always the left and in particular the communist or Marxist left\nThat is behind the civil unrest\nIf you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and in Sioux gets that's you know a a paragraph each but after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting\nRiots usually called strikes\nNow some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these\nCome from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first in the movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\nClan goes real resurgence and he was heavily involved in it ... to the military and it all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again in the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen onward\nThat's because of ... segregation and all of the things that a progressive\nPlanted alright but let me just go through and see if you can find any patterns here\nThe Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike May Day riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike any of those\nSeems a labor related I was less labor related doesn't it labor who I'm Sorry\nIf you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world\nOr the international workers' of the world that is of course are based in communist and Mars is it is the communist\nArmy here in America the international workers' of the world unite rise up against your oppressors\nYou also had in Nineteen sixteen the preparedness day bombing in San Francisco a you had a um [noise] uh you had read summer which was about twenty of them you hadn't made a riots\nYou had the scent trail you a massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing that was the last in communist saying you you can't get involved in the war because it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop\nThe best way to say that were icicles with a bomb bright this trail you a massacre if I'm not\nMistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization that was against a all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up\nRioting and killing people okay good then you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nIt's essentially it was a an industrial workers of the world and by ... thank you\nOkay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike do you even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth through October twelve\nThat one's shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle of the ...\nWe're past the republic steals strike almost all of these\nAnd including many of the race riots have communist and Marxist fingerprints on them\n\nI said it's is fundamental to the ideology right repetition is fundamental to the ideology is not surprising that this was happening again ... I just I'm\nIt was dying to vote no but we didn't give it to me the opportunity you went through and handle the situation right now having those on the Supreme Court handled well\nNow what's and what's the next level they're going to go out\nAnd it's I don't know we'll have to wait and see you seem to want to predict it an act on it now yeah and I'm I'm I'm not with you on that believe me I

mental illness can't stop can't stop a but I'm healthy compared to her\nI guess this ... this leads me to a bizarre question I Can't believe I'm asking my main radio but it's been gingerbread making a

I don't like the ... of all these holidays or we're going to be in one giant Christmas ... missing kind a holiday year round if we do say [noise]\nTop it\nGinger bread is for Christmas for Halloween Mm\nStay informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI\nBut I tell you um when pat first got simply safe I don't know what I was at about two years ago made it probably two years he got to because they were Jack in his you know his rate up to I think it was like sixty or sixty five bucks a month\nI think it was more than that I think it is over I think it was started at sixty and went up almost a hundred percent it was like ... over a hundred a month I think was it really it was crazy crazy I'm Out\nWhen you realize well here's what I Want you to do I want you to go to simply safe back dot com right now and I went to this girl down because they have a deal about how much money you're going to save over the next year\nWhen you look at what you're paying and then you look at what it costs to do simply safe which is far better far better know contracts no wires you owned the system\nFourteen dollars and Ninety nine cents a month or Ninety five cents a month it's unbelievable the savings and its top allies\nOn your right hand wringing and rent and program\nI Want to think and a stance or he is he's a guy that we had a book last hour and I\nKind of went in a different direction but I did it fits right in to what we have been talking about today I had a caller I'm about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back\nAnd we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the true and steady we have to speak truth\nDo not forget the things that we were all taught and\nWe all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but we were\nNot in a place where I think he grabbed the gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst ed stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is dance response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of\nPeople feel like I Know you are a lot of\nBuilt up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups\nRather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious [noise]\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged\nAnd they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts\nOpened we're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment to them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there challenges\nBut this is our moment and it in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now the views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe\nA better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream\nOf society where once they were the mainstream and that's\nKind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be ... by our cable news networks\nAs this I'll watch the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in
