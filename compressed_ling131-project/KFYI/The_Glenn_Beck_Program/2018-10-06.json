a game changing votes a of maybe his lifetime\nOr it will ... ... if if the Republican if the Republicans lose this it will set the standard of how everything else goes from here it will teach the left you can do this to anybody ...\nHow do you ... 'cause my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on do they still want to vote without his they may not or if they're fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's less let let's play the game though yeah forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to do we pass\nWell no well yeah I mean it but again let's say mentioned switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican so let's say ... forty nine were signifies today or that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow\nSo it's instead it forty nine forty now that it's not a sure thing you need Danes\nI've got to say like my it into a hardware that your gun was titled with my daughter but you know and the end you you really think that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was\nMy initial thought was this is really important I think of my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screwed this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't but your family can that can be move for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started it six started at three and I'll be there\nBut the ... vote right like move the vote you know there are planning on doing by the way if they need ... they're going to delay the holy until he comes back oh Gees delayed the vote well only if they need them right now that doesn't look like they need it we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty\nNine easy thing to do you could just ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow it to no\nNo they can relate to it on day yeah or easily yeah or Monday but there's a risk of like you know some new accusation during the crazy thing that happens you know what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding\n[noise] I'm fine thank you write it from Tehran time Inc you\nThat I'm a nine year old lady okay I'm five foot five and I weigh one thirty I Am my trauma man I Am a ... and and I cannot fresh food fresh vegetables and have it be\nBenched him off of it can only around how yeah OK and fresh fruit sugar okay All right and I yeah I I Know you're an exerciser to\nAnger my question what what you know we're not going to be Ninety years old like I had my\nAunt is eating jarred vegetables like baby food right\nLike that name you're eating vegetables like baby food puree read yeah I can they think you and your baby food and I'm like yeah I Would have that as your vegetables okay you know being your weight your height your age that's pretty dang good\nReally ...

right [laughter] okay you have a great weekend okay if you are here I'd give you a big hug from Mr Universe I give you can't [laughter] okay have a great weekend by by let's say\nLet's go next to Jeff Jeff or you\nKnow I like I just\nI'm a sixty nine year old Vietnam that about six years ago um I was diagnosed with Agent Orange uncontrollable diabetes and now I'm On and on three thousand milligrams of a of a ... a day and and lots of them for a novel logging\nAre are you overweight no I'm I'm not all but I don't think I'm overweight I'm worried about two hundred and five pounds ago they\nI'll tell you about fix one do you have that in your belly oh no I don't know what are the aid\nFor first off I like to say thank you for your service I really do I mean that I I I work I train or a number of Vietnam War veteran is one of them was exposed Agent Orange is well he's a diabetic is well okay we've got his blood sugar pretty much under control when he watches his diet and he wouldn't be considered overweight either\nOkay is about a hundred and sixty pounds\nOkay but he has a little pooch in his belly small one okay is about five foot seven five eight yeah but that's the only area they carries any fat so again if you're taking medications for that\nOr have insulin also met foreman okay you're probably are too high of a carbohydrate diet most likely and okay\nSo what I Would do just like we do with him is get those carbs down I Would get them ... forty fifty maybe sixty at the most a day but you need to watch your insulin your blood sugar because what happens if you're taking insulin alright your blood sugar can drop to low when you watch the carbohydrates\nAnd then you have to eat cops to bring it up so make sure that you get to your doctor if you start to do that and start to write down your blood sugars because then you may have to make an adjustment most likely in your insulin intake\nYeah okay it's going to take some is going to take some work on your part Jeff but you can get this down because insulin has a there are things that it can cause problems with All right\nWell I was wondering that you make a huge divide diets yes I Do okay that's\nGreat and work out and work out all that stuff is actually okay perfect or I'm off Monday morning okay Jeff take care of my friend immigrate week I think one of the um\nLet's see how many more minutes left\nThose\nTwo more minutes okay I'm In check my phone to see how many more people get a hold of me okay we had a handful of people\nThat see here let's see All right\nSo here's what I'm offering to anybody who calls between now and four o'clock\nWant to make these lifestyle changes like Jeff this second ago okay I specialize working with people over the age of fifty even though I have younger people over the age of fifty males and females like Web issues basically mechanical probably maybe joint replacements okay health issues\nWe do this we develop an exercise routine around them I Do that All right and we get to my my food plan which is lower carbohydrate base will give you an outline of the diets if you get involved with my diet\nAnd then you're going to be accountable and matter who you work with on our exercise routine in one of our centers you're going to be accountable to the my diet\nShe's teaching but what does she teaching with all the ranting she's doing what is she teaching hatred\n\nI feel bad for this woman I really do\n\nShe goes on these rants quite often by the way\n\nShe doesn't like Brett Kavanaugh she doesn't like President Trump\nWhy bring her up is well a\nTwitter are you going to kick her off are you going to kick her off\n\nIf this isn't if this if this isn't the epitome of threats I don't know what is\n\nWhat she really typified the [noise] the insanity that has overtaken the left no amount in evidence in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind and you know what I I I really\nI can understand how you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed with this on ending hatred and there's nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it\nYou're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check\nYep no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that you cannot know that\nI mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me judge less you be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves\nBut that requires evidence that requires some sort of of case to be made not accusations but a case to be made\nHere just drawing a person's life see here's the problem with this particular professor at Georgetown\nShe's looking for social justice\nShe's looking for wrongs to be a to B rice it somehow or another and it doesn't matter all men are guilty all men are guilty well I'm Sorry was gone be guilty was gundy guilty\nReally\n'cause he was a man was Martin Luther king was he guilty\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those women had things about them that I don't like both of those men uh they had one was a alleged land or\nThe other was a clear racist gundy I still think they were great men there were just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors when you go down that road you always always end up killing people\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her\nSaying\nWe should feed their genitals to the pigs tell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric and what a surprise once again it's coming from the elites in the universities\nIn the\nProgram\nIs really hard to really move very very hard to\n\nRemain [noise]\nReasonable when the world is unreasonable [noise] but we must\nWe must because no one will listen to any message if we are just hurling insults if we are fighting fire with fire it will change no one's mind if you don't believe me how many minds did we change\nDid we change the course\nOf two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monsters saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them\nIt's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\n\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just saw you're crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way and as I said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions\nBut what amazes me\nIs when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish\nYou do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others please don't do that to others who say you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are at least make in some sense please do not rubbed their\nOh well we told you so well really remember when you don't do that please don't do that will come them\nIf we're going to heal the nation the first thing we have to do is peel the right we're going to heal the nation we have got to put our differences aside and begin to open up our circle\n\nIf I Believe in eighty percent of the stuff you believe in grade I don't even need to do that I just need to know do you believe in the bill of rights do you believe in the bill of rights if you believe in the bill of rights and you'll stand for the bill of rights I'm In I'm In we can disagree on everything else I\nI'm November sick faith Native American families and jobs by voting no on prop one twenty seven twenty happened will hurt happens where\nHe's talking about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after arriving in Topeka he committed to reporters\nBeautiful thing is he is now when\nHe's going to be there for a long time and he's just an outstanding [noise]\nOutstanding scholar\nLawyer Bridget everything is ever done so we're very happy and the vote was [noise]\nIt was a great voted very historic vote that\nVote was fifty to forty eight the confirmation has been met by protests in Washington near the capital and the Supreme Court here chanting November is kind of [noise]\nSome arrests were made earlier about the courage cabin on has been sworn end but a ceremony is set for next week this is a ... [noise]\nWho else wants to discover how to invest in cash flowing apartments without dealing with a single tenant join us for a fast start to our free ...\n[noise] ...\nAt the Glenn Beck command All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check I'm Kevin ... which again I'm\nSo we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is\nYou know looking at some case before him and he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you this up in the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general would where are you doing one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's a certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this as a separation between the capital case in the house in case of the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference on\nA professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory and now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even since that there was a relationship of any sort between a word and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does\nShe ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nLike in their words case they both have a note from there do they get around those cases are the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now never named Kevin ...\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor new name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting me\nYeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forced she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening but people forward named cannot\nSay that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborate is your story in any way\nA key that once in a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um pictures\nAnd are those are things that she showed two co workers in real time real\nTime and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment off until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually yeah adviser Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... lives and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well you got your\nTape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the with the ... and ... and\nWe don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I think we ever became out more we have a preponderance of evidence in in the elephant case do however", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "06"}
