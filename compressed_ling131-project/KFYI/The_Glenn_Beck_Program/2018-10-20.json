I don't know uh it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... is the idea that he is put on every single sign solely\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be as a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him Beto but he's not he's not doing it because that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from his campaign serve stuff which that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now people pressed him on it he's obviously going to admit I'm Irish American man from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ads or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all he's\nTrying to be a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're ... you're not be F. K. okay we'll know who the F. K. was he's\nBeen gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F. K. and just stop trying to beat the F ... you're not him\nHe's working on it though it's dry and these these dry and I mean battle\nReal news in real time used talk five fifty KFYI\nFrom Michigan I

Monday we think right now he is a I I think he's he's climbing to write right this second yeah right I think they're getting their like their two thirds of the way to the summit\nThe second tier a highest peak in the world some people say if the highest in the most difficult to climb and we probably should have spent more time on the federal Glen Glen does not want to bring it up because you know he feels like it's bragging or whatever but yeah ... ... to this weekend you can follow his progress I I I Know there's a website I don't remember what the name of it is but if you kind of go on the search for\nA Glenn Beck climbing K. two it'll probably pop up\n... because I think they're doing this on the dark Web yeah a lot of thought last time he just you know some really put stuff on the dark Web uh so I don't I don't know maybe you'll have to find that there\nAre but we're we're ah we're here talking about a Beto O'Rourke a Ted Cruz and the Texas a Senate battle of people calling in and saying that they\nKnew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and then there's ... it just as it could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are\nUh you know from the different cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of look into as a possible cause for Beddoes a confusion here um there are issues however when you try to appropriate culture ...\nAh when you try to reach into some other uh cultural group and and and speak to them sometimes there are issues there was a case it is that the media is like ... is is like liking to highlight today\nA and it's a it's a commercial run on behalf of congressmen in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all although surely if you watch CNN Today he will be\nYou know blamed for it excoriated the hours are it's just some unrelated group running an ad in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance laws situation\nUm where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum which is completely unconstitutional to have in this country\nOr when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is an ad being run in Arkansas\nIt's a it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your call and whether you can detect anything seems a little odd to here I'm here as the ad from the group is supporting French all\nWhy do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may bring and the Republicans know that it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me that Democrats can do

obviously really make it yeah right well the point of\nAnd it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that\nYou know we we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just a Texas figure is because of this video he made\nAbout it's ... it's a great idea to Neal uh for the national anthem and what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the streets for no reason because ah for for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man of rape and we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race of mail but this is the type of thing that makes no sense\nI mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake

do it there is no no in my vocabulary\nJust like when people ask me how was your day to day last I said I have great days every day's a great day I'd never let it be a bad day I don't have that in my vocabulary\nEveryday is a precious day to me just I guess the pressures day in should be you and they have a ... day for you\nBe where you feel really good and you can do things comfortably without saying I may hurt myself I may hurt my back picking that up off the floor or I have aches and pains or I just don't feel good I'm tired all the time that lifestyle control in most cases\nNo I'm not telling you are going to prevent you from getting older because I Can't but you can slow the process down by doing the right things when it comes to your lifestyle and that diet and exercise that's called food into fitness\nFood and fitness those two things any health professional they will not argue with me on that fact\nFood and fitness is relevant to all of our wellbeing you want to be healthier as it's called heart disease or diabetes or cancer any of these sicknesses if you eat better and if you exercise your\nAnd I ended up killing one of these hey hey\nOr to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was really fun fun right hum he misses don't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took\nThe criticism we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there it's the big problem and I hope people continue to address\nIt a secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happened so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh early on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it's since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so\nOr it is OK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nAll the easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work\nProbably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week um my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same as you talk to hell in the other day yeah\nUh so I thought this was in in in the men's amount of work required learning these field very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work it was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of\nBackground in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I pay ... is the\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered her tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you at the un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers a and\nCredible way they got a little gold star for [noise]\nClaiming that\nThe police watch on demand\nThat the dot com slash TV you can watch every episode of for the record and watching the documentary one of those buildings ... house for terrorists coming to the actual facts human competition to\nLaugh at comedy like a wonderful woman to serve a Thursday to learn what they're talking about family friendly shows like Louie tree

dot com\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is bill football and enforce the law\n... which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about were dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we did it and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about\nHow ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we indicates\nThat we're human about dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could we know that as\nBeing ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little video\nWe've put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and going out [laughter] so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... ... ... what I mean\nYou got me man\nBut [laughter] I thought it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is wide\nBut but the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle and to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people\nPat phobic as they call it ... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity who wrote that who we claimed wrote that paper he actually has a professional body builder or Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this\nPaper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\n[laughter] 'cause that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean this kind of a is this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit not on who did it and so\nA lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in a district which was very common names on purpose I actually used\nA a a I roll dice to pick up a off of a list of\nMost common names for certain years and more that way they would blend in with lots of people\nHang on hang on

some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critique to no way that most people would um just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we are going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it does not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThere's instead he says this is our bank says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so loaded argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um\nThen the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to\nBe in a very privileged classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this\nSet of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temporary thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence teams and they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of be a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad\nEnough [noise] ah first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that you would expect out of a\nScholarly paper they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n... what what if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo the all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year so they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice side or the fields topics\nCourses I get the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was
