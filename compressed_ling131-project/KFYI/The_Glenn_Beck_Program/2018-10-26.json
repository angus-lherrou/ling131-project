Fox News federal and local authorities zeroing in on one state as they hunt for the person or persons responsible for ten suspected bombs at the high profile Democrats and other\nOf them have gone off and you took the time to print a medium that has the ISIS flag and underneath it\nIt's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says get her done\nExcept none of your bombs get it done none they they've had zero\nChance of making it through security screening and Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go piss dam road runner keeps going getting away maybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does\nEvery person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening Venus devices were not designed to kill\nBut to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny again there is no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know\nWhat he's doing there's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste\nBy noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what\nThis coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a\nLeft wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCan I ask when the president has actually called for violence now you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news is not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence\nYour electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business\nMaxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility\nOr Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the laughs narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over\nOr that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends and the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one\nTo deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapist to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters\nJust sent to the White House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just tap and don't forget\nAll about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old were you in twenty Seventeen he barely remember was I walking at that time\nI don't even know and as far as the identity of Wylie coyote for those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is I don't know there's\nNo evidence on any saying everything is speculation and if I Would say already ... versus a left wing person trying to ramp everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nBlaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility but you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility\nTo be able to gain it\nWell\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us that it is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I\nEat these Jason how ridiculous is this bomb\nThe most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it when I when we first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder\nAnd um I I was looking at it and I was like no not really\nI mean it's a plot you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel is what's dangerous and the ... the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need you [laughter]\n[laughter] right um but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it\nUm that they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything's spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is a you know and I've also spent some time and some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to them the coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication levels sophistication\nBecause he had sent a or she by the way he or she had a sense um some of these bombs to home offices and and residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely be\nSchool until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out and her bathrobe and are fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from [laughter]\nGet the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to that they didn't have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or still or service at their whole right\nThey get older male ...\nYou have private security you don't get\nYour money don't like we never opened our mailbox I remember one time my kids went to open the mailbox I said do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox\nMy clock is ticking every day you put

... you guys were blaming Trump and mocking Trump yesterday before all of the bombs were even found you were blaming it on him\nWithout CNN as it was really irresponsible his have gone over the edge they worked a target of this and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running a news organization ... he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there are words matter does far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThat is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't know like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence no evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fit into these bombings we have no idea\nWe have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a political motive but that's\nClearly a political motive but that's all you could say you don't\nKnow it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off the sticker the ISIS me right here are done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right why would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope God I'm Glad none of them went off by the way\nUm but it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we've just talked about a no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and ... like that because the postal service is not an exact science\nYou can't pay off his to point to our right at that time on timing\nTo you could've blown up the post in it so that there was a photo timer it when it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was was kind of funny is the wires were going into that with the wires dangling\nStay informed real news in real time used talk five fifty KFYI Mm\n[noise]\nOff News I'm ... it's absolutely ...\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio not and then the words about the ten packages sent a prominent Democrats than others\nBecause an effort to use violence or to make a political impact and that's the definition of terrorism\nPolice say two packages found at the time Warner building today we're full alarm federal investigators believe some of the packages may have been mailed from Florida they're not saying what did they believe the suspect recess faster in Florida operating from Florida or all packages were mailed from the state\nNew York and Maryland are also in Spokane success Catherine heritage to president sending eight hundred troops to the border\nTheir mission is clear to provide logistical support to the border patrol not combat power facts\nIs look at some length and the troops will head south within five days just a week before the midterm elections the caravan of migrants is shrinking in size ... still moving north\nMm\nGlenda and I'm just looking up on my a leftist anarchists cookbook a that was put out a\nBy the left in the Nineteen sixties and seventies about pipe bombs and you know it's really interesting is um\nUh it does show how to make one you know with the clock or but it also shows how to make them you know so they go off like let's say you open an envelope mhm you would pull a string in that era in that area which would make the bomb go off [noise]\nI'm I'm trying to figure out welcome to the program pat gray from pat gray unleashed um I'm trying to figure out what was the timer timing to\nEither this is the worst bomber of all time in human history or there's something else going on here\nBecause you why would you put up a sticker on a bomb like I ... I\nGuess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I guess in theoretically possible\nBut if you know a bomb going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and ... and less and less again potentially a you thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the\nRight wing meat yeah right like it's almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive\nSo all that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nFail and they'll put they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you want metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't put glass in the bomb would just\nDisintegrate the glass even more ... you you don't want it in PVC pipe you wanted in a metal pipe because of the shrapnel\nThis is just it's there's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... that was the end the stupid or it might be some kid that thought this would be funny it might be some\nYou know mentally deficient a right winger that did it it also may be somebody who was on the left is like oh I Know how to change the narrative\nCould be that two of quaint don't know\nI mean you have to have some level of skepticism of the of the of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you lead to that is it's not they haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing or figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think it's someone who is opposed to them but\nWould take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be rights and and just white powder\nWide someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievable someone just listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point but you see these statements that have come out\nFrom CNN and ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe right and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how well no but I think of ... of [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that but beyond that if you're going to you\nYou have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right they could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault\nYou do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\nAnd I have to tell you and will continue that at the top\nOf the hour and a mass grave from ... unleashed a pre seeds this program on the blaze radio network and then also you can get him on line wherever you find your

relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain\nQuite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to\nAging exercise and everyday living\nLet me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or\nPlaying golf for tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of

more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to go to release factor\nDot com [noise]\nAll right so the White House ah as\nA reported that uh\nWe now have another bomb that was found and that was to a Mike Pence vice president Pence and\nA second package or to vice president Joe Biden was ah found this morning or the Delaware postal facility but you know another reason why I guess you put a timer on those things I mean it's just it's so this is so bizarre\nAgain none of them have gone off they they intentionally exploded I think the Soros one um to make sure that you know they ... the police did\nUm but ah listen to this this is again we're supposed to be there's a high level of sophistication of these bombings ... someone actually said it was the biggest mass uh assassination attempt er we've seen in some time yeah about\nA year or because you just had and they actually like almost killed someone in Congress and I'm a baseball field they just completely forget about this moment but listen to this this is these are the labels Debbie Wasserman Schultz S. H. U. L. T. Z. incorrectly spelled Florida F. L. O. R. I. D. S.\nNiceville, Florida rent and B. R. E. N. A. N. two ends saw grass or to or should be one word or and left out to\nThe word street on whole holders label solve a Fox was younger it shows the level of sophistication\nOr or not or not\nThis guy it was just based on the spelling\nPossibly foreigner or more wrong\nYeah very well could be more on just seeing how he built to bomb yeah I'm leaning towards more on\nYeah I like I don't know\nRight that's the important thing but it's going to be so many people speculating about this I just think you can't jump to conclusions there's going to be a massive investigation over this I don't know why this is so much of a bigger story than you know rice and being sent to right wing figures a week or two ago\nI've got a gas or whatever it's honestly this is going to last longer and be bigger than what happened on the baseball diamond over a year ago yeah it well and that one was\nSemi successful I mean the guy was firing shots almost killed somebody\nStay informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI Mm\nFor more than three years of software vulnerability and the Google Plus social media network unwittingly gave a third party developers potential access to users private

shared the data a competitor data accessed we see this happen over and over again criminals can open accounts file tax returns by property uh from some data exposure that tiny and there's so many threats and today's connected world it takes just one weak link for criminals to get it\nDo you think Megan Kelly was sitting there going oh man\nThat's you know what you know it today show I'm going to bring up that lady Diana Ross and I'm just going to cause people paying she says thanks for listening and helping me listen to no\nNo I didn't hear it I don't know what was said to you all fair there is a lot of people in the audience that probably said yeah I mean they don't mean offense how is this\nHow is this a problem how is this a problem well we don't know we just know shut up apologies aren't good enough anymore they're not good enough\nDoesn't matter where in the throes of cultural lawlessness\nExecutions on demand contacts commonsense doesn't matter execute them hang them getting rid of them I\nGuess what's happening next\nShe dropped by ca I think she was dropped by her talent agency she's a pariah now\nShe's a pariah and people will say on the right good really good good\nPeople on the left will say good how Megan Kelly affected anyone's life well she has made it very difficult for\nNBC to live down their sexual harassment and assault that's been going around their offices she keeps bringing that up she was very serious and one of the biggest critics of NBC and the way they handled some of those allegations seemingly they are really finding a a quick way\nOr they seems to me to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those are things that she said\nWhich is kinda fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know that they're going to do good to talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and and how how those conservatives are really about Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy\nA but we're going to find that when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's when one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all that goes on and making Kelly happens to be one of the biggest critic of what happened at NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone it's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can damn those remarks\nThere is no place on our air or in this work place for those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I add that quote it's a very unfortunate and quote\nWhat is unfortunate is that America has devolved into a country of oversensitive cry babies who\nTake offense at the slightest thing and you know what I don't even think it's America\nDon't think it's Americans I really don't I don't think that it's a vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country that are cry babies they're sick of this\n\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics and the last place probably\nThe last comes first academia [laughter]\nYou should be coddled\nThe slightest thing upsets you well that's not American it's not we are the ones you don't want I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains and in a um a in a ... a wagon train okay\nIs she was she looks like me an address with a bomb it okay\nShe she ... she also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\nYou know she did she wiped her face and ... and kept going she didn't wine she cry about it she's like\nOh crap [noise] shouldn't around with that\nI poked my eye out and she moved on\n\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on that yes people say things that I don't like ... on that yes\nThings have changed were involving we're learning new things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\nMegan Kelly ought to know that blackface is awful yes\nIt's no longer acceptable but you know what if it's a costume that his purpose\nFlea ridden a ridiculing race as black faces done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly ... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words\nAnd I the ah question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people why is this wrong that\nThat person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong\nI think that deserves an answer instead what we got was an apology\nI Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be\nYeah I don't want another whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me how are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river\nIf she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that\nWill know that she was innocent this is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't sort of there's something called a book in a while\nOkay now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember I don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny and Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television\nEpisodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they they have a situation where they all wake up what after like getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know then the animation but it's still the same types of things happen because they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he he's that they're not trying to be racist or not starting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who think they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd they don't want to stand up comics right you want to be black yeah right they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well and you think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true we may say\nAs a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation is not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her gig over that I mean it's just completely insane and we're not adults if we can handle that level of conversation Mm\nStay informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI\nControl [noise]\nFox News on crime and the

that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department of state chasing the big workout ...\nWith Mexico oh whereby a Mexico would require people who enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were coming from\nWith the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed by the EU refugees are arriving in ... countries from Syria in other words\nWhen people were fleeing a a a a country that dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular racial such that they have an asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum and the first country they reach that could be potentially save your that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum I thought\nI personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy and apply for asylum\nI I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it\nWorks and that ... ... in order to these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico they're sort of going for the long bomb ill Mary pass and tried to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous this journey itself\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited\nAh it it's an exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and\nFor young women many of whom are sexually assaulted during the ... and a lot of the people claiming asylum turn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum\nBut once they're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the asylum application that they're coming by land for Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a another potential magnet agree praying people here um if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at this creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native in Honduras\nSaid been following the news or on the caravan here locally or been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud you and your
