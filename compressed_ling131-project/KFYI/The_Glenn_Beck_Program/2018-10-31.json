October surprise on his investigation is all popcorn and peanuts and the conservative circus [noise]\nEnjoy your evening you listen to those top five fifty KFYI\nAn eighty seven we are those valleys talk station is used dogs five fifty why Phoenix Jay y o da de do Phoenix and I are the radio station [noise]\n\nUsing executive power I leave says the camera Fox News President Trump considering ending a policy where children born in the last two parents who are illegal immigrants are automatically us citizens Democrats slamming the plant\nWhat do you call a group of people two thousand four thousand seven thousand strong marching to a border saying you're going to cross whether the country wants your not while carrying another country's\nFlag what what what do you call that [noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming\nThe reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one\nThere will be an invasion\nBecause America can control our own borders\nMerely eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\n\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing\nThat men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop\nUs because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there now if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house\nYou want the police to do nothing would you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just said you know what they're not common for you know cute they they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house\nOh please I don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I shouldn't be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders the new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act are truly examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures that's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door and stops all of the side windows and the back door and trees\nThe country needs either serious policy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\nBut I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and to fall when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program direction by numbers let's\nTake a look at election by a numbers fellows do\nTell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get ... with the chart a little bit because we have had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category yep I'm pulling spend close and now we start to\nTry and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri and Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz is still lean Republican state\nAh and ah ah Mississippi and North Dakota are you going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss ups still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls for Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points plays falling has a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tossup category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race cars you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen a movement towards about but towards the Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one as a lean democratic state um we moved from Minnesota as well from faith Democrat to leaning Democrat polling there [noise] you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling it's closer than I think most people expect there's two reasons in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well\nOr with a tossup races for most of the time it looks like tester has not enough of a lead there to consider this one to be leaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got a New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot of started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction it is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida was discouraging I think for Republicans to the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big hope for pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points\nAnd Joe mansion I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kevin Olival yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay Republican ... ... I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now or it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house\nFrom Lexington by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr don't want to tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's filtered by a filter by is a great service really truly a great service\nI I'm going to be honest with you I've ... I've I'm I'm uh fifty\nThree fifty four year old ban a love of beat I've never gone and bought a filter to change the filter no matter I've owned house after has never changed it you've never changed it in your life never\nI just did adjusted first time because the filter by yes I'm soldier by is just a way to it's a way to like skipped the responsibilities of being a man he's yeah the veil just do they just send it\nTo you so you don't have to remember ... and I know with you you just had your wife do it\nNo I actually went well well well I mean it's there I was there\nOkay well I ... I took the filter I took it from the front porch and I said honey where the hell are the ... where do we change that filters\nAnd she said I think it's up stairs\nAnd so she went to one direction I went the other direction\nSome might say I knew it wasn't in that closet mhm um and ah interesting\nAnd so then she ... and so she found it and she pulled the other one out and I'm like\nOh great well here's the new one and she put that ... you know ... does well so you were there I was there well it's interesting when Osama bin Laden was killed fellow al\nYeah and I would say if anything it's that the road is a little bit more up hill than it was still a week ago um you know it was interesting someone made a election analyst made this point of it it's an interesting one\nProbably the most calm and can under control that Donald Trump was in the entire election was in the last couple of weeks\nIf you remember he gave Hillary nothing nothing after that tape came out right that was probably a month before the election last three weeks he gave her nothing\nShe had nothing to say he was crazy on he was I mean as rock solid has he has been as under control is he's been no crazy tweet none of it he didn't play any of those games like you said the election and that's when he closed the entire gap down by eight in the polls are so ah when after the the tape came out and closed it to\nA much ... you know tighter margin and wound up winning obviously\nYou know it's funny that seems to be going the other way with right now I mean like he's talking obviously about a lot about the they're talking about a potential uh executive order to end birthright citizenship he's talking about\nUm he's been more aggressive right and that that may be good and may not be good we're going to see right now\nI don't think it is I think you know look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump and then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm I'm happy with the way things are going but I'm not thrilled with Kevin you can you just\nHelp me as a citizen I just feel like everything is normal you know what I mean ... and he reminds people at a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need\nThat makes sense ah yeah I think that's probably true because he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to get continued a dog pile and and quite honestly I I Wish he would stop the\nPresses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a a I mean it they're out of control\nBut that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable I think\nWe have to also back up and say that this is not just the just the Trump election right office in election for individuals in individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate were you know there's a lot of storylines that could decide it\nI think the issue a overall however uh there's a\nThe momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more movement a as dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean it doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out\nUm it's just it's not you'd hoped to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the ... like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run for\nTrump in Denver and Republicans remember they you know\nA month before but I'm an eight or nine points they close that gap all the way almost\nWould pose a so it was not a the momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously he won here it's a little bit it's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaning that would\nGet out and vote do not sit this election out get out and vote Mm\nDe informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI Mm\nRight [noise]\nSome skill NATO President Trump\nMet with protests today in Pittsburgh has he tried to offer support in the wake of Saturday's massacre at the tree of life synagogue\nThe streets were filled with people chanting and holding signs reading messages like go home Trump into words matter they say the commander in chief there's some of the blame for Saturday's shooting specifically his recent declaration of being a proud national is the president and first lady honored Jewish Barrow tradition placing small stones of white markers outside the synagogue\nFox's Garrett penny in Pittsburgh busting gangster Whitey Bolger killed Tuesday in West Virginia prison the Boston Globe's reporting on cello inmate with mafia ties is being investigated for the dad meanwhile Tommy Donahue the sound of one of Bulger's victims says no no\nHe didn't but actually it's a peaceful ...\nBolger was serving a life term for multiple crying [noise] this is fine [noise]\nExactly and that kind of an [noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr path grey who ah precedes this program on the blaze radio and television networks a and also has his a podcast that you can listen to and download at your leisure ... welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem\nWell problem it's an executive order I agree with though [laughter]\nSo you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] isn't that the justification yeah it is a justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged parts and then it would go to the Supreme Court which\nFinally okay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens hell you know what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a read a ration\nIt's just to reiterate or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to pay for that right on the thirteenth\nAmendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and they get I'll stop it yeah here the ... the ... literally Democrats knock it off mhm yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know a sneaking in cross having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here ludicrous that what that was\n... and so it's what I meant interpreted now all this time right but you can't you can't you do it with an executive no but if he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court on kind of okay with it yeah\nAnd that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just because I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like\nMore than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be internally there is yeah I think that would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this than with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not if it's gonna be fascinating to edit does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and ah\nAnd Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court just come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh\nReally I mean you can usually come with a Pittsburgh shooter and say no really he did it he is really really bad\nYou know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media\nAnd a lot of the Democrat leadership tried to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish president we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've gotten here's here's Joe Scarborough and what she had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise]\nPeople get to make a decision is is the America they want to live in because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a point to have your guy really a guy who was sending a message\nBy time and time

baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nNot that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know so twisted they well and that's from a ... a hard core conservative yeah showed our daughter oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not I mean\nIt'd be you know gas something yeah I mean that I mean as a dog was we all know it man\nAnd with the exception of your weight you've been very consistent um\n[laughter] I [laughter] I mean if the head of the more\nBizarre attacked and it's a little path brought this up when we're out there a minute ago is every criticism of going back a criticism of the Mormon church\nYeah right is that what they're doing they're attacking Mormons yeah I mean ... this is how idiotic that point\nIs you can be critical of the top progressive financier as a conservative without hating Jews had nothing to do is wait on your job since George Soros is an atheist [laughter]\nHey\nI I mean is it is absolutely incredible first of all the number one person on the ah on the death list for Jews you know the most targeted you in America is Ben Shapiro men Shapiro well Ben Shapiro now\nThe Trump people love Ben Shapiro I mean most conservatives do conservatives love Ben Shapiro we don't like George Soros so how do you weigh that\nOne but in policy based it policy but and they know it they know they say they're doing the same thing as they were doing with a ... when you said wait a minute socially he's a socialist you're a racist for saying that you don't let this work doesn't make any

five fifty KFYI um\nFor about four years really factor a kind of came into the world here at the blaze with a lot of people are dealing with serious pain a pain that was kind of constant uh there were mainly like\nSports injury you know old sports injuries you know like years getting huge show you my natural huge yeah and you add some inflammation a all over your body is called fat okay as ... but even that you really had a serious problem and and you're not alone here and you took really factor and it's been a huge difference in your life\nLooking at it to look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialists now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist\nNow when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite that's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\n[noise] I did I did and they basically taken the position that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is is a homo phobic\nAnd it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so and my wife is Mexican she's a first generation\nOr you know a ... a Mexican American ... it's ... they use this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that attack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late\nLast waning and you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided that only tell one side of the story\nSo you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that\nSo that's what I ... it was it was astonishing\nKind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on is purely because we're conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that the what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by\nSo few people and it was just such a fear for losing work and\nOne way and it and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where they're it it's very competitive to to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of the conservative\nUm and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets distinctive among conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very the unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know uh and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking his anymore you see the rating start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new friends here for conservatives where we need to start creating content for ourselves\nAnd we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red tailed America that's on the eye heart radio a pod cast or cheating on her radio [noise] excuse me I heart radio at\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you I'm Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly and thought while she's a great get she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own kind of sixty\nMinutes [noise] kind of person\nI'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for
