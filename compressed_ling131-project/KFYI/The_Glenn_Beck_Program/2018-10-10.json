were yesterday\nHave you found any answers or are you only shouting things down\nOr you just out in the street directing traffic\nBecause you feel it's your right well have you even look at what your rights mean where do your rights even come from\nToday I saw I think progress write a whole article about how the constitution has failed that was the headline the constitution has failed\nAnd then\nIt goes on to explain how it is really a slavery document\nAnd the three fifths in the constitution all lives all lives\n\nNow you can argue that or we can begin to teach our children you can argue that\nAnd you can throw it back in their face with some sort of ... your\n\nName calling of some sort\n\nHere's the question that we all have to answer is America a force for good or a force for bad that requires\nReal thought and discussion\nBecause it is neither in my opinion it is both\nIt has been a force for bad and I warn you if we leave the bill of rights we will become\nThe darkest force ever on earth with our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies make no mistake\n\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people we freed blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWe brought to free the Germans and all of Europe and the world we fought to free Russia from the tyranny of communism and we failed in the time of peace\n\nAre we good or are we bad is the declaration of independence still a viable mission statement because that's all that is the declaration of independence is a mission statement period\nDo we still hold these truths to be self evident forget about the past let's talk about\nThe future we have never ever reached\nThe heights demanded by our mission statement\n\nBut have we gotten better is it's still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self evident\nThat all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance\nDon't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nDo you have\nDo you have everything the baby lane next to you as when you were born\nAs far as human rights and dignity\nDo you still believe that\nAnd I'm not talking about well it's not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's bribes and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw got into it too I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than manned\nThe reason why the creator is important\nIs if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away rights so if you want to see the moon but he's turning to ease the great cause most whatever\n\nBut he didn't ... each of us with certain on changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more and that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this\nAs an aspirational statement we're only talking about the past\nWe're talking about the mistakes of the past\nCannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying where we're going\nSo where are we going to fall you want to terrorists down there now I read your website I read your mission statement I strongly disagree\nCapitalism is not the problem capitalism that is that has no morals sentiment is but you don't fix that by a state run economy\nBy co ops it's always fails\nNo you and your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for\nIt's a failed system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer a means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\n\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do as was\nTold to me by a very powerful individual ones look land we all believe in the constitution but the you know you gotta do what you gotta do no\nNo\nYou do not to do what you have to do that the ends justify the means we either believe in this or we do not and that is the question America do you believe\nNeutral half assed not sought out\nSitting on the sidelines all of those answers I mean nothing in the end\nOnly those who know it who understand it who have done their homework who can intellectually defend it\n\nThose are the winter soldiers those will be the ones that restore freedom for all mankind\nEverything else is lip service the game and actually a tool in the hands of those who wish to create chaos and destroy all we have\nAnd and and and ... and\nBen monologue so much more is actually the beginning of part three of my book addicted to outrage finding our moon them what

the Democrat Party\nOr or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left has their own a party members they\nWork every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media and being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a pulled over for the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nAh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and ... year people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violent view see and to ah\nThe way to answer and so far is not with uh the\nMilitant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets\nThat is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country\nWith those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility\nYour kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and say no wait don't don't go that way you're not going to stop the whole crowd but you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a book\nOr let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHi Glenn how are you I'm very good [noise] um I overall I agree\nWith every book I think it's awesome I Want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess\nOkay you're you're um you're\nTalking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all of a job than and I know you don't necessarily agree with the idea that you've said that we need to at least have a conversation about\n... because of it yeah and I\nYou know I think we need to be careful about even\nConsidering heavy I I think that there really is a fear over a I to try to come in and Institute ... yeah it's I think that they want to push that sort of socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical right on ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that tight and I'll do it's going to come and direct place their ... their problem correct and\nSo um I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create the\nMachines and keep the running you know there are certain things I just can't they don't like I'm being a ... a leak in your plumbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think many people are going to be upset if they go into McDonalds and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet isn't known for their service\nAnd I ... that let me ask you this let me ask you that's first of all just a ... ... ... I don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know\nUm how up to speed you are on this um or or what books are you reading on a on a ... or or you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general that cannot than safe work unless I'm sound coming just ... you know a different perspective\nOr not having to sit there for a church that I Know that you have sure on that\nBut you know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely be able to diagnose cancer um quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so have there are there is a there is and I can't remember the name of it on the uh on this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why I'm a that that we don't connect with robots is ...\nBecause they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but a while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that true a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to go through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal\nThan anyone else the bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and the history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today you started your comment about the section of the book where I uh there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income\nI Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington\nI'm Talking about the people who are studying or the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hit high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent\nThe interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty it's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid

you for your call I I wouldn't he is going to be impeached or they take the house he will be impeach ag will not necessarily be removed because they need to take the Senate as well but he will be

good about Adolf Hitler\nOr the Audubon the Audubon okay doesn't really our balance our way the other but oh okay\nYou can't find anything and I compared the news coverage to a bunch of people who are just telling you that everything about McDonald's sucks\nEverything if they don't mention that they okay but I got to tell you the price of the best fries ever if they can't admit that McDonalds fry
