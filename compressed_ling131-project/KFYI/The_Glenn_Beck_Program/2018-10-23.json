I'm going to negotiate a better deal well ... what how exactly are you weren't to negotiate that what magic wand do you have ten years later the answer is you don't have an answer\nIs is this supposed to be so embarrassing so hard for\nFor Obama because the most president they just go away they just go away\nI think bill was the first one that kind of hang around with Jimmy Carter came back he came back 'cause he was like building houses and stuff to charity but here you have Obama happened to come back and tried to take credit for something that he had not thing to do with\nAnd then he has to come out and say you know we have to clean up on on the Republican mistakes were mistakes and you're talking about cleaning up ... what oh we're going to repeal the tax cut\nOh oh are we going to impeach a cabinet oh oh oh\nFormer president for rock Obama\nIf you don't like what's going on right now and you should don't complain don't\nDon't do very\nTired rhetoric old rhetoric if you don't like what's going on right now and with Trump unusual but what does or not to like before we before we closed the big top today's let me just say this uh Cory Booker is in trouble here the\nAnd Republicans got smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested\nOnly forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats\nStarted to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate ... ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... cents Kavanaugh that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen even if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively are relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican law in the house where they would lose a couple of seats\nUm there is a you know if you look at kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split it's going to be important here but just that get them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way they these models they're all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still gonna have investigative power and have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of oh\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance at this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that look like leaning Republican we're all toss up or in some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat they had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real ... going\nTo come to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent independents are\nAlmost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like typically I'm that type of course a blanket role but it's typical I'm into doesn't fourteen was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever the entire life I was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... that I mean I Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything\nThey don't like the overall system there's one other interesting just out of here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um a Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense night in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen itching to Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it's going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow\nControl [noise]\nSounds he'll NATO as a caravan of some seven thousand\nMigrants make their way through Mexico towards the U.S President Trump that in Texas rally calling for tighter border security we need the president's been calling the march national emergency for the U.S meanwhile former President Obama at a rally of his own in Nevada also addressing immigration there's\nNothing American about ripping immigrant children from their mothers\nPresident Trump's been saying he's ready to cut off American aid to Honduras Nicaragua and El Salvador where most of the migrant marchers there from will and now a category for hurricane heading towards Mexico's Pacific coast with wins that one hundred and fifty miles an hour it's supposed\nTo move north and several inches of rain on tax day\nI [noise]\nTalk a little bit about [noise]\nThis back and forth with Saudi Arabia because it is important that we get this right and we don't make this about American politics we should make this about American interests but not American politics\nRight now people are saying I came away Donald Trump or\nYou know what George Bush Bill Clinton the second George Bush all the way back all the way back to FDR we have been in bed with the Saudis\nI don't like this I think we're in bed with really bad people\nHe's a rattlesnake a bad pet\nThat was asked me once and I love this is a rattlesnake is it a bad bad the answer is no it's a perfectly fine pet\nAs long as you always remember it as a rattlesnake or a snake and not a little puppy dog\nIt's a rattlesnake ... not a bad bet just don't have it and don't try to a fashion Elise ... around its neck take it for a walk it ain't gonna do it\nSo how do we handle Saudi Arabia well should be the same way we handle turkey but we're not because we're looking at turkey and Saudi Arabia with American eyes stop it\nThese are both Islamic states now their warring with each other why\nBecause one is Muslim Brotherhood and one is a well hobbyist they don't like each other they want death for everybody in the other state\nThey want the regime of Saudi Arabia [noise] Saudi Arabia stopped [noise] turkey because they're Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd Saudi Arabia wants turkey stopped because there will hobbyists we're\nBeing put in the middle of a fight between to Islam assists both of them want the caliphate both of them want Islamic rule both of them want to rule uh with jihad and they also want to rule which surreal law\nWe don't we don't want any either of those\nSo now let's put this into perspective Saudi Arabia horrible place horrible horrible horrible horrible place they execute kids\nAs long as you've shown any kind of signs of puberty you're tried as an adult they execute through beheading\n... there was a woman who was raped gang raped by seven men not sure if one of them was Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh yet a about a Saudi were woman was gang raped by seven men\nThey each God you know between two and nine years in prison however she she received six months in prison and two hundred lashing ... with a whip\nBecause she was in the car without a without her husband and then she dared to take her story to the media is the kind of people that we are dealing with\nThe crown prince you and I are not going to like this guy you didn't say oh look what he's still he's he's making it easier for women to drive without their husband yeah okay yeah sure sure sure he's still a lobbyist\nLet's look at what\nBoth sides in this country have done [noise]\nWe're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia we are involved in their war in Yemen did you even know that President Trump announced a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year\nIt was President Obama that vetoed a bill that allowed families of nine eleven victims to sue the Saudi Government\nSo\nBoth sides everybody is in protecting these guys when the crown prince came here to America he met with Donald Trump\nOh my gosh but he also met with Oprah Winfrey bill and Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer\nDwayne the rock Johnson for some unknown reason Brock Obama John Kerry ... rice George W.

something of him on the view and he's\nReally not being given the time to talk and explain especially Kavanaugh\nMe said yeah it was for her and then I saw the additional one hundred and forty people the FBI interviewed and there were severe problems\nTo um as far right as they come on the right versus left continual but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and build\nA better mouse trap or app or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nThey are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to\nNancy Pelosi and California hunter hunting arena where does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly ...\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up and violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do but screaming someone down\nTaking mentioned Elaine's food off their table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually\nHave persuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rant a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking a beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and are there is no anti ...\nHair and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about anti ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy\nSo that it was sixty percent of households that met an ... basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it\nWas shared content ...\nThere was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still\nReally only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope\nFor a viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring them [noise]\nSo what he is are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... a a blurb assuming I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion\nFreedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe a ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity that's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this\nTension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature if you will out there is confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe\nThat we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships\nAnd the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben Sasse\nHis new book is called them why we hate each other and how do you feel [noise] our sponsor this half

my life that way and I needed to be able to be out of pain what am I going to do my wife finally said 'cause I'm\nI'm a weirdo I don't believe in the odds a hundred per cent drug free oh really so

they're just bad at it\nThe real reason we need to take that Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team often I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about um gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns\nLike Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the for Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're\nGoing to have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings were all of a sudden audio will appear of Schumer strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying art as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there is actually national security exposure for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere in McDonalds right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of not pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues

I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system\nI'm making hemp and the candidates legal I hang up before it surely some stuff started without me I should go into education absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school I Know in talking about doing that because ... testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests or the feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and try and why you should go where your book liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why it's to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in the school prior to Nineteen eighty and almost I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information ... ... really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write survive in the world\nWithout and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school districts that a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want I Want to make sure that we have some localized central I'm the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators\nBecause here's the problem with getting really sad and I was testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we lose about four billion dollars in federal funding it's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we all lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators\nGo away and then it shows what writing grants diminish shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I crossed the entire state might say that the the two counties across all if you do the full sharp by the way\nFor you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than a traders than teachers the average teacher and that's a shameful by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminish ... over a hundred and fifty\n... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve ... K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college west terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job\nIt is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one ... told me he says Larry my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a house for a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college\nThe problem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and for a new computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year ... to ... is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator as life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr them teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who ... not sure about the new Dr ... being a female but that's a different\nStory down okay yeah [laughter] so um so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and gets into your degree why should they be bored in school and they shouldn't be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things no worries go to a two year trade school go to trace could become a plumber carbon do whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I Love my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and Yossi to doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation that came here to go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth grade I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHere's an here's why I promise is going to happen\nBunch of cool prep schools will pop up\nBunch of great trade schools will pop up yes how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going to say well I don't know they'll pop up\nBecause it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when he schools pop up now is spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... states spend twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand lemons fourth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe've said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at at at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids ... now thinking about this lemon twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo build their kid isn't there the bully cage and something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's the bully but now he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade discipline problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught\nWas killing our children isn't guns was going to have children as lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that killing our kids put them in these worlds all that goes away I Can't go shoot my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class I Can't go ... the farm and\nHe's going to fix a tractor I've got things to do I've I've purpose I

his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system or you know that feels like the old Soviet\nSize styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... ah and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit\nEspecially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to de platform or people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally an ethical for governor to impede business\nPeriod no ... no ... if I don't like an industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief\nNot not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing three out of it is he's always not only\nDoing that he's also threatening another group of businesspeople but you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around it eat X right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance force firearm now we can't get it\nThere's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more well how do they need insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nFor any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default matter what you do that's how it works in the state you're\nTurning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passed and twenty Thirteen and if a fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent fell and it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops who are said to revamp the because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire when you're a felon again\nBecause you know an activity cop\nThis and this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy and constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a business man\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over a million since he's attended thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nWhen it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they have pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we really we literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah the youth you're going to break all
