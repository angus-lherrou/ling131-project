so\nI'm Jason is a guy who watches a international affairs for us and I am fascinated by this story of ... a from a from Saudi Arabia\nA and I want you to bring me I Want you to bring me the news that no one in the news is reporting on this but let me bring everybody up to speed if you haven't been following this guy in a nutshell he worked for the Washington Post he's a\nRevered ribs veered reporter\nWhich makes me ... suspicious immediately but he's a revered ... a a reporter Washington Post he is a Saudi citizen\nHe was over in Turkey he's going to get married and so he's like I Need my divorce papers from the embassy and so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy\nHours and hours and hours going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out she calls the embassy and they say oh\nNo he left he left just the oh he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside well I'm not sure if he went out time bill did he go out the front door yes\nSo bill and the other guy mock moods says yes he went out the front door well CCTV cameras show that he didn't ever leave the Saudi embassy at least by the front door\nSo [noise] the next thing we find out this was yesterday as the Saudis um the Saudi prince\nLands of gulfstream his Gulf Stream it at the airport there I'm In turkey about an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty suitcases they piled up in the back of the vans they're driving to the embassy they decide for some reason or another they need more empty suitcases they buy some more empty suitcases\nThey also stop just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed at the embassy but they needed a bones saw [laughter]\nBy your boat saw Oh thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the bones saw God only knows what they do in the embassy but they're seen leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them into the back\nOf the van they throw them on the jet and the jet takes off\nMeantime the United states says we do have a we do have\nA an encrypted a messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to in trapping more tried to trap and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia\nA and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have either given to the United states or shown the United states this video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned\nAnd then tortured and then murdered\nWe don't know if that is true but that's the latest today so ... we're going to find out who this guy is and was possibly ah when we come back because this is the part of this story that no one surely\nCNN and Christiana autumn poor would want you to have this information will give that to your next [noise]\nLet me tell you about our Palm Beach letter taken to Ari is cryptic course Ninety seven percent of the people who take his crypto course give it a four or five star rating and these are people that range from you know people like me I didn't get into crypto currency 'em\nAt all because I thought I don't know when I listen to our in effect a and a Warren Buffett said\nDon't do that or no no don't ever invest in something that you don't understand\nIt [laughter] I thought you act like that's bad advice that's actually really good advice [laughter] it really is crypto currency is that for some stuff\nThat is happening now like do you understand you really understand AI in AG ins I Know yeah no I think you're ever going to probably not right are you going to invest in it absolutely\nRight I can I just gambling quantum mechanics because okay let's go to the quantum computing field I they don't even understand [laughter] okay right so it's kind of those things\nAnyway so for people like that but I don't understand it at all to people who kind of understand it this is a place for you to go and learn what block chain is what crypto currency is why it works why it why it\nReally appears to be the [noise] the pathway to freedom in the end I think everybody should have a hundred dollars in bitcoin um I Believe but that's just me I Want you to go to take this course go to um a\nSmart crypto course dot com that's smart crypto course dot com Manama good broadcaster every good broadcaster does this uh\nThis is why we need AI because when we can just replace us where people actually so much better robot that can just communicate hey man some level of will just find some Google algorithm that will just mhm help help that AI be just like a\nSmart crypto course dot com that smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven ... back for more information eight seven seven PBS back smart crypto course dot com [noise]\nHe's actually that's the reason why he's not in the people in the media have said oh well he spoke out against\nYou know the uh the the king dome the Saudi kingdom and that's probably why they don't like him\nNo kitten but it goes way beyond that like he they support a political Islam group that\nWants to overthrow the monarchy it's a lot goes a lot further than ... spoke out against them yeah he is the public in public enemy number one but he's right up in that group with them um and they was friends with the crown prince thought was he not um\nI don't know how they're framing it he was friends he was he was he loved the crown prince they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies and that's where they want us to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia\nBasically that's the best way to put it for this guy\nBut he's a he's not a good guy he wants to political Islam he wants to political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work at Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm On the other hand you have this one guy that's not that great of a guy on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who everyone is and this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leader is going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling he they dug\nPlain and simple he is a Doug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of their lives he has a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social unrest about to hit the street if you want to see the place for the next ah Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia the the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised\nRight all so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug you can't I mean it's like Russia really either right groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part ... most likely most likely\nThis guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and then maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible for a while\nMay be doubtful here's the problem\nWe are ... we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that we should not be doing that that should it be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood\nNow we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and there are probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys yeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but ah it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate\nHave at it yeah and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's businesses and stay out of their business\nKind of like a production yeah so I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame of very familiar a photo and they'll say it's\nThe deep state the beach they did this no shelter salmon

this stuff tell me about the press and the numbers\n[noise] okay so what's happening is not just in cable news but it's in all kinds of TV watching is that the machines are now overwhelmed the American public your device so whatever you call it the ... started it they don't watch television anymore um my kids used to they don't anymore\nAnd NOW News consumption is following in that regard so people are getting used to the fact that Bill O'Reilly dot com is there the blazes there that can get whatever they want twenty four seven I'm so why do I have to sit there and wait for some show to come on that's the under fifty five set in America\nOver fifty five they still like their martinis they liked the courts or say like eight o'clock knowing that somebody is on right and they had then but they're starting to get bored\nWith it back because if you watch it it's not being the same thing said over and over how many times can human being said the phrase at the end of the day we're now at fifty\nTwo million times on cable news alright it just\nIn sip it or to the day and sip it um and you you want information you want a vibrant opinion that perhaps is a little bit different you never get it and so it's the gas\nRather than the host the host or ... who they are and you like them or you don't but I guess I mean it's just impossible ... it really is the result\nThe always you can see in the demographics it's there on the page every night on the overnight ratings the younger people are going away that's the first sign and then the cracks a once Trump gets off the stage 'cause he drives everything now hundred percent in the in the media once he gets off the stage it'll collapse\nSome Elizabeth a few minutes on your on your book thank you let's let's talk about um you know I Know why you wrote this book to two parallel and show the parallels of evil and how that can happen um but I'm I'm I'm fascinated by the stories that that you tell in this\n[noise] let me tell you to know so your listeners will understand what we're doing here and there was a concentration camp name ravens broke it was for women dressed women and it was north of Berlin\nAnd nobody ever heard of it of course the concentration camps were kept away from the German people they weren't spotlight it there was no there\nWere a news report Taj and the third Reich you did what they said or they put a bullet in your head or you went to the concentration camp [noise] so anyway I there's concentration care was a young woman named ... half H. U. T. H. and she had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ss gorge\nDid and she terrorized women\nAre and participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress and went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in Germany okay\nAnd then all of a sudden she's in a black uniform I'm killing and maiming and torturing other people are free off after the war ends of

check\nUh September eighth it's twenty Seventeen was the last night I went to church um\nEarly in the day and it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we became upon an idea that we're in a separate oh separating from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably separating\nUm and I looked at it on that day as a as a new beginning go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you were going to sue I didn't know what I was going to do and Clinton I I Will tell you that I Would ever\nWas written about me was false patently false ... who is a lie it never happened and had no one has ever ever come\nForward there was all in on them as a source and long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on and go find another job this could just go on forever and like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mine for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do\nWe cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we didn't celebrate\nThe owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations his new start pending nice\nDrank on the way

there indications or was it just a bad feelings that feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and was told to call your son right away without explaining why I had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with fat no it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know he he passed it was an accidental overdose\n[noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I ... at that moment I had no fight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close we spent the better part than the next year\nJust talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that\nIt's an epidemic excuse me and uh and\nUh people parents need to know

and why it matters last night uh and I and I asked the group\nIt\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they denied God three times in their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm and you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ... people don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but\nThere we are repeating Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive is him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nOn the table at the moment is or a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you ride but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative ... and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our ... that\nHad decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive ism isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is a this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts him said when the government removes the God the government will become the God\nAnd that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from a leftist when you trigger them on their on their ...\nIs the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and became seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan and say this okay say\nI'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes year where in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan has your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor you're you're attacking their idol this is not near political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement vicious religious fervor you're dealing with the elusive sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation dialing the understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] they couldn't short were they so they\nTranslate that into human language uh like I I think we see that with global warming with a with their reaction to abortion within his Robie weighed thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things [laughter] it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... is\nThis is pale as his\nYeah they if they don't necessarily know or they don't know it but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children [laughter] he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permit skewer sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the groves in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that what's the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange the truth for a lie so there's one big macro truth in in the

from fat\nSo you have no effect on insulin when you eat fat so if you just pure butter your blood sugar is not going to go up in ... not going to go up if you eat bread pasta rice corn products and sweets blood sugar's going to go up\nIn in so it's going to go up and then when you've had enough to eat the fat cells tests and non messages\nTo the brain stop what happens is when you become resistant is you become resistant to this hormone leptin\nYou become resistant to insulin okay and in some leads the resistance leptin so you don't think you're full she never fill up your always hungry\nOkay that's what leads to this feeling of low blood sugar when your type two diabetic and you're not really having low blood sugar it's because you're leptin resistant as well\nIn a way to change that is to make these lifestyle changes\nNeed lifestyle change mean eat less carbohydrates\nBlood sugar stays more stable insulin goes down your body starts to burn fat for energy pretty simple unfortunately when people are carbohydrates addicted\nWhen they make these changes if they cut their cars in my case I take about sixty grams a day in\nAnd I don't have any energy problems none at all I'm a highly after the active individual because I work with people all week long I Do on average between Seventy and eighty training sessions week yes a week\nRight and\nBesides that do my own work out on that kind of carbohydrate intake\nAnd have no energy prompt you may not be as lucky because again if you're carbohydrate addicted and you start to cut your cars on you may experience do you got the shakes okay even though your blood sugars normal\nBecause your energy is locked up because insulin levels fasting are too high to let you release fat for energy is locked away okay so it may take a period of time to break that addiction to get your body use to burning fat right but you can\nOkay what's help once you get past that point then you're on your way that's why people will tell you when they go on a low carb diet after a period of time to Hungary anymore because you know what lessons starting to work better again okay is getting to the brain and saying okay you've had enough to eat I don't need any more I'm not hungry\nBut you have to get to that point then you're burning body felt like crazy now here's one of the problems that people have when it comes to making dietary changes\nAnd why so many Americans are overweight\nIs because they don't stick on the program\nAfter a period of time to go right back to the same bad habits in over a period of time to gain the weight back you can't do that to yourself when you make a lifestyle change you have to make a lifestyle change you have to eat this way forever not doesn't mean you can't have a meal\nAnd enjoy yourself we call that a cheat meal just means you can't have it every day and in my case my program what I followed is they take one meal a week sometimes to most cases one where\nI eat whatever I Want to eat usually that's a Saturday Night gay and it's not in excess is just a little bit of whatever I Want\nAnd when you take that little break it gives you not only psychologically a break get your body break also makes you feel like a I'm not having to do the rest of my life where I can have anything I like to eat ever again that's not true it's just being controlled\nBut you have to decide you want to make those changes\nAs you do make those changes\nYou can see the benefits of eating and living like this I'm telling you I Am not an anomaly my blood work is not an anomaly is the result of years of dating like just in living like this year's can be exactly the same way if you make the decision you're going to do something about your health\nYou're going to do something about your fitness and you do something you make a strategic plan and stick to it and when you recruit people like myself\nTo allow you to make these changes you can follow through I knew I work with people starting according to five in the morning I can tell you I get my exercise is done in the morning early because I don't want to hire a trainer to train me\nI Need to get out of the weight I'm not going to do it at three o'clock in the afternoon and you can make these changes to\nHere's one thing you do to make the call or text me before four o'clock a free consultation and a funeral in my program the first training sessions at no cost phone number I'm off of ... and a one on one\nAnybody calls this accident Texan number leave your name where you're taxing from we'll get a whole you on

answer\n\nAnd nothing seems to work and I keep going back and saying that doesn't work\n\nAnd I keep getting the same answer and I keep looking at history\nDo not surrender\nDo not sit down do not
