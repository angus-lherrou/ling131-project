at the beginning of the hour was\nIs this we are is this what you want where are we headed\nA website allegedly run by University of Washington students allows individuals to publicly accuse people of sexual assault without any evidence\nThe website titled make them scared you'd W was first registered in November of last year but launched in late September of this year by University of Washington students the daily you W campus newspaper reports\nThat the list of accused rapist and sexual assault perpetrators has grown substantially on the site in last week's\nBecause of the Brett Kavanaugh scandal meanwhile one student named on the make them scared you W told the college fix that none of these accusations are true\nAccording to the F a cue page on the website make them scared you W is a communal rape list intended to be an online hubs for anyone who wants to expose the names of their attackers and harassed suffers\nAnd to fill that gap left by inadequate treatment of these cases by formal institutions\nOne of our sights moderators will review your submission verify your contact information and after receiving your confirmation publish the information you provided us a minus your personal identifying information\n[laughter] of course uh we do not have the ability to determine whether the cues party is guilty or innocent of the accused act so please take all the names listed with a grain of salt oh I'm sure that's what's gonna happen\nThe college fix managed to contact one student on the list a young man who was identified as attending University of Washington student denied having sexually assaulted his accuser quote I was investigated by my school's office and found that there was insufficient evidence of what she was accusing me up\nNow why would why would that matter we have to believe the witness\nYes I mean they did an investigation and they couldn't find enough evidence but is that really what we care about what about the poor accuser\nHe said uh the allegation stems from a night which he and his accuser both were pretty drunk\nAfter which he performed a ... on her and uh that attempted to initiate a intercourse ... we seem pretty comfortable with the various Kyrie all of them is accuser said no at which point he backed off\nThis girl gave the investigator all at my school literally everything all of our Facebook messages are Snapchat messages she saved all of them text messages and even my ready to count\nAnd I was deemed to be so not a threat to her that the investigator didn't even care if I was in the same class with her\nThat's the path I'm choosing and we do that at the top of next hour don't miss\nThe\nMost Americans in our home is the biggest investment that we will make and when it comes time to sell your home you want the

all kinds of media sources or a you know people ranting and raving on the radio and\nTelevision and newspapers and magazines and all that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors are always working\nUh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of or I hadn't thought when there are\nPeople who are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like\nA Google Search engine they turn off the biased detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm\nNot that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything ah what what tends to happen is if people trust sweats higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has\nVery carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate or one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of that now we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again if I favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes where there's no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities\nTo track you that is scary it is you\nUm you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about\nHow Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then ah ... how they have ... you know\nThe ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the last\nAlmost no one was aware that they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent\nOf people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preference says so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is\nJust this is an ability to shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world uh\nYou know and and it was they had the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results have felt like a news story they just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the spot\nAt that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that this is the\nThis is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda\n[noise] [noise] oh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called\nA ... ways big tech can shift\nMillions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation effects are seen as the eye me\nThat's just one of ten ways uh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift boats\nAnd that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they were ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using a the Google bang\nAnd Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called a monitoring system and so it was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise] uh and we found\nA systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way\nAs you mentioned a in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty blase that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nThat we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners in academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh you know I Wish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I Would say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us or that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\n\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in\nThe yeah well ... you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and their products are so good so but you don't realize that these aren't real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform [laughter]\nUh I Do have a little bit more good news about what does that film that you mentioned the creepy lie as\nA when ... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter Schweitzer on your your show recently though is uh uh he's the one who would who really got that film running a\nIt sure wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tunes for for rental or sale and it's it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just goes to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\n[noise] well when I when my research\nA first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter] I have these amazing screen shots that\nThey're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have to screen shot showing getting these time out saying no no you can't get their sorry\n... okay let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last seven ten or ten of these that you're following or\nCan altogether okay out an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick begin\nVery good when okay here we go this is called bath as the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestion that you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source\nBut beyond that we've learned through our experiments that Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty votes among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWith all my one having any idea that they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay\nWe're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have\nTime he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to\nDo about it you need to know about it you can see it in the creamy line\nIt's a new documentary the creepy line dot com the freebie line

a you know uh there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than\nTwo point five billion people soon to be over four billion a whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected a dramatically ah\nEvery single day by a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that that's already\nGoing full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were trying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way\nWe then have the search suggestion of fact now target\nMessaging affect what is the targeting charts the\nShura targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing affect a is really scary ah this\nThis means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November\nTwo thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders uh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton or exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that wasn't even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went just a supporter of Hillary Clinton back\nIt's given her that day and additional\nFour hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I I don't I\nI don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident or you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat I'm not\nI'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data\nThat that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts boats and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't that what targeted advertising\nIs all about but you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive so\nCan I mean this is so dangerous\nUm and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has invasion

years I mean since since we you know we're working together just the two of us in the nineties and I said someday it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe your eyes\nWhile we're there I've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour why did that affect you so much um\nCouple of things uh one I think like we all ... there's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that\nThere's some evidence that they do um you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they made lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true and a lot of case\nUm you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter would do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this is this you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks\nThey've known in all this is like a lot of there's a leader in in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real deal with\nSome real credibility again comes it comes from the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to as he describes Hillary and voter right right um\nBut beyond that uh ... seems incredibly hopeless to me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time\nHow do we move how do we how do we convince people how to persuade people to look at the world and they're slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right ah and we talk about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it's but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to own my wine myself from Google I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm In I'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance apparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time\nI mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do\nIs it's the best what right like this is the problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know a search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know it's you get into deep stuffing you but I I don't even know how to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using that and I went to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on chrome\nSo now I got straight ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life is turned upside down and I can't I Can't come up with enough personal\nCost\nTo what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say\nThree hundred million word yet documentary million\n... is like a ... of of\nData on you and that ... million pages pages of data and again like but I I don't know what it's a personal cost to me in that data well there's\nSeveral things there are some things that could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent go the way that Google wants them to go that then that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before\nYou are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that it is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to\nThe problem is not today this is not today it's just technology\nIs now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth in ways that we will not be able\nTo understand I mean as the book I write about this in addicted outrage and you know use it you said when you read the uh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak\nOh yeah but I mean and fail in their right right\nIt's it's it I mean it ... you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years and he's a he's a Clinton supporter or is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nI mean I think if anything it back that up and that's that's was terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think\nAs a catastrophe pissed right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google risk a row search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton\nIs not some wild crazy theory it's something that's already happened in his over where are they now what are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes\nBeing built by Google and Facebook\nAnd a\nMan if if things heat up [noise]\nDon't be a part of the problem being part of the solution\nDe informed real news in real time news talk five fifty KFYI um\nHuh [noise]\nNews I'm Carmen Roberts no second swearing in front of justice Brett Kavanaugh as President Trump apologizes for what the justice went through to make it to the Supreme Court cannot says it didn't change him\nI Will continue to heat the message of Matthew twenty five I Will continue to volunteer to serve the least fortunate\nAmong us his words are unlikely to change the minds of Democrats DNC chairman Tom Burris told his supporters that Republicans must quote pay a price for putting Brett Kavanaugh on the high court\nTux has type ...
