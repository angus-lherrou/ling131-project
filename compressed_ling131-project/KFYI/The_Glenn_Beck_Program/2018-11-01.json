environmentalists who you know\nThey they they care about you know they care about the animals there and they care about the planet they care about everything they ah believe we should the killer pets now\nUh because we have this compulsion to speak to seek out an ... animal companionship it is one of our primary factors are ... are affecting our climate\nParticularly in the United states where there are one hundred and sixty three million companion animals roughly one pet for every two Americans the highest number of any country in the world [noise] and\nThose one hundred and sixty three million pets have detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume to the waste they produce\nSo the best thing we can do is killer pat euthanize every every one of our pets\nI don't know about you but I care about the planet I'm willing to do all that I'm really into human I was willing to\nGet rid of all the yeah all of the cats get rid of all just the cats though yeah mhm yeah I think so we seem to be anti cat that's why I'm asking well then you have also that the cats are responsible for\nKilling over a billion birds a year\nYeah yeah so yeah there are bad for the environment to six billion small animals yeah but a billion birds specifically and\nFor those see that ... there was a news story out they've talked about the predator\nThat is in your house ... and it is a cat and they are killing birds and the ... billions of animals mhm billions of animals and uh we have to we have to euthanize the cats and I'm willing to go there\nI Am too because first of all uh I got a theory about cat owners in a you know I I Do too if you have one yeah you're worth monitoring day we should mount an hour I think you\nCan have one but your family should notice yes yes yeah I don't want to monitor or do you start ... yes to you you should have to register at the school ... you should have to read you know you should have to register with all maybe local law enforcement and we should just know where you are\nYou at all the time that all time at all times if you have three yeah are you guys way institutional I ...\nI was ... she was the I think I think more than three is when you need to be destroyed at some of them I don't why spend the money on ... yes ... oh you're crazy ... something's gonna happen ... everybody's\nGoing to go you're going to ... and the cats are going to do anyway yeah so and we might as well just so you'd avoid all that yeah but I I think the rice cat people or disturbing they really are but can you do all this with executive order you need to get legislation on you know we'd only vying for the executive order yeah yeah\nSo Trump can just do this ... ... it was like he can with the executive order on the morning [laughter] constitution ... executive order\nI mean they can I ask you ... where do you stand on that executive order pat [noise] um we heard this from yesterday I was a lively and places yesterday we talked about this\nYesterday after we spoke and um that there is a pretty good case made by originalists that say no no no it ... it birthright anchor anchor babies that's what the what is what they meant and that's right\nIt's yeah it's uh it's interesting that there's two sides of it among people ... among conservatives which is why these are the types of issues I find most interesting is the case for maybe a little piece of it here and we all take this out at World War two as well if you want to\nBe able to bring you can view it you'll dismantle it quickly ... skin but it's interesting that it's coming from a conservative originalists you felt that you just metal this quickly oh yeah okay [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh yeah you don't feel like you did you know even my the gates you know you do you'll\nJames Madison said it is an established maxim that there is a that birth is it criterion of allegiance birth however derives its force or sometimes from place and sometimes from parentage but in general place is the most certain criteria and it is what applies in the United states\nIt will therefore be unnecessary to investigate any other\nIs a goes on to a then quote this is the um this is Edward Bates President Lincoln hurting general way way way can we separate these two [noise]\nBecause the first one is James Madison hard to take it apart you know since James Madison right now however James Madison I think in this particular case James Madison is is looking at something different piece\nAll citizens no that doesn't make sense to anybody did I did definitely all she could we could ideally right not a good idea\nConstitution at this this this this is the best phrase and I just I Can't understand how people don't understand that the constitution was not meant to be a suicide pact that's positive\nOr a ... but that's also a very dangerous free it's like it's I I I feel like that the same argument people use with the second amendment\nWell they would they look I mean that the time they only had\nThese little weapons into that what I don't know well sure they wanted freedom of guns I mean these guys are too big into the brutal and this is not meant to be a suicide power\nWhen I'm Talking about suicide pack I mean on the principles on the principles it's not meant to be a suicide pacts if we follow these principles you won't have a constitution you won't have America anymore you just won't\nBecome ... nobody doing it for a hundred years and we still have America are not doing it differently now there was not the have a baby tourism back in Nineteen hundred [laughter]\nNo I mean it certainly being exploited at some level that right I mean but that does not mean huge than them like let's just say we flew out of your human is an argument to amend the constitution right yeah let's just say if it were their intent was at the beginning let's just say it was that we wanted it alien\nStudents come in and have been dropped babies over here and then they're going to be anchor babies and they're going to get citizenship would just say that with their intent I don't think it was but let's just say it was\nIf that was true and and back then people weren't exploding and now people are you in our ... should not the U.S said we now think problem\nIf you want to change guns don't make some slippery argue just amended Eighteenth amendment twenty First Amendment and we said you know what we're going to ban all alcohol we did it bad idea twenty First Amendment forget the Eighteenth amendment we need a drink [laughter]\nRight yeah and that's the way you're supposed to do it yeah and they don't want to do it that way because it's hard it's hard and they know that it's impossible to make the argument because when you do something that big you actually have to think about it\nAnd that's why the president's not suggesting we have a constitutional amendment to suggesting in order right\nAnd that's when it will be overturned

was really allowed to just you know create a lot of victims\nSo a lot of the victims of Bolger are still very angry with the federal government and the department of Yahoo ruin the victims be\nUh you know dozens of family\nIt's a who were the victims of white these crimes I mean Whitey would\nOh I see what you're saying but he did he put anybody behind bars did he have did he ran out anybody that\nIn the end that a government get anything\nAh that's open to debate the Boston Globe would\nTell you that yes yes he was a wonderful informing him that they broke the story but there's evidence to suggest that it was a it was a greater cover for just protecting Whitey because with the uh a\nFederal authorities trying to crack down on the mob or the Italian Mafia\nOr any hit on the mafia would have to run through a Bulger's winter hill gang and some people\nFeel and claim and there was strong evidence to suggest that the informing part was just the cover and really\nThey were allowing Whitey the live so that the then head of the\nStrike force in New England to bring down the Italian Mafia a guy named Jeremiah Tio Sullivan was looking for a little quid pro quo like hey Whitey we'll let you do your thing\nAs long as you make sure the ... the mob doesn't you know kill me ah because there were incidence of lawyers and prosecutors are getting killed in retaliation for bringing down the mob so\nYou know a lot of those allegations have not been proven but his real\nConnection to the information that he gave as being actually great invalid and information is is to me one of the\nMyth of this case uh\nYou know we'd we'd need much longer\nTime period to really discuss it but the documentary kinda delves into the how much free reign the guy was given and again if you're an informant for the government it doesn't mean you can go and commit crimes that means you're working hand in hand with the government in exchange for some benefit like a ... like not being prosecuted or a\nLesser sense it doesn't mean oh\nPlease go out and Rob kills steel and maim that people are and there were there have been several\nCivil suits brought against ah the department\nOf justice that have not gone and the families a direction and so there's a lot of that there's still a lot of bitter feelings amongst the people who were who were victims of Bulger's crimes some of them were you know criminals themselves but that doesn't\nThat doesn't mean it's still a man or the end doesn't justify the means to arrive for this guy\nFor a quarter century uh was allowed to just kill with impunity I mean he was tipped off in advance a about wiretaps he was tipped off in advance about potential rates are so it's really a complicated and in fact some people believe that\nThe sixteen years he was on the lam living in an apartment in Santa Monica with his girlfriend Catherine Greek uh there there are many including myself who believe that the government really wasn't\nLooking very hard for him until a new regime came in and then after sixteen years they decided to bring him to justice and and there was a trial in the summer of twenty thirties\nSo let's talk a little bit about the first myth you talked about that he was known as a you know a good guy in the neighborhood isn't that yeah I mean this is my impression and maybe I'm wrong in this isn't that kind of the thing with you know Al Capone tried to do\nThat and you know people like to think that I don't know these guys are just you know they're whack in just the bad guys there actually good family man you know and there was a day when you would kill a man and then you'd send his wife flowers\nYeah is that any of that true\nI ... that seems to be the case that ah you know he also did\nSome very good things as well you know for at times but for for some people um and also for example there was a big bussing crisis in South Boston you know a there was an attempt to desegregate and there was a bussing order issued\nAnd Whitey actually was very vociferous ... you know in campaigning against it and that kind of rallied south Boston residents are ... to him um\nHe was a good guy but because I mean that helps create cover for him and a hill\nYeah exactly and his brother was a famous politician so there was all you can\nUse in there as well you know with a will you know bill Bolger president of the University of Massachusetts in a prominent politician I'm so there was a lot of messy gray areas there with the ...\nHow did he was he involved was he just the guy saying yay whack him or was he involved in the killings\nOh he he took pleasure [laughter] and and being involved in the killings and you know his his signature because back then there was no DNA evidence his signature was removing teeth of his victims um you know uh\nSo that they couldn't be identified but no no he was a he was a willing and ruthless participant in some very grisly murders\nAnd how was that there was a there was a a neighborhood\nHouse that they had called the haunting where a number of these victims were buried in the in the dirt basement of of the actual house that they used as a meeting place so there's ... there's just a lot\n\nA lot of grizzly detail with with this case but uh I mean the real for me the fascinating thing is after sixteen years\nOn the land they finally caught him in Santa Monica living quiet you know living a a quiet a life a retirees life you know he had a ... almost nine hundred thousand dollars in cash and stuck in the walls and the coterie of a machine guns and weapons\nBut living a just a quiet life and when he's finally\nCaught and brought back to Boston\nFor trial you know he offered to plead guilty in exchange for this is another\nI've been looking at some of the notices and these are some of the things that have been left out you know he offered to plead guilty if they would take it easy on his girlfriend has you know who is living girlfriend Catherine ... who joined him for the sixteen years of being on the run\nOn and off you know he ... he was willing to plead guilty if they would take it easy on her and give her some very light treatment a and the government refused and you have to ask yourself why why did we go through a multimillion dollar\nTrial a four Whitey Bolger when the\n... you know the the the conclusion was foregone at the smarter than trial nobody thought he would be found not guilty I mean the evidence was just overwhelming um and it probably would have ...\nSave the state uh quite a bit of money to not try him but but ah they didn't take it easy on um um how they can grow and how they catch him\nA there was you know they decided to focus on the girlfriend and they play some advertisements a and a woman ... ... you know noticed ah not Whitey but the girlfriend and called it in and got a nice reward for that\nSo we have suddenly prosecuted the woman who turned him in\nA well no no no no not the woman who turned\nOh another okay another woman did not the girlfriend another woman current event okay okay yeah now he was killed yesterday I never I I I mean I besides Dr seuss I didn't know who would come up with a lock in a sock\nA buddy apparently was was killed by a guy they think is they actually says there's a guy in prison who is a mob hit man\nWho they think killed him they know he was a mob hitman um who would was everybody against this guy was he marked for death as soon as they could kill him\nA well look I don't I don't have the details of yesterday and it's you know it's hard to say but you know he is responsible for helping or you know\nBring down the Italian Mafia so you would imagine that uh there would be people who would be out for his his death or and you have to question\nYou know the the security and uh you know it's still unclear to me I'm Still trying to get some information as to why he was being moved and why the multiple moves and why the lack of secure\nNews talk five fifty KFYI\nCome\nOn the News I'm Jill NATO and President Trump says the U.S may send as many as Fifteen thousand troops to the U.S Mexico border\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis

appreciate it to be here\nGood so so tell me what the white people should vote for you in in Mississippi\nWell I'm the only lifetime Republican in this race the only conservative in this race my record demonstrates that I've been fighting these fights my entire life you might remember back at twenty fourteen we rarely get set up the cockpit and he was a forty one year income but it'll be defeated in the first night\nWith forty nine point seven percent of the vote a heat then recruits forty thousand Democrats to come to a GOP primary and they beat us about one percent going down the stretch where it back and that said five which is a seat we feel like we rightfully one twenty four teams the establishment stole this seat and\nNow we walked this seat back on the conservative and I'm ready to fight Washington DC so\nWhat does it mean to be a conservative now Chris\nWell from my perspective that made the same thing that always Seth I'm a cow Jeffersonian a Reagan Goldwater conservative and what that basis is where we demand limited government we demand individual responsibility we demand liberty we have to trend toward liberty and everything that we do\nAt some point along the way this country we advocated average ... government we gave it over to the federal government is counter week claim that authority so in everything that we do or empowering individual not

proof that he committed any act\nIf that's the case I drove through process that are tree is presumed innocent the burden was on her not ill he didn't have to prove his innocence to it she had to prove his guilt she couldn't do that so I thought what the Democrats put his family through was an absolute nightmare you should have been confirmed but show\nWhat did you what do you think we should do uh with the the caravan if it makes it to our border\nOr they can't be allowed to enter period that's just bottom line rogue nation of laws that they cannot defend its borders cannot ... nation these individuals could not be allowed in this country period\nSo what do you do\n[noise] the combination of terrible things if you have to use the military just military but also I Would like to see if we couldn't get Mexico and Bob I'm tired of Mexico you know the corrupt state that it is failing to take action and allowing\nThese people to go across your ... your to our border I mean after all Mexico dependable enough to prop up the economy north trade off through direct subsidies they should take some responsibility of stopping these people but if they talk about the individual if we have to use the ... the American military we've certainly will\nBirthright citizenship should that be a is that what the constitution says uh should this be a Supreme Court decision should there be an amendment and the second question can the president do that by executive order\nHere's the thing is the birthright citizenship it's absolutely not intended for children up in ... it's not intended for
