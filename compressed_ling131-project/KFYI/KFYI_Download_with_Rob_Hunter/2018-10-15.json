Hi I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five\nSix courses or something like that\nUm and it would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph gumption bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face you\nKnow so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it to me is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up to a place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the plates throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and ... that's the kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is
