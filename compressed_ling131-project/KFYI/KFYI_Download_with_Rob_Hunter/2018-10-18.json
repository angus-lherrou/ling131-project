of that or or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission

four hundred and some change there's you know they're listing a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with

of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection
