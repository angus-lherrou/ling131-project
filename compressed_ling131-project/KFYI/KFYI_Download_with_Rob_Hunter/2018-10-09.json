GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did kill off eight fold just like you thought so why are

guests bart is entirely right um we are using a a ton of his weapons which may kill decisions of course we've done that\nSince landmines wheat crop we dropped dumb bombs or I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill 'em so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that\nThat we push a button and we don't know
