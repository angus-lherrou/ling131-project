Romans were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true\nIt it was before nine gene Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try and find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within ...\nAnd minutes another family came from around out simply to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nSaid Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had to walk with what's your name [noise]\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks and the boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bumped them but this is the part I Want you know it had kinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looks humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped\nAt least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was

said that he was inside the Boulder gift and made it for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that is the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there are stories of Iceland\nThat they will move road when they're building it before they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder because they have a bully in their
