gradually backwards at the beginning [laughter] um but no that that's that I couldn't tell from that from that description of may have written that\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes out the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually one step beyond I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year I'm Out of limits came afterwards but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma and we're taking away I appreciated\nYour neck you know starting man he was he he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber\nComing home from Italy crashes in the desert the cat that airplane didn't go on a mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob comings I'm Sorry and Bob coming it's just having me walking by seeing this newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we live the experience even though he didn't fly that nation you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd haven't psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and ... when the show in the closer the ending of it\nThe nurse is closing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes and so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time to be twenty five ... crashed you know struggling with those shows that ... did\nHe had a time machine you know one of them this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to capture events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed it one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so\nAnd he ended up in Nazi Germany they're already thought he could alter that event of\nCourse but a man I don't know we it it'd be hard to say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store and that call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine\nWhen he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was the man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything\nHe went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back out and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bags of a sudden became full of gifts that did it uh you know and pecans man he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy that ran a department store they found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John ... type place you know when it comes and goes where did you get all these gifts if you got a receipt for all these is Bob Bob and he goes no I just\nI found the bag and shrimp and I'm just giving them out taking the PlayStation and the department store owner came in and say yeah there it is there is the merchandise oh well you're the by by by you know\nAnd the guy's name was Mr gun department store right and and empty to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty can it right there\nSo they had to go and of course the store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raced in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr gundy\nHuh you know say merry Christmas and both\nOf them got pre or post it on the wine and they walked outside and they think Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer\nOh and it was ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in the twilight zone feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again
