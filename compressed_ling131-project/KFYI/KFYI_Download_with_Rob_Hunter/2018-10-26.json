heat they become much more common in the future and\nCan have devastating consequences\nRight now what are computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye BCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those the stuffed with\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on my guess is that the politicians assume that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem attract cater to decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the facts\nIt there will probably be be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do when it's what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be young and in fact already are places that are are having to be abandoned both on the east coast right on the Alaska duty rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their cities become habitable\nAnd that's really one of the things that the report highlights were you guess ... of such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from Lola choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises fair\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut it has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we showed it has for years ago\nSo global climate change and increasing more could definitely bring more wars\nYes yeah there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen\nMillion for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the Mac rest of the century and in fact it is so bad\nUm the forty eight caught and now us they\nFlorida now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking that title flooding the researchers say if that global warming and sea level rise does continue\nThat in more than one million properties in Florida well have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat the level why which is already one of the big secret a cap in Miami by the political institution\nThere is it they get flooding constantly on full mind constantly flooding on high tides they get constantly flooding all over the time and everybody who live there now and that\nPolitical governments and mirrors saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami not and\nThey've got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida\nOver the Next Fifty years and know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster if Florida had water flooding\nLet's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that didn't mean that most of the southern tip of Florida will be uninhabitable and that leads back\nTo what drew ...
