{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "Now George thinks that it's not going to happen and I don't know I kinda think it will but I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to ask questions and I want to get a few linked then because I don't I turned twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do thing I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to the point we're gonna have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest\nInflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare they're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on and we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nAnd on you know permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just send it you know send period to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but\nIf if they just sent everybody at twenty ... every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made\nWall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main still\nThe reason why I wanted to volunteer as opposed to check areas because I wanted them to be forced to spend that red line them you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they you're right that that's much better way to the point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron in very good them\nWell hello there George and Harry him that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh he taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nI I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite end the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center banks thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to exploit parade money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent in towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union than you know bank of America or wells\nOr or ... or a city or stuff like\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with her dad Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOkay do you think you\nGet tired of one of my question is why\nAre they All right All right I'm On the line\nRob yup it's all about timing\nWhat am I ... I call it [noise] um [noise] what's your answer my questions\nAbout smaller I'm Out of my life [noise] um I don't have to worry about so much and I'm a larger account holder\nYeah I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take off on a larger\nAccounts and more fluid people first let me know every day person is going to be more protective whatever scenario\nInsurance to agree that they can ensure the opposite and they can ensure that ... the author ensure they insure everything if you have a major club but smaller account spread out a few cows and you have money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get\nYeah sure where you live what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russia's big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit for the positives for Iceland went down and basically all the foreign depositors at foreign laws and protecting their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just in general the positive they lend against those deposits in real estate business loans go bad they're going again you're the positive but if you have a brokerage account\nWhen your stocks bonds or cash at it [noise]\nThey they can't those reserves\nOn lots of good playing Carrie thank you were out of time here ...
