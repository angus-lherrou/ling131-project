possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work in my work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on dancing\nWith water which in yes okay I've seen it work see at work and then seeing the drillers calm\nAnd drill right to that same to adapt and there it is on the ... and ... you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's\nNot that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nAnd then can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er and I've seen it with three different methods brass rods willow sticks and\n... over a map mhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most

cannot ignore this going all the way back\nHe your your guest mentioned William James\nOkay all that whole period when all of this a lot of his early early research started\nInto shall we say ... ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I mean I've never seen a U.S I've never seen what I could call us ... and the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw

from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it yeah\nEven raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic Institute\nShouldn't even talk about these things I've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual and different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field ...\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglement and the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one\nYou affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness\nNow Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light with the fact that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles\nSo there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counterintuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically\nThis it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are and that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which\nIf we're all connected and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that it has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can
