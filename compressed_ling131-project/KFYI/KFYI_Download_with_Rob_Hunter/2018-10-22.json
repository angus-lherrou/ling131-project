{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "And one of those harrowing stories was where you know there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um attacked increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking don't use drugs they oh there's food all just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young intern by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and thinking he was going to wiggle his toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and\nOh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely\nA sale they think across the Philippines the um and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rat\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case there\nWere four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day\nOkay that's right so that there were so any water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the manager and the tea hydration itself with perversely causing then to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason that\nSome of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into the into his now and thinking that that would straighten themselves out well of course that didn't and then other when you know take\nMall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk and out of it but then eventually they would just begin coping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBought that full bird\nBlood cell ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around either that or it without a site all the sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it did sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a ... pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bird Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight and they\nSee this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's now reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action though he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this\nShould anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there\nHe actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's
