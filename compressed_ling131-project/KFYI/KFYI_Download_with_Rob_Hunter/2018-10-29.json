{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "The book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes I give talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality\nAnd then they come back to this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books\nSo yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future [noise]\nAnd and all of our defending future's all of those moments already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions Scott wants to look at it just after my book but you can also look at Brian Greene book he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so\nI'm done and none of it's all laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issue right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices um and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more possible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lifted itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension that dreaming stuff he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space last or is there um that's what he believed to happen in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as a as additional facial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody\nEverybody's sleeping so had the degree of freedom and he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and half the time I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world

murdered in a synagogue on Saturday mornings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nThey were there of course to worship there were there because they believe in God\nThey're asking for guidance praying for others there were there in the synagogue for all the right reasons that's what a man allegedly with their hatred of Jews walks through the door and started shooting killing eleven wounding many others he shot three police officers that were responding to reports of gunfire\nAnd of course as one can predict\nWe turn to blame right away times of tragedy before we start to process before you start to mourn\nYou have to find someone or something to blame\nPolitics was to blame according to conversations some Sunday shows yesterday top leader the Anti Defamation league saying yes it's because of current political rhetoric\nAnti Semitism has moved from the margins into the mainstream as political candidates and people in public life now literally repeat the rhetoric of a white supremacist\nNational director and CEO Jonathan Green blasts saying that on NBC's Meet the press that press the pause on this because I don't know that it's entered the mainstream maybe I'm missing the mark but I don't see politicians say negative things about Jewish people so wrapping this up blaming politics just doesn't seem to be accurate to me\nBut of course then the president's weighing into he's blaming something else saying the media is the biggest part of the problem oh just writing just a few minutes ago\nThere's great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate even fraudulent reporting on the news fake news media the true enemy of the people the president continued must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly\nThat will do
