{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "A net global forestry growth on the planet force are still shrinking but\nIn two thirds of the world's nations the United states Western Europe Russia China we have for us growth are stable force so there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited we at all for us and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA\nOr their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a if\nYou look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big uh port [noise] um in in the\nNorthwest Italy an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans\nWere higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what they what they think in California\nRoost in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension I perhaps where a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky and say no doubt this uh\nA lot of ... harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to himself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at a manufactured why\nYou're not seeing the real no weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago ... animated cartoon but\nThere's a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite maps but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricane they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zone and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather\n... ones don't hear about it and the new Luskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in and tell ... go ahead [laughter]\nWell it's going to that man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat the way they're adults is being gay or engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently at gentleman on his show talking about ... put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son where people are so much heck shoes word hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather they want or against that they want to intensify the hurricane through the age of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham ... they want they were doing a stripping the wealth of industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China that's over there with their sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either is Russia but the United states of America was going to play the oh I Know now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comments
