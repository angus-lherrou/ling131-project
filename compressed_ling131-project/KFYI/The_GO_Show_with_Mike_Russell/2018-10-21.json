Bennett is because so many of those Canadian\nPeople bought a second home in Florida and it's so unfortunate but with the natural disasters in Florida they are opting now for Arizona ... overprice so they're looking at Arizona because we're a tremendous value we\nJust met with Marty and she said I'm her clients are starting to look that way for a while they were going Florida like you said for that part of Canada\nBut she said now it just makes more sense to come to Arizona and she said what we see when we're looking at the statistics of what's going on in Arizona she said it seems like your state is moving forward and the right direction and that jobs are being created and things and she said that's important test Canadians when looking to see what's going on locally\nAnd so we're doing some international cross marketing with with several teams right now in the ... candidate area\nAnd and they do have fires that are going to be purchasing um this fall and this winter and and into twenty Nineteen while I Will\nTell you that are on October ... issue of the wall Street Journal they named the tin top cities in the United states in the U.S to retire\nArizona was represented by five of those cities I saw that yes we had ...

I Would agree but in Arizona and what we're seeing some of these markets like California that are slowing down their stagnant well these families are saying we want to move and they're picking Arizona and you're getting people now that unfortunately we've had that devastation and Florida and places coming here\nAnd I think what we're going to see it's because of the affordability and the sunshine I think the Arizona is going to be okay I think some parts of the country yes you're going to see their markets drastically change but Arizona as we move forward it looks like we're we're a great place to be\nAnd it's awesome that people are looking at our state and saying they want to come here\nI I think it is to in because we are sunshine state and we are devoid of of natural disasters this is a

little bit late on the four oh five\nFreeway and I had to you know take a detour because of this or that it's just you know nothing happened you know it's not a positive end to the story because a longer story so there's two types of outdoor stories well hey how's your ... go\nHold up your cell phone picture you don't even say a word it shorter than the shorter stories nightmare story here boom so you say and there's some that are longer than ever but I'll tell you those are the best ones not liking sale the longer the story the better\nI'm telling you get excited about long stories\nWhen it comes to the outdoor world it could be like you said it could be your first time tell me about your first time ... tell me about your first time in a kayak to me about your first Fisher call tell me the story\nDon't just tell me it was a bass telling me the story it's so important in such a rich part of what we do\nGot a great show coming up um we've got a great way for you to help our men and women and blue we love our first responders or we love our we love our police officers we have in it to help pay great great cause it's been here in the valley and doing so much good\nSilent witness and yeah you get to shoot some place I bought that um and there's a couple of headlines I Want to get you caught upon including a game and fish head commissioner of a game and fish to bar none of area that is in a lot of heat\nAnd actually had to step down on tell you that story we talk about that as well in the best of outdoor Halloween the best outdoor Halloween\nCostumes and check this out Halloween scary movies that are outdoors themed all that's all coming up right here on the go show things were hanging out with us don't go away [laughter]\nI've got a frog in my field it's a pleasure Murray ruined and I apologize in advance for you to listen voice talent you ride a spelling really\nProtect us to take care of us our first responders are men and women in uniform\nAre our finest around the valley and in amazing organization amazing program that you've heard about if you've spent any time here in Arizona you had to have heard of silent witness know silent witnesses a program that deals with it just it acts on donations that works on donations and fund raising\nAnd there's a cool fundraising I Want to tell you about but first I Want to introduce Jamie Ross out of silent witness thanks for being here man I really appreciate it and now I tell us tell us what silent when this all about talk about\nWhat how it started in what it does\nSo we're coming up on our fortieth year next year will be forty years in the valley and really what it is it's although I'm employed by the Phoenix police department\nI'm really never in uniform because I represent all belly agencies and what we do is we asked the public information officers or anyone who talks to the communities to say if you have information on a crime Memphis felony crime will pay but if you have information either log on to our website or\nCall our phone number give us that information you're really completely anonymous which a lot of people have trouble believing anymore nowadays but completely anonymous and I can I can walk them through how that works\nWhen you call you're going to get a code number you give the information and when you're done with the call you'll be asked to call back or contact us through the Web and about thirty days if that information led to an arrest you're eligible for cash and all you'll do as you'll take that code number into a bank\nYou'll hand over the code number though handy cash there's no signatures no photos none of that and we'll walk you through how to do it but it really it's an anonymous way for the community to get information to law enforcement to make their communities safer and interestingly enough\nNot even all the rewards and actually probably about half of the ... even get picked up really and those rewards are not paid by governments and so I'm paid as by the Phoenix police department but every dollar that we give away\nIs ... is gained by fundraisers and so you have board members like clay who we're joined by today who facilitate these fundraisers they work with the public to get the donations rolling in and then we law enforcement process those with the detectives make the arrest\nAnd the community gets paid that's amazing that's a great program how long has a program going on so we're gonna we're going to host the national conference next year and at that time we're going to celebrate our forty if you're here in the valley forty years ... years but most people just assume and I understand why that is a police department program\nBut what it is it's a combination of police department media community and our board members who do the heavy lifting\nYeah okay and it's been forty years strong it's absolutely amazing how ... tell me how many uh get a guesstimate if you would per year how many tips or calls actually lead to arrest\nSo we can't get to meet that because when we have a high profile event like the serial shooter or I get it we get thousands of extra tip oh we did we got thousands and thousands but I'll tell you that we're averaging right now about three per week\nFelons people commit robbery homicide sexual assault or some serious crime three per week so I tell people if you envision every Monday Wednesday friday some\nOffender is taken off the street because of the communities information so cool working with law enforcement it really does work and it makes the community safer and if you envision a like a a Boeing seven thirty seven airplane we fill up that plane every year with people arrested on serious felonies charges because of what the community gives us\nJust giving the community a great place to help out and get a crime off the street so clay creature I really appreciate you guys you know putting this together for them and Jamie Ross out of the course everything you guys do it silent when this and in this all the officers in the valley thank you very much hay coming up let's get you caught up on some headlines there was some odd stuff\nGoing on

you can you just put those two together something bad is going to happen and one of the hunters accidentally shot a writer and that was a accidentally I have to give the kid the benefit of the doubt young guy and\nHere's what I have to say I always preach that you wear orange I Know it's not required when you're hunting in Arizona where orange please just do it\nThe deer and going to you're not going to get busted 'cause you have orange and even if you are you might have not even knowingly as your life saved by your orange I have a firm\nBeliever in my mind that I'm Alive today because I wear orange whether that is true or not you'll never know right but I have a\nFirm believer that because it motivates me to keep wearing orange\nI don't let my guard down\nSomething oranges on me I Would say that if you know the hunting seasons you're not a hunter you know the hunting seasons\nYou know where people hunt out educate yourself on educate yourself like you might be ... maybe hiking trail you might be not even ... you might be out wandering and exploring\nWhere orange I Would say just in the fall seasons if you're out if you're outside of the city limits I Would wear something orange I'm not saying that it's the cyclists fault for not wearing orange I says the fault of those two\nOrganizations butting up against each other but I Would suggest that you were hired this stuff\nAnyway if you're out hiking in exploring you'll where some people can see the next one or we can say about this rule and talking about too there's some kind of got me there was a commissioner
