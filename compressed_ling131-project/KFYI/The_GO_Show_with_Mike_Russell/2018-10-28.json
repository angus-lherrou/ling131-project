I mean a real medical first aid kit\nUh it just because things do happen and if they happen accidents happen if they happen you're ready for it\nAnd you can educate yourself and once again if you're a seasoned veteran not let your guard down to help eliminate some of those accidents or just curbed the potential\nFor some of those accidents but we really appreciate you being here and and I appreciate you allowing me to bring up things that aren't just hey I'm just going to tune in and just enjoy the ride on the go show I don't\nIt it there's parts of our outdoor world that you need to be reminded of and I appreciate you allow me to do that but I didn't tell you though to bring the mood of the room back I went to the Arizona game and fish business some your ears on a game and fish department business summit\nAnd they do this twice a year and it's put on by Scott Lebanon Doug Burt and it is absolutely fantastic\nIs exactly what it is it is the businesses in the outdoor world\nThat want to know the state of our state the\nEconomics the political impact of what's going on and want to learn about other businesses that are in our state that they can you know either use not use or how they're benefiting what we do on the outer world\nAnd ... and please reach out to a game and fish if if you want to be a part of this because all you have to do a sign up and it was a pretty packed room it was great\nI've been going for a couple of years now they do it twice a year it's fantastic and I'll tell you I I learned something every single time I go and at the end of the event by the way they feel I should be a really nice lunch at the end of the event\n... Ben ... for you to go out and shooting on them\nAmmo firearms everything ... have a good time and I think next some if they're going to have something special that's what's got lab and said so I Would I'm guessing it might be a long range kind of thing but that's just my guess\nBut usually they're they're thrown out some place and they take care of the ammunition and all that but this is a very unique thing to Arizona game and fish\nScott lab and and I you know I Would say Larry boils the commissioner the former commissioner former director of game and fish and now the president of wildlife to for tomorrow I think they champion this and made it so\nAnd really solve the benefit right out of the gates of getting local business leaders involved in what they're doing\nAnd getting their selves involved in local business leaders are doing it's fantastic idea but it's something that not a lot of conservation departments in this nation are doing what they're learning from and they're going to try this is actually a national level version I you know it's not\n... I I wouldn't say it's is is detailed is what I just went through but it's there I met a lot of great piece but I but I Want you I I Want you to hear what was going on and when she when she was here some good information that we learn we learn that Arizona's economy is up\nWe learned that airs on employment as\nWe learned that unemployment is down and people are spending more do you understand that the outdoor world here in Arizona is a multibillion bill ... with a B dollar business it really is we spend here in Arizona and it's not something\nThat I'm I'm trying to encourage you later on the show a minute I'm going to talk about you know how to really get into it without a lot of money so I'm not encouraging a monk urging people to go out and spend\nThat time ago but we do we spend we spent and that money goes towards conservation because when I talked about the Pitman Robertson act ... at the beginning of this show\nI talked about the tax benefits they go and actually fund the conservation efforts of the game and fish department I mean eight hundred species they've got to deal with you hundred that right\nEight hundred species\nThat's no joke right eight hundred that is more than any other non coastal state in the nation\nYour Arizona game and fish department worked hard to maintain proper levels proper populations of eight hundred species that's fun I it it's fantastic\nHere's what I found though and this is what you're going to have your and you hear me preach four years of this show\nHave for five years I'm going to do for another five and then another five after that God will is the next generation and that next generation does not have to be young that can be older can be middle age it just the next wave the next group\nOf outdoors men and women\nThe milder and back I Want to absorb the outdoors\nAnd it helps me when they were [laughter] to calm down for her house via\nBut I just I I Love getting that air I Love\nBeing around the trees are to golf courses on the way as a park and I just I just feel good I just soak\nUp that energy I soak up that that that fresh air that that wonderful ... given off by ... points I Love it I Love being in the outdoors I truly do\nAnd these doctors this is some hippie holistic nonsense this is what\nOur body was designed to do understand that we don't get vitamin D the vitamin D we need from our foods the vitamin D we need comes from the sun or skin absorbs that\nAnd the vitamin D is a key to our both our physical and our emotional or spiritual wellness and it comes from the sun\nAnd not a lot of it I'm not telling you to go out there and get burnt\n\nNot telling you to do that and it takes like I think ten minutes you're you you hit your limit just ten minutes soaking up some sunrise\n\nNow this isn't just to the U.S in the u._k. the benefits of spending time in the force was extremely research in Japan in the eighties by the way that's right\nResearchers found that just two hours in the woods could reduce blood pressure and stress hormones and boost concentration in memory\nGay Japanese study eighties Joanne O'Connor\nResearch and found out that two hours in the woods could reduce blood pressure and stress hormones and boost concentration\nIn memory and the chemicals were released by trees called oh boy here we go fight tennis sides I guess actually boost the immune system\nOh like how they call it the practice of forest bathing or Shinrikyo coup height\nAnd it's one of the national health\nPrograms in Japan this is fantastic ... everything that I Am ...\nJust to get outside you don't have to go hunting just get outside and have fun try paddle boarding we're talking with a little bit later tried kayaking try hiking trail running whatever you want to do try something\nIt's an ...\nScience has proven it yeah I Know science is proven what else science brew that it's okay we talk about as outdoors men and I'm Talking about men outdoorsman\nConservative guys you know may we look at some of these boys out there with their skinny jeans and beans and they're paying sagging and we're just thinking oh my goodness sakes these are the this is the the dating pool that our daughters are gonna have to deal with\nIt what did those those aren't boots that you're wearing those are some designer weird things I I don't even know what you owe\nIn wire crux even the thing it's making me my head hurt and now Birkenstock sir back what you say [laughter] [noise] I had\nLunch with a good friend of mine ... actually she is a legend in the media world here in Arizona\nAnd she now writes ... she's found a niche and it's awesome she actually writes\nDid a study\nAnd they looked at online profiles for all of the dating sites that you can eat ... even including tender\nAnd they found out that the majority of women preferred profile pictures of men that were holding fish you know the fish grew up in Grand hey look what I call\n... ... you heard that right the majority of women want to demand that had a dead animal\nAnd I told that to lower than I thought that she was gonna just freak out about it as real like oh that's just terrible no she goes that's exactly right it could be that it could be Gulf\nIt could be something in nature it could be something of them alone doing something out doors she goes because what that tells a lot of the women that tells a lot of women that are the demand that they might want to date or are they at least want to connect with to see if there's a connection\nIsn't going to be under a foot all the time isn't going to be ... they they have other pursuit they have other things that they like to do they don't need to be ... is cleaning is bad\nSo they found out that the majority of women and even ... who does this for a living she writes\nOnline dating profiles she said oh yeah\nShe goes is good to show that men have something to do in the outdoors the women air are naturally attractive that go ahead and call me sexist and fire off on me I I don't care there there are genetics at play here\nShe said but but besides the genetics that are at play\nWomen want to see that men have something else to do instead of I Want to cling to you and I need you to you know the filling out a new mommy issues whatever it is\n[laughter] [noise] but how about that how cool is that so we have\nDoctors prescribing outdoor pursuits for people for their overall wellness and we have a\nDating apps that have confirmed that women prefer seeing profile pictures of men with\nFor society ladies and gentlemen for society because that's when we preach here on the gosh we preach getting outside having fun and yeah take a picture of why not and speaking of taking a picture of it\nMy friend La Russa found herself in a lot of hot water because of a picture she took him I tell you about that next right here on the go show well welcome to guinea Ken Hi you're new nine green we some some good how do you make it\nHigher quality and green in line I mean we got from ...\nTrying to heal line Jane ... Fox News\nPittsburgh or hearts are broken Pittsburgh\nMayor Bill de do do on NBC's Meet the press on Saturday morning synagogue massacre right\nMost importantly those without natural predators would they do it so the hunter becomes the natural predator they introduced into the system a natural predator that can call the populations and keep it healthy\nSo last forever and ever and ever and doesn't go extinct and doesn't die from weird diseases of overpopulation\nBut social media had the government so freaked out that they're now going to look into them they had to at least make a statement here's the other side of the ball low risk has more\nShares more read tweets she has probably more followers because of this\nHow cool is that because we understand as outdoors men and women whether you were into hunting and angling or not you will understand as an outdoors man or woman\nWhether you're into hiking biking whatever you want to do\nYou understand the north American conservation you understand\nThat we are used as hunters in English we are used to call populations and maintain healthy population so the entire ecosystem including the plants that you have outside the bees the bugs the birds\nThe bears everything survives in thrives and they'll come to the same conclusion\nBut understand that I I Know that we are trying to welcome one welcome all we're trying to get new people into our world\nAnd if those people are raised like snowflakes and aiming can't stomach a picture of a woman that is hunted for an entire week and had a successful hunt and poses for a picture they can't stomach that oh boy\nWe have a work cut out for us because I'm not going to stop posing a posing for gripping grants I'm not I'm not going to am I going to have one bleeding all over the place you know\nYou'll see a lot of the people that you see preparing for a picture of what their what their harvest the actual clean everything up and they don't want they don't want to turn people off\nBut there's just a certain thing\nAnd by the way like I mentioned earlier if you're just joining the valley if you're just You're welcome we love having you here in Arizona we're so excited that you're here we just we we were getting we have something for a little warning for you\nIs is not like where you came from hunting and fishing is a completely different sport here we'll discuss that next right here on the go\nBack out on my\nMind no where things are followers ... have already has a map\nHave to go twenty five hundred miles going along\nGoes to appreciate man and a couple of hours\nOf your weekend with us and I and I'm going to welcome you as\nWell if you were in here from out of town we have a very transient stay here we have a lot of people in from ah I Would say the mid west and please understand this this basically Chicago west a lot of Illinois fans here\nNew and we welcome you if you are in the outer world if you were raised in the outer world if you were a sports man or woman in the mid west and you are now a new to the valley I have a bit of information for you this is not the same sport [laughter]\nI don't mean to be mean I don't want to sound me I Want to be encouraging I'm not going to sound like I'm trying to sway you from a participating in our outdoor world just please know\nThat it's different here and I'm going to explain what I mean because if you have trees than hunted\nYour whole life you're not going to do much of that here if you have gone to Wal Mart or bass pro sports them as warehouse ... bellows and bought a tag for I don't know five do\nAnd a buck tag ... you're not going to get that here and if you have fish pond after pond and stream after stream and caught fish it's different here\nSo I'm not going to discourage you I'm going to encourage you because this is a whole different world so let's start with fishing\nAll right\nThis is not a ... you know every four or five cast your catching the fish 'cause that's mid west fishing that's Florida fishing that's some east coast places\nFishing is ... ... it's ... it's tough to call it fishing it's mostly catching that makes sense right here it's not so much so\nI'm going to encourage you if you are new to the valley in you are just starting to twitch if you just need to go fishing and not fishing I Need to catch some fish\nI'm going to send you to three so one of three spots\nThe Arizona fishing guides stripe or adventures or the hook up outfitters okay I Want you to hire a guide to show you how to fish in Arizona to tell you the tackled that you need the gear that you need\nWhere two fish when to fish\nAnd the the species that you're going after don't be afraid of that\nBecause a lot of people say Iran fish in my whole life\nDon't need to get a guide and no it's in Arizona it's a different ballgame you have come to a different sport\nI Would think California's the same way Novato ... basically to say the southwest it's different than what you used to do\nThey're not putting in the time the effort the resources there they're not\nThey're not freaking out that they only have three days to hunt because that's all they could get off of work and that's for their entire week of a season that's the only time they could get out there\nThat's ... that's darn near Arizona exclusive but it makes it better\nIt makes it more fun and I'm going to encourage you to do it and I'm encouraged you to stay here to the show because we're gonna we're gonna celebrate those first steps and we're gonna get you out there ready celebrate we're going to get Sean ideas to mentor to be men toward to find resources and to experience hunting\nThe Arizona way and to be proud of that\nIt's coming up next check this out I Want to encourage you to do something that not a lot of people do in this world and the big box stores are going to get mad at me for saying that\nI have the best tip for the outdoors coming up next\n... says that I'm ... I'm not\nI'm not trying to scare you away if you're new to the valley I'm just saying that it's\nA different type of hunting and that's all [noise] why wouldn't you want to have your expectations properly set [noise] instead of getting out there and going where the deer where the where the ... where the rabbit where do where the quote what you\nJust set your expectations properly that's all I was trying to do\nNo because you you know because you're growing up in this whole millennial kind of a world where everybody's afraid of everything I'm not trying to be mean I'm just saying you need your expectations that properly that's all\nChanged him saying All right\nAnd that's what I Want I Want everyone here to have their expectations properly set when they go out and hunt or they go out and fish in Arizona if you're not from here it's just a different way of doing things either hire a guide to go fishing I strongly encourage that\nAnd do your research when you're hunting that's all\nAnd especially the regulations to make sure you you you get familiar with the laws here in Arizona they might be different I haven't hunted and a ton of other states just probably three or four or so that the laws and the regulations seem about the same but you know be different than where you're from so\nTake a look they're available at Walmart and you get the regular Wal Mart and get the rags or at a sports man's best broke a bell is\nNo way are most major outdoor retailers are\nI'm going to like I said before the break I'm going to encourage you to do something that the big box stores are going to get upset at me up\nBecause I wanted to encourage everyone to just start trying things I don't care what it is it could be ATVs like we talked about it early in the show could be hiking you can be running it could be\nA it could be paddle boarding and could be kayaking hunting fishing whatever it is\nI just want you to try something new in the outdoors\nAnd your doctor is going to thank me by the way you can say yeah I Know I I have a lot better attitude and I feel better and I'm healthier and my soul feels great all because of Mike from the show\n[laughter] give me credit well you know it's funny but yet but tell your doctor I've been getting outdoors a lot and I feel good that's what the deal and goes fans for\nGo outdoors get outdoors great outdoors ... anything you want to say just has to be outdoors I Know somebody is going to figure out a funny thing with the geo but go for it I don't care but what a lot of people\nThink is you know hey listen I Know the economy's up I Know that the job market's doing well but you know doesn't change the fact that I've got three kids and I put in one through college and you know I'm working two jobs and you'll finding time is one thing\nA man getting outdoors is expensive I'm going to push back a little bit on that of course on me\nI'm going to say that getting outdoors whether it's hunting fishing or yeah okay so let's go let's go hiking you gotta buy yourself a nice PR hiking shoes 'cause you don't want to you don't want to ruin your feet ruin your legs from your knees were hips\nI advise a nicer maybe like a camel pack or something like that so we are talking about a hundred and fifty two hundred bucks that's nothing to sneeze at and I'm not saying that's no no money it's that's a good amount of money\nBut then what do you have to buy Everytime we go hiking nothing\nSay there is an initial investments in getting outdoors yes there is and then it just ... fuses itself overtime\nAnd it drops itself over time\nI'm going to say that that hunting fishing heck of a lot less expensive than golf I mean you buy a five hundred dollars to the clubs and then you've got to pay a hundred hundred and fifty dollars every time you want to go golfing you buy a five hundred dollar shock on you got to spend you know what Fifteen bucks on shelves\nEvery time you go it's cheaper than golfing\nAnd by the way when you're done hunting you actually have something to eat and to serve your family\nWhen you golf it's hard to eat a golf ball\nIt is\nBut here's my advice to you and it doesn't have anything to do with an outlay of do\nEither borrow or rent\nDo not go out and say I want to try this discipline and this was why the big box or is it going to get upset with me don't say I Want to try this discipline and then just go out and deer yourself up and then give it a try please don't do that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The GO Show with Mike Russell", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "28"}
