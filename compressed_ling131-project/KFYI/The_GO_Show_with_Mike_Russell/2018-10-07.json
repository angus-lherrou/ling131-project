{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "If it's going to cost you money and you know ten or they can always pick up the phone and call us if if you're if you've already talked with one of these companies and you want to get a second opinion call us Carol rights for eight oh seven seven six five two three one because what tends said is true we have saved\nOur home sellers as much as fifty to Seventy thousand dollars over these other companies that's a lot of money can oh\nIt is not our money is in our homes our amateur money why would you give that away it's just doesn't make any sense and and you know people don't know what they don't know they don't do they think okay it's okay to do this and it's easy and it's fast and it's convenient\nBut how what a price to pay for convenient yeah ... you know ... you got to think of it is yeah it's like hey this is how I look at us like you know Las Vegas is a big site and right and those electric bills are pretty big ... paying for those electric bills that would be those gamblers nothing right yeah yeah\nSo it's the same scenario you know you see these commercials you see these big things going on out there and uh who's paying for that you the consumer well one of those things\nTo him that that we know and that is that the current race team we are working with with about nine thousand I'll just rounded up nine thousand buyers and so what you said it's very critical ask ask that agent or that party how many buyers are you working with that would be a good candidate from my home\nMany many real estate agents will run and they'll list that property they'll walk out and they'll say okay now I got to find a buyer and I got to find out why\nDon't you find the virus comes into the scheme of marketing and that is on the traditional side obviously\nA so they have to market the house a defined that would be buyers uh we're dealing with the type of a database of folks that we've already done a fide got their information phone or email if they've been qualified all that going through that process\nIf you already have the buyer will we do and I think I Would just want to add to this uh uh Carol as a we expose your home\nTo you know nine thousand parts they all see it they said and and there will be maybe twenty thirty folks in there and that\nHave the exact match it we celebrate their hand ... but in our data and our slush and our criteria\nIt matters about the schools matters about the ZIP Code level if his basement ... two story yeah exactly thanks for clarifying that\nIf it is a three bedroom four bedroom office in frequently wrote all of that information and that's how we sorts and sift through it but everybody sees that we do exposure home to everyone because parameters do change buyers will say hey I'm looking for this but really you know I I could\nI could go over here for extra in this direction\nSo it's about the exposure you get for your home and and that's what I'm that's what takes our steps off the chart in selling for more money and are getting top dollar for the homeless because we\nProbably already have the buyer really into database yeah so that that is a real key a question to ask you to have your\nUh talking talking to an agent talked to a family member or friend or or past agent or maybe ... to ... anyone these are really good good thoughts and sticking point says hey just ask them ...\nThere's we do we ... we'll show him to you yeah what you want to put your address in and home in and we'll kick out the buyers right there in front of you has we have no problem sharing that information for you because we have the system on the back end developed or that we can show you and many times these folks will uh obviously come in and buy\nIt and if you are listening just tuning in a worse here in the KFYI studio right here downtown Phoenix the Suzie Q a rice real estate show we're here every Sunday from two to three PM ah in Studio today is my lovely mother Carol Royce hey\nThere everybody you've been you've been hearing from me for a while and Pamela I thank you to you sir are coming in because that Vicki had added pitched it for her a little bit yeah I've just been shedding for her but you know I'm One of the things that we do know ten because we do sell real estate as it is our career is that the market is taking a long\nIt is and uh next week I've got a ... ... hopefully a you guys can get it next week and listen to the show because I'm really going to break down the real estate market as far as numbers are concerned uh we're what we're doing we were sort of\nThree quarters of the way through the year and a yard out last quarter left but ah I I have a an indication of sort of thought process of what this mark is going to do\nComing into twenty Nineteen and carrying us through you know the the mid part of it and uh folks or you're gonna wanna tune into a listen next week because uh also if you have a second home out there I I think it's critical that you you get on the you know get on the station with us next next week can listen\nTo my mind is something else too we've been really good at selling we were getting a lot of people that are calling and saying you might have got around property I'm had ten years twelve years five years or whatever that whatever the story is but I'm kind of tired of being a landlord can use salad with the tenant and what's your response to that\nAbsolutely we we can definitely help you if you have a tennis or we worked very diligently what's your what's your tenant and um you know\nBecause it's a ... it's of it is ... with us to attend\nCollege is not the easiest but we've got a system for\nAnd we do have we do have a great system for it and uh we're we're ... we understand how to deal with the tenants and their sensitivity because like you don't want to lose ... but there is some sensitive things are and how to how to maneuver and how to show the home and how to get an offer on that home where we'll cash out at top dollar for you\nWe're going to talk about if you do have a investment properties out there are some thinking I'm what you might want to consider coming into fourth quarter a first quarter of next year\nA possibly selling that we're we're going to give you some information they're also we're going to have ... on next week with us

them and sort of where the economy's going and just some insight there\nBut uh it's I'm Glad I got a chance to come and it's been a while\nIt's been a while and then so hey we want to thank you for

should do call my real ...\n[noise]\nThe deadliest transportation accident in the U.S in nearly a decade I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News twenty people killed in a crash involving a limo in upstate New York\nAnd\nI then they told me it was that help and brewing and I'm like okay that's cool oh wow and then they told me that uh there was a dream sponsor a ... society\nKicking in two drinks per person well this is on heard of\nIn the world or conservation apartments in the other forty nine\nConservation apartments looking at Arizona scratching their going to really you did that hey that's that's kind of cool and the reason I bring that up is because I Want you to know that that there are a handful of people\nAt your Arizona game and fish department that are innovators Scott lab in Doug Bert just their innovators they want to do things new and exciting they want to\nFind new ways to bring people into our world they want to find new ways to reactivate\nPeople they want to find new ways to do welcome any type of help like a group of mentors so you get a taco bar which you had me at taco bar then they put it in a cool brewery into a fund trivia night and it was\nReally neat seeing everybody come through the door and they're ready they ... they were all engaged all night and I think the event was ah for about four or thirty\nEight thirty or so before our event everybody engaged everybody on board and I mean from all walks of the outdoors where we had great prize is fantastic\nPrices being oppressed I brought up my men T I gave them you're switching tolerating Clementi if I'm a mentor these anti Rob hunter who you met last week the right here on the show and\nRob I I've been mentoring robbing the outdoors for about two years it's been a lot of fun of introduced him to a different hunting or some camping and we've had he's now he's hooked he loves the outdoors\nThen I brought him up to do the the drought the draft will let me try that again I mean some coffee drawing raffle together apparently as draft will [laughter] he wasn't drawing tickets for the raffle the draft ...\nAnd he was a ... as he was drawing a the tickets I was telling this story about him mentor and he didn't know I was going to about me mentoring him he didn't know I was going to do this\nSo I I Want everybody know because there was a little bit of not tension but you could tell people like why did he just grab this guy and brought 'em up here because I I knew that there was the tension so I just said listen guys Rob knows and I tell everybody\nIf you want to get into the outdoors I Love it I mean I can help you in any sing in any way I can imagine if you want to be a hunter\nLive up to his last name by the way if you want to be a hunter or an English you've got to have some thick skin because we are a trash talking law and that's our that's our way of saying you're you're All right you're one of us we we we put an awkward situation to replace them jokes\nYou play jokes on us we we talk trash it's just what we do it's fun gotta you gotta let that stuff ... and as I was telling that story see all of their heads in the in the crowd just does not like yeah you're darn right yes\nIt was really neat because they said that you're right when I said he was hooked everybody started clapping and it's just a just a really cool welcoming group but I bring up the innovation once again the innovation that your game and fish department likes to do in trust me they're working on\nIf you think oh I've got a great idea good tell them that in most likely they will say we're working on something just like that once again we're dealing with a government in state agency\nIf things don't move as quickly as let me put it this way I see this in the business world a lot I Need people to move with the speed of me that's why next week you're going to see a brand new website up for the show\nUh because I Want I I Want to move it my pace I don't want to wait for anyone else I Want things to move the speed of me so when when I tell the game and fish my ideas I Know we've got a long road to go and I just have to know what I'm dealing with but\nI Know that the wheels are in motion or people are champion championing the idea\nAnd they're trying to move it forward it just takes a little longer than what I called the speed of me and by the way I'm not fast by any stretch of the special comes running I don't run if you see me running police called the police and being chased them out of animal [noise] I hate running\nI it just it just right right here and I heard they they had this this oh just a we have a few more spots open for the I think is the PC age five gay or no five pint yes I'm a five point we can do the ... that's an idea actually write that down don't steal my ideas\nBut anyway [laughter] either that square they have\nAt your game and fish a lot of cool things coming up and I want you to get over to a Z GFD dot org I'm seat or sorry dot com now they're

think about all the time [noise]\nTo take a selfie know some days I just go to bed but oh man and post anything today oh I get down on myself war so I learned\nBut the gala events is going to be on the go through sixty\nFive dot com is going to have a lot of input because of the fall hunting seasons that are coming up and all the camps that are going on and all the events or just to show that I'm not all about just hunting and\nFishing I Want you to pay attention to your Arizona State park system ... the state parks is one of the best organizations around and they have\nA program that they run during the fall months it's fantastic ... teaches families how to camp and I mean paying the bullets and this isn't sitting around in a classroom this is actually going out and camping day teach you how to put a tent up they teach you how to cook\nThey teach you star gazing there I'm sure they teach and makes more they teach you how to fish they have all of the equipment you just pay the I think it's Ninety bucks for the whole family for the weekend you can't take the family dinner for Ninety bucks and you bring food\nThat's it and you could bring the basic stuff too hot dogs burgers whatever and they'll teach you had had to make a fire whole night yes state parks got gotta go oh they're family camping stuff really really cool stuff now in by the way that the state parks we have here\nSo the owner of ... going to be full full of the fall hunts now there are a lot of hunting opportunities in the fall\nWe got second half a dozen starting Thanksgiving weekend we had quail starting ... around the corner we have duck we have goose a rabbit three sixty five that I mean we we got everything's as predator hunting of it all year round\nThere's a lot of hunts going on and of course the big ... up north the deer elk or that I actually I say up north my dear hundreds down south\nI have a Lena ... there's so many opportunities going on I wanted to put a calendar together that you could just go to and say oh okay they followed all the way across that's\nThat's this hunt that's that hunt this is\nThe season we're in right now and you know I'm not going to put every ... like a six be\nElk archery\nNo I'm not I'm not going to put every tag hunt I Will put various tags and this is we're now in oak season we're now in archery you know what I mean it'll be on there and there's a lot going on so I'm going to have a lot of the events from a different societies the different communities\nAre different events like the paint night mentor event that we had last week and all that stuff will be on there for you to have a one stop shop to just check in\nAnd check it out what you think the prepping for ... and that's the problem this is the problem I'm running into now that I'm I put a lot of my stuff away for from the summer\nI'm now looking into making sure that everything is readily accessible for the fall hunt for my fall activities and by the way I'm actually gearing the kayaks up for some fall activities are going to get to that in a couple of weeks as well\nBut I Want everything accessible meaning the top of my black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow been stacks\nThat are taking over an entire wall of my garage because they are ... best invention for main caves ever or garages ever\nYes the black and yellow bins you see at home depot you see I'm at a Lowe's you see 'em a Costco Sam's Club\nThere everywhere and they are great get them\nI don't care if they're on sale full price whatever they're worth every penny those stacks need to have all of the stuff that I Need at the top okay so obviously my dogs my all my dog's been is is right up top because the dog you go on the bird hunts with me\nUm there's there's the shooting stuff the bird box everything is right up top it's dividing it out then I'm finding it to\nBe the issue and when we prepare for our fall hunt it should be it really should be as easy as just throwing a\nBand in the back of the truck and knowing that you have everything in there for duck\nYou know when you have everything and therefore the dogs you know and you have everything in there for ... whatever it is it should be that easy it should be plug in play so here's the wonderful idea that I found this is awesome what you find is a common denominator for everything that you're taking on this hunt on these on whether it's whether it's a pack\nOr whether it's a bird belt once again cue five fantastic belts\nI ... in the dog the quit all that stuff all stay in a central been this is what I found in all of the other stuff like if I if I'm duck hunting so the calls and you know the the other dogs stuff\nThem and try to get my sister's dog he's a lab I'm going to see if I can give them to retrieve a duck this year it's kind of one of my goals [noise] pray for me\nAnyway ... those are the little bits those are the little bands that are just now it's the big thing that goes in stays in the truck darn near the entire fall and winter\nAnd then the or the other stuff goes on I'm just going to go I'm going to go goose hunting today so here's the ... and the the calls and everything's in this band boom but here's everything else that I usually take when I go hunting for birds\nYou see what I'm saying it's it's just\nAbout organization and what this is going to do is going to eliminate a lot of frustration for you and I mean\nOf because he takes his meat very seriously and I think\nYou should do and I should do this is why this was important is was this was this at a lot of\nTakeaways and one of the first things I thought of if you're headed up north or to for for your for your tag God Bless you for ah getting attacked congratulations or be safe\nAnd really take this I I think this is one of the neatest part when you're processing knife blade out that's right digging pullout begin pullout or Cape or if you have a camping knife that's the way to do it\nBut make sure you're always pulling out in a way from the meat because if you push in that poll that puts hair into the ... and ... just ... it's not impossible but it's a big pain in the butt to get that becomes the glitter\nThe fall hunting right if you're doing it that way and by the way every year that I processed I've done it that way I just cut right down to start cutting as jets where you've got so that's the way it cut\nI wasn't getting that blade in there\nAnd didn't actually working the hair away from me\nI was doing that at all and I loved what he said there there there was a part that he had the the hiring quarters up any polls all the ... pulls around roast Audi pulled that the ... every piece of primate addict any pools\nOf this for big chunks of beautiful venison in front of it\nAnd he goes look this is not\nFor Cuban this is not for ... this is not\nFear ground meat pile these are these are prime cuts he goes you ... you hear these things and you go low and slow with them and you get it to the temperature that is as low as you could possibly get for the comfort of the people that you're serving it to\nThis is meant to be ... medium rare type of ... this is these are prime cuts\nAnd ... the reason why I'm telling you about this is I I Want you want you to be inspired to understand that what you've done when you harvest an animal from the wild\nIt whether it's an elk or a dear is a big game like that moves careful wherever you're at\nIs that this attention to detail is so inspiring and important and it's something that we need to really follow because I Want you to think about this back\nIt up I think about how much time and resources you've put into this tech in Arizona you know exactly what I mean in the years ... years of doing research years of bribing the ... the buddy with a lot of points [laughter]\nYes years you put in this then you put it in the money for all the gear the time off of\nWork the times scouting when you can't even shoot and you're just sitting there staring at a bunch of deer deer up for Halloween you know right where they are you just staring at a meeting and them scouting this is the driving me nuts\nThat of course you get the dumb but all of that time to time\nAway from your family all of that then do you send that to me to a process if you send me to a processor and you don't process it on your own I hear this well you're just going to get someone else's meet back you're not going to get the actual\n... okay if that's ... by the way if I send my me two processors that's exactly what I assume in I don't care it doesn't bother me\nIf I'm expecting three hundred and ten pounds of elk I if I get three hundred and ten pounds of el ... summer sausage ground whatever it is roe stakes whatever I'm good I really don't\nCare it does it does that does not bother me but that really seemed to drive a lot of people nuts and the thought of it initially drove me nuts but I thought well why am I getting when I Do I care\nThat's fine and I'm sure I Do get it back as I the the processor that I well my group views the Big Jim used um it it just I I had a good vibes highly recommended good reviews all of that probably the meat you brought as the the animal you brought us to meet you get back\nBut I like to process on my own I think it's fun it's enjoyable it's Zen like it's part of the process\nIf you are going to boast or speak of\nThe fact that you know where your meat comes from a to Z you know where it's been the whole time because you've handled the old time then start processing your own stuff I think that's part of the process in fun and by the way you get to get new gear you to get a butcher table you get to get a grinder\nYou don't want to go to school a little uh what's your paper dispenser things a great idea is part of the process here's what I learned and I'm going to look into this and do some research on the talk to some chefs around him\nHe said just Steve or know sucking about about not using a food processor not food press excuse me a food saver a vacuum seal it and he said he uses that for\nFish you thanks for fish that's okay I freeze\nMy fish and water but vacuum ceiling fish that's what he likes to do it\nBecause you use that and then he said for\nThe red meat no he said the red meat if you do it right if you wrap it in um have you wrap it in clear wrap plastic wrap and get all the ... out of it and just wrap it wrap rabbit then wrapping butcher paper he's talking about in the right phrase or two years\nStates fresh I did not know that\nI got to figure that out because I got the food saver I put all my dove in there and I had some do from last year before last season started and it was wonderful great it kept the whole year\nI don't know really about because you know dubs are redder meat so it I don't know if that's the same thing but I I really got to look into this because he was like yeah what's your papers but your paper for a reason it's been that way for a very very dry\nRight what his cell phone journal ... are you kidding me cell phone journal link optics and coach Tony Marquez it's coming up an hour or two of the Ghost

plant that seat I'm not saying you don't get into it and really find the best note taking suffer no it's right there on your phone don't get fancy give it a shot just plant that seat so when you are in the field and you think um\nAnd I really ... I I really should have that or I could use that or or how about this or your buddy has something to take a picture of it put it in your notes take a picture of it and remind yourself to look into that when you get all that easy and speaking of that we're talking about processing in in the last segment we're talking about a processing big game\nOnce again don't be afraid to download those processing videos to your phone maybe you download those to your phone then you have that they're all times\nSo when you are actually processing you can refer to it there's no shame in that let the pros teach you until you become the absolute pro a process processing pro [laughter]\nKids these days they carry that with their video games and there may spaces and all that fun stuff I'm telling ya\nVideo
