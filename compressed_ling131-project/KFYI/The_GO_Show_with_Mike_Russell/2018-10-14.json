{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KFYI", "content": "We don't quite a few I bought a lot a lot of history there and it is is it is a tender situation because many landlords don't want to disturb or upset and we don't either no we don't\nUm and we have the knowledge of how to do that yeah and some tenants are very agreeable to to help out and they want to help out and uh it it really helps us out somewhere like ... you know I'm not going to you know they don't tell us but the knock and make the beds and the dishes and stuff like that it's okay but\nWe've got a system did we get in your homes sold with that tenant and it\nAnd and keeping that lease in place and the tenant has something in the ... called quite enjoyment so so that means that they don't have to allow showing but we've got a system for that and we've done many of those the other thing to him as if they if they're on a month to month the tenet is on a month to month that's much easier for us\nTo be very easy a piece of cake or we can really help in that at ... at least a month to month I mean are sent makes lots because of the leases doesn't have that long a period of time for the\nRight right and and again a week so so then if it's month to month we give the ... the ... the landlord gives the tenet thirty they notice and I would say that most of the time once that candidates out Tim it might take us like ten days to two weeks to get that home sold quick so you really\nYeah I'm not a loss yet the vacancy there's hardly write anything and writes it's you know changing order ships and uh you know your cash and equity and getting that a subtle\nWe just did one ah over in the west valley uh for one of our great customers Jeff he had a tenet month to month tenet I went into my view of the house and I said you know Jeff it'd be better without the tenant in here and so he gave them a thirty day notice\nTenant moved out we put some new carpet in because it was pretty trashed he was he was very dismayed to see the condition of that house we he he painted a few rooms we put the house on the market in two weeks we had a full price offer on that house and he's just saying hallelujah well because\nYeah another story that happened to the decline of mind Tricia they had three properties and I'm a there were used and you know they did a nice job they bought these back in the old nine timeframe away timeframe at three properties using the ... were\nDown and you know using the equity of those rental properties for their retirement yeah heart yes\nAnd uh we all three of them just writing one we had him for about a week or two sold them the tennis for just a vacating ... matter of fact had one tenant and when we were able to handle you know diligently got that closed for

it I really do ah we got when I say we have a big show I spoke last week about what to do a no not what you do I last week I spoke about video games right\nAnd rainy days like we've been having great time for outdoor video games is a fantastic\nTime for outdoor video games like I said my kids would set up the uh the couch blind they would they put up the couch cushion to make it look like a hunting blind and we'd play the ... video games like with I think we still have the we console but yeah\nIt's all moved over to the X. box and all that but it's a great time for video games it gives you fix I promise you should give it a try you can buy a super cheap you go to the games to actually get them used super cheap\nAnd trust me it will give you a little bit of a fixed just rains sometimes throws you off but we do have a big show so the hunting shows that I've been talking to you about have been ranked in I Want to give you those rankings 'cause I think we were right on par\nAnd I'm going to introduce you to a new way of watching television as well\nAnd then I have to get I I I'm going to do my best not to get preachy because I I don't like that I don't think anyone likes that there was\nA happening that has to do with defending a home with a fire\nAnd I really want to drive a couple of points home it will do so in a non preaching manner I promise I'll I'll Try to I Will do my best and then there is new technology in the outdoor world is coming out of California\nThat uh uh two buddies of mine out there in the News World are they did some uh some reporting on and it's absolutely fantastic I Can't wait to tell you about that it's going to save lives\nAnd then I have a new story that's right I have a a a mentor story for you that you are going to if if you've ever shot a bow and arrow\nYou're going to just blow your mind\nTo great story and then we had a technical glitch last week where the first part of our second hour just didn't play so we're going to replay that because I think it's very important is talking about cell phone journalist\nYes I said cellphone journal and you heard that right and then we have some just outlandish products that I've seen in the hunting world but I've got to tell you [laughter] that's off the rails and I'll tell you some of the best as well\nIn a few of those are right here in the great state of Arizona they're made right here in Arizona okay so a lot of cool stuff in the in the outdoor world and then there's some\nStuff that I really can see immediately why they didn't take off\nBut in seeing them I thought okay I I kind of get where you're going this but ... yeah\nBut it has been um it it's been a lot of fun this week I've been working with Dan taught at easy firearms and it was his birthday so a big happy birthday you don't look at day over thirty buddy to Dan taught from our partners that easy firearms and we're working with them getting new age\nA shotgun to getting my son ... that is a very important thing to me is we have the second or half a double season coming up and we also have duct season coming up we'll goose season coming up uh we have quail season coming up we have it all\nSo I Am excited for that I Am excited to get him a shotgun and it's been a process and the reason why it's been a process is my son is like a ...\nIt's just it's just kind of ... is not a big bulldozers very thin kid he's long his arms are long fingers along his ... his feet are just built like skis he's in he's on his way to ... men size nine and he's ten years old\n\nSo but but he's he's very skinny is very thin he's not very strong and I don't mean that in a bad waste ten years old\nBut he is so it is weight of a shotgun is linked up a shotgun and it is the the record the recoil as a factor so now that we've kind of narrowed it down to fit which was a struggle\nWe have to have something that he can he can hold\nUp for a while right and he's going to be able to be in full control that farm at all times\nAnd so we're going to go out shooting hopefully or this week and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna see if we can really narrow it down because I have my eyes on one that I think will work but I might be a little too late to recall might be a little tough for him\nBut I Want him to match is dead or I don't think I Am you I don't think this unique to me I think I think you a dad wanting their son to have like match you met you Chuck guns in the field I think it's pretty cool it's pretty cool [laughter]\nPlease I Hope it works because it's affordable and I mean it's totally the right place price 'cause it's of course that he's you farm is the right price and I think it looks really cool and I think she's going to uh I think he's going to like the traditional wisdom of having a ... it's the over under to seize the over under\nAnd I was worried about that too and I guess we can talk about brands a little bit later but I'd never heard of seizing\nBut I asked to kill a gym one of my most trusted advisors when it comes to firearms and not surprisingly to kill a ... he said that he says he's he's a fantastic making model I mean a fantastic maker firearms and I did not know I never heard of them I Believe the Turkish\nSo to turkey got\nOh come on I got dad jokes for days All right let's do this let's take a quick break and then I Want to come back and I want to go over these I Want to go to these hunting shows with you once again I Am going to break down a new way\nTo watch TV [noise] oh yeah a new way to watch their not kidding I Know this is an outdoor show but I'm Talking about watching out doors shows [noise]\nAnd there's a few things that you're going to you're going to be pretty excited about so they would have basically it was a microphone\n\nReaction to the conservative circus that's been averaging we expected that a few things back\nIn the reserves or they're shaking her head [laughter]\n[noise] I was telling the story of me clipping my brother in law's front bumper\nWith the ... race in defense I was taking everybody lunch on the beach with her so I was I was I was\nGetting outdoors and I was taking everyone was I was doing nice stuff up judging me please [laughter]\nOh my goodness out before the break I was talking about a new way to watch TV Now I I have to admit this and I think the ... all of us have had this discussion before\nThat I was a late adopt or to social media I did not want to be a part of social media I did not want to have to post to social media I didn't want to have to deal with it I didn't want to have to deal with the drama to be honest with you it just it just seems like a especially politically oh\nIn my week day job when I Am a political commentator good nine eleven did you imagine what could you imagine what my social media if he looks like\n[noise] but I was elated doctor now it's just part of my breasts\nIt's just part of my day it's part of my it's part of my job I was told if I was going to be on radio\nI Would have to have social media can so I came along once again lay the doctor I never really thought of YouTube as social media early to I just thought it was a media platform\nAnd I have come around to all of the social media ... the majority of social media platforms as\nA tool for the outdoors you\nThink about it I Would say Instagram is the least of these but I'll tell you what Instagram does as far as advancing the outdoors it a\nMotivates me I think it motivates you to write you're seeing all these gripping grand pictures coming down from up north of these giant bowls these giant up now that we're in oak season you're seeing turkey pictures you're saying I you're from dumped season remember all those limits and all they just they're they're great you you scroll through and you're motivated\nAnd you feel that community because sometimes it's easy to go into maybe our work and people are like oh you ... oh those poor animals did you killing me this is what I'd get on Mondays did he kill any innocent birds over the weekend\n[noise] not sure that\nThat's what I'd get but it'd be you know go through ... through Instagram that guy was my people was about ... and then moving over to Facebook Facebook is fantastic as far as the groups are concerned like Arizona stripe or fishing is one of the neatest communities\nOn Facebook and if you want to learn how to fish for striped bass that's the spot you need to be and there's a Z anglers this there's there's there's groups everywhere brought it brother at all that stuff that I just if Facebook is good for the social media is good for that and\nThen now that I'm lumping YouTube in to the social media world YouTube is like watching TV\nIf you don't realize this that the majority of a I Would say the majority of America if they have not cut the cable cord they're considering it\nWas a big group\nAnd looks at the animals and they just die out of respect they just drop\n\nYour and other animals will come along and they will uh field dress that animal just out of respect for Jim shocking [laughter]\nAll right I got to get to a news story or that we got to talk about and is talks about firearms\nAnd defending your family is coming up next on the go\nTo Randy in your hand if I may you know for\n... more years of why I have the game any that you didn't know anything about due to all I knew how you do I just didn't know people use it as TV these\nAnd oh yeah he started rattling off different shows and he'd watch 'em like that is absolutely amazing it's just a new world it's not really a new world that you just stop laughing at me Sarah entering sort of the things that's so funny that she has an old uncle\nExcuse me employer or you're not employed if you're in and I don't know I don't know how it works but you're doing a bang up job\nAnd on that website by the way the go show three sixty five dot com it's it's still a work in progress we promise it's gonna happen this week I promise promised problems\nBut it's been it's like I said life happens if all the right guy also mentioned that'd be talking about a ... a news story that I read about someone through my hands and articles defending\nTheir homes with a firearm um that that discussion is probably a little longer our last segment of every hours a little bit longer I'm going to save it to that number it's going to vote will push that one we'll swap 'em with one of the fun stories I don't want to say I'm very excited about this 'cause the last few weeks I've been talking about men touring\nMentoring mentor a mentor I've been talking about getting involved with people that want to experience are outdoor world and when I say experience or outdoor world I don't care what it is it could be jumping in puddles in the rain\nI I don't care as long as it's outdoor just grabbed somebody and expose them now don't worry they'll get hooked\nI promise they'll get hooked\nOne of my buddies in an apartment the show ... Stevens he as a chef very talented chef end a new archer ladies and gentlemen yeah\nHow 'bout that he he sent me a I'm a picture of his new bow and he was very excited about this\nAnd I was excited for him so he said let's let's let's hook up I let's let's go shoot these boats are ... excited to get out there whether you show me how to do this thing and of course you know\nHe understands the outdoor role because he is an outdoorsman so he gets that he knows we talk trash and he's you know\nHe was like of course I'm going to be a natural that this whole thing I'm rolling my eyes and I'm rolling my eyes because he said okay let me to the archery range and so we we agreed which archery range we're going to go to\nAnd I started asking him questions because this was supposed to happen a couple of weeks ago than it was like the thunderstorms those big storms that's an obvious I'm not going to go to an outdoor archery range and deal with this noise\nSo I started asking him this is on Texas sort of asking him a different questions about the ... I said you know have you had it adjusted to you're drawing\nNope ah what\nWhat is what pounded you set up a ... ... ... ... excuse me uh what Mike okay first thing is you get over to shop and they need you to have them at the adjusted your drawings and what ever you want whatever weight you want to draw it\nAnd he said OK and like he was back in ... I ... back on taxing maybe an hour okay all done ...\nI've got it all I've got everything any and okay let's get this let's let's get this party started right and then I bought a day later he sends me a picture of a his target in his backyard and it's got to ... and he goes I think I'm good at twenty\nAnd so I'm impressed so okay good and by the way you can anyone can do that by the way that might have been that might have been Eighteen arrow sailing over the target and then to just happen to hit the ... [laughter]\nAh for ... it's going back to social media yet just always understand that their stories behind all of those perfect pictures you see of everybody so don't immediately get envious really think I think that through\nI think what it took to get to that picture anyway I get ... out there\nI I well let me back up I show up about an hour early\nAnd because I was I was between appointments and I thought okay well I'll just I'll just go just lob some arrows out there while I'm waiting for and so I get through I drawback wants out drawback twice how what the owner really thinking about it I was like that's oh that's kind of interesting\nMy out was on my lip\nI have a kiss or button on my on my boat string and if you don't really kissed her button is it's a it's a just a little plastic discs that goes a red above your knock and when you draw back it goes right to the corner of your lip treasure the core of your mouth and that's why they call it a kiss or button and the reason why you do that is so you have is the same\nAnchor point every time you get your nose on the string got kissed her button on the side of your mouth and you can you're you're looking down you're looking through the peep site to your pins in everything uh lines the same every time well mine actually correct\nSo or spun around so it it they it was ripping my lip as it went through so that was I was done with that I went for a walk [laughter]\nI put my stuff that I was I I just I Would go for cows Matt\nSo go ahead and get that fix this week\nSo ... rolls up and I'm just so I'm just beaming because I Love exposing in helping to expose people to any type of outdoor activity I Love it is my joy\nIt's so much fun that's why I Love that uh the the wild all the gene game and fish kid's camp I Love the wildlife are the markets camp it's fantastic exposing kids to the outdoors all\nMind and soul just filled loved\nBut heroes up and I I plan on hug on this guy by ... that pumped I'm like yeah let's go buddy\nAnd he's got his gear and we get out there and he draws back his first arrow unless the thing flying hits the ...\nI think okay right on any does it again\nDenny let's won the ... ... you miss this one right\nIn by the way if you're in shooting or or archery whether it's a farmer or bone marrow or\nIf you do that if you're hitting you know ten ringtone ring you're hitting the bulls eye and then once you sail one and anyone ever asked\nYou about it just said don't worry about that\nThat's your answer every single time [laughter] oh don't worry about what about that with don't worry about that\nWhen you talk about\nBut I said okay what do you what do you have your pin said do you ever been said at twenty your top instead of twenty or thirty he goes\nWhat I'm like you let me see I grabbed his ball I look at his parents his pins are straight out of the box there clump together in the middle of the site\nAnd I said you're doing this all on the hill and he goes yeah I'd like to me that dang ... let me go geez I get my Allen wrenches out\nAnd I START I start trying to get in there and I apparently don't have the right size Allen writes for this site I'd never been stumped on a site before but\nApparently I didn't have the right side\nSo we couldn't move it we could we couldn't a justice sites that were going to go back out there in about a week but he just kept swinging arrows and kept hitting a target we moved the thing the thirty he kept hitting his target he basically was shooting a compound\nBoth as a ... I was blown away\nHe took a shot and I said no no no work on your work I work on your form and he goes it's in the tent ring\nAnd then I said some bad words [laughter]\nHey\nI'm going to say this first you need to go get a concealed carry permit you need to take a concealed carry a class you didn't take a hunter safety course you can take a firearm safety course you need to educate yourself your going to have a fireman you're home\nPeriod you need to have to\nUh in the state of Arizona you do not need a a cw concealed carry permit to carry in the state\nThat highly recommend it\nIt's a matter of fact go do it now I I recommend Scottsdale gun club or because they think they're the best class I mean do the best instructors\nAnd they they it's fun it's actually enjoyable and one of the best things I learned when I took my class was a C. C. W. in a state that is not mandated to have one that the best thing about a sea so it's basically jury insurance\nYou could you imagine you're the person defending someone breaks in your home and God Forbid you have to shoot them that you actually you know you you going from a jury and the your defend your defense attorneys saying hey listen this guy didn't even have a requirement\nTo take this class and get the certification but he did and how he was acting during this breaking was how he was he thought he was acting in accordance with\nWhat he was ... and go get the class you learn things like that you learn what you can and cannot do there are people in every class that bring the instructors their firearms and say I don't want this any more it's not her responsibility that I Want it isn't what I thought it was and that's great\nYou have to have a farm if you don't feel comfortable on farms don't on a farm but\nThis guy you cannot I'll just I'll say right out of the gates you cannot in any way shape or fashion would you can't just open fire on somebody you have to be eliminating an immediate threat if a person is running away from you\nTrivia question first was running away from you\nAre they an immediate threat no\nYou don't fire people running wages because I had to secure for the safety of my family no no no\nYou need to know step by step what you can and cannot do and I learned that in the sea she W class you take a farm safety glass same thing you're gonna get the ... at the same information if not ask questions\n\nAnd I want you to really understand this you remind me really really understand you might think if somebody breaks into my house I'm shoot okay\nThere's a lot there there's a lot there I have a friend who well bring on the show you know his name oh God I kind of surprised\nHe saved a first responders life\nBy shooting the man that was trying to kill him and he killed the guy he killed the bad guy remember the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun and heard that a hundred times\nAnd he still suffers to this day he knew he was doing the right thing he trained for it he drill for it he practiced it\nAnd when the\nTime came when the rubber met the road he was ready any acted and he was successful but that success brought a lot of misery a lot of pain 'cause he's ... he has to deal with that now he killed someone that's not an easy thing to live\nSo someone breaks in ...

I'm not a big fan of hunting out of a tree standing is boring but there was ... I'm not ... I Can't make this up it was something called the tree with\nI think you know where I'm going with this it was a journal that you could hook along along the tree\nDeer stand along rubber tube that extended down to the tree and you would bury the you bury the reservoir you know in hopes that the deer wouldn't smell anything\nI I'm telling you when when I have to go to the bathroom it's like it's like a deer attracted\n... it happened to me twice and the first time I happened to me I was hunting in Missouri so not too surprising but something in Missouri and we were in a ... a ground blind by a food ...\nAnd we got to the spot a little bit early\nAnd I was a let's let's say that we had some we had some beers with lunch and then we're you know we're hydrated and we had our water and they're with us and they got about almost like perfect time like prime time son was starting to set\nAnd I couldn't hold it anymore I said I have to I have to get out here a whisper to make the ... I kinda got I got to go he's like come on man my seriously I get out and go round this thing and I started doing my business\nThat we get a million and tell us about taking inner city kids exposing the outdoors were fantastic idea but this man makes hands down the best bird vests there are period they are awesome and it's a local\nCompany American Made right here in the valley really cool stuff you're going to make cue five out door products dot com cue five outdoor products dot com you will not be disappointed I promise you\nProblems\nNow let me do this I've been getting a couple of emails about game because now we're an out of ... and people have dumb and they're freezing like I Can't think of a good way side of a pop or to prepare this let me help you out with game you taste okay let's talk about that next right here on the show\nI signed the most iconic brand and the booming cannabis industry just went bumbling joined me I PO now nine times over the break was they were fired off a little feisty\nWhy because the food [noise] as I'm sitting\nHere in these ... studios that has an entire just break room kitchen amazing ... dispensers\nThere cheese it's dispensers Skittles dispensers trail mix dispensers just free just go get near him complaining about hungry how 'bout I get off my rear end and go get some ... [laughter]\nSpeaking of which I was asked several times in the past couple of weeks since dubbed season because I talk about the seasons so much talk about how much I loved of a dive bomb I'd love to eat the other love to do hunt I think it's the best way\nTo get anyone into hunting but people ask me I just oh just it's going to taste game\nUnderstand the game me let me let me translate what gaining means gaming means it doesn't taste like beef chicken or pork yes and bacon ... big\nYet that's what I Want Sarah ... you need to go get me some bake yeah bake but that's gaining everything that doesn't taste like beep chicken and pork game\nAnd I'm okay with that because it's game meat it's supposed to taste like game meat\nBut there are some ways you can eliminate that the bad taste of game how 'bout that not the gaming is of gaming the bad taste\nBecause you just did some stuff from\nSo I have a couple of trips for ya among we're going to help you out with this one\nIt's it starts with field dressing it starts with either you're you're you're addressing you're dove duck a deer elk whatever it is\nYou need to make sure you're processing your dressing it correctly and there are countless videos online I obviously can't walk you through dressing a deer ... on air right now\nBut if you do not\nFeel dress your animal properly then it's just going to take it's not going to taste good\nOkay I understand that you know take steak tastes so good and pork and chicken and stuff like that it is processed by professionals it's done immediately and it's shipped quickly and it's it's yeah it's done by pros they process that right so it taste right\nThat makes sense\nAnd we feel dressing his key I mean there's a lot of\nPeople that will say that have a lean has just dirt me it's terrible you don't want it it stinks is awful and we're going to go make tree so as a matter of fact a guy used to hunt with he he would take a have a lean a ticket to his buddy that over by a man the new owned a a convenience store and he'd given to thirty packs for a trade it\n\nI say when they're on the guy that owns the convenience store I think he wins in that deal because once again and I I I Know I talk about it I think it's a wonderful show I watched one of my favorite programs mediators Stephen was talking about a ... and he said if it is field dressed properly it taste as good if not better than pork\nYou heard that right\nI died Google it you'll find the video we talked about YouTube earlier I'm sure it's on YouTube\nBank it is a wonderful meat if it is field dressed properly with me on that field dressed\nThe next the next thing you can do in this is I Would say so get but I don't want you to soak it in the standard way a lot of people say oh yeah I took my dove and I put it in a bag with seven up all night or buttermilk or something like wait a which would ...\nWould you do that was a rabbi would you do that with the full a do it\nSo why do it with your gay me that you process oh I don't want us to give it wants to go back to I don't want to ask him oh I'm marinate does for days\nMarinated every kind of marinated vine got your poll lemonade\nGot this herb as just had a peaches and herb [laughter]\nMarron and I got it all marinate married I'm married and they\nMade you know here's the deal if you're going to merit aid or soak meat in anything make it a just a simple brine okay\nSimple bright a salt water Brian with some with some ah herbs and there was some a little bit of you know whatever whatever you want to put in your brain you make any type of ...\nAnd ... the salt is going to solve it was going to help as well but just if you want to use a brand new to Bryan you if you're going to slow cook I always if I put gaming slow cooker I throw up Bryan on it but I don't do it to take away the taste I don't I Want it to taste like what it's supposed to taste like\nIt's supposed to take whatever animal it was or is he the past tense was not alive anymore was is still the same meat still the same thing\nServes looking at me like [noise] like Bogle looks at me when I don't give him a tree huh ah brining is a is a good thing brining brining is is something that you should do should try\nI I just once again you\nYou guys know how I I'm I'm stumbling through this because I Do I think it should be cooked you should take it rather you know put it on the grill\nThat's I'm that guy\nI think that's the way I I don't like covering it up with things you know salt and pepper is amazing some peppers way should\nThird job I have for you if you're having a problem with the game he tastes that go through my hands in air quotes game is silver skin let me tell you this goes from this isn't field dressing this actually goes to the processing taking the time to remove the silver skin in the connective tissue Z before you're cooking trust me it's going to pay dividends\n\nYou have a strong gave me you might have uh like the super dark red
